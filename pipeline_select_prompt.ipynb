      "Justice Ajit Kumar stated in the order that a person has the Constitutional right to change his/ her gender through surgical intervention. \n",
      "\"One should not have any doubt that if a person suffers from gender dysphoria and except for physical structure, her feeling and also the traits of opposite sex so much so that such a person takes a complete misalignment of her personality with physical body, such a person does possess a constitutionally recognized right to get his/her gender changed though surgical intervention.\"\n",
      "The Court went on to hold that failure to recognize an individual's inherent right to alter their identity in contemporary society would promote the persistence of \"gender identity disorder syndrome\".\n",
      "\"At times such a problem may be fatal as such a person may suffer from disorder, anxiety, depression, negative self image, dislike of one's sexual anatomy. If psychological interventions to alleviate such distress as above fail, surgical intervention should become a must and should be encouraged,\" the order stated.\n",
      "The petitioner, a constable employed by the Uttar Pradesh (UP) Police, moved the Court claiming to be experiencing gender dysphoria and wanted to undergo SRS to fully embrace male identity.\n",
      "The petitioner though assigned female gender at birth, claimed to be having all the traits of a male with attraction to women. The petitioner further claimed to have feelings of a male trapped in a female body. Accordingly, it was claimed that the petitioner was suffering from Gender Dysphoria\n",
      "The petitioner had applied for necessary sanction for the SRS on March 11, 2023, but no decision was taken.\n",
      "Before the High Court, counsel for the petitioner relied on the Supreme Court judgment in National Legal Services Authority v. Union of India, a landmark decision on the rights of transgender persons.\n",
      "It was pointed out that the top court in this case had held gender identity to be integral to the dignity of an individual and was at the core of personal autonomy and self-determination.\n",
      "He also cited Section 15 of the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019, which covers healthcare services such as SRS and hormonal therapy.\n",
      "Reference was also made to a recent decision of the Rajasthan High Court which permitted a physical training instructor to alter their name and gender in service records following a sex reassignment surgery.\n",
      "After hearing the arguments, the Court held that there was no justification for the DGP to withhold the application of the petitioner. Thus, the Court directed him to dispose of the pending application in light of the judgments referred to in the order.\n",
      "The Court also directed the State government to file an appropriate affidavit as to whether it has framed any such Act in compliance with directions issued by the Supreme Court in the NALSA case.\n",
      "\"However, it is provided at the same time that any such Act or Rule if has not been famed till date, the State Government will ensure to frame such Act at par with the Central legislation,\" Justice Kumar added.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Facts:**\n",
      "Neha Singh, identifying as male despite being assigned female at birth, claims to suffer from Gender Dysphoria, a condition diagnosed by a medical practitioner. She seeks to undergo Sex Reassignment Surgery (SRS) to align her physical identity with her gender identity. The petitioner has applied for necessary sanction for SRS to the Director General of Police, U.P. on March 11, 2023, but has received no response.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Arguments:**\n",
      "The petitioner argues that her right to undergo SRS is supported by the Supreme Court's ruling in *National Legal Services Authority v. Union of India*, which recognizes the rights of transgender individuals and emphasizes the importance of gender identity as integral to personal dignity and autonomy. The petitioner contends that the State is obligated to comply with the Supreme Court's directives, even in the absence of specific statutory provisions.\n",

      "**Decision:**\n",
      "The Court found no justification for the delay in processing the petitioner's application for SRS. It reiterated that individuals suffering from Gender Dysphoria possess a constitutional right to undergo surgical intervention to change their gender, as supported by advancements in medical science and the principles of dignity and autonomy.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Reasoning:**\n",
      "The Court referenced the Supreme Court's previous judgments, which established that gender identity is a fundamental right protected under Articles 14, 15, 16, 19, and 21 of the Constitution. It emphasized that the State must provide opportunities for individuals to live with dignity and that withholding the application for SRS would contravene these rights. The Court directed the Director General of Police to process the application in accordance with the established legal framework and to file an affidavit confirming compliance.\n",

      "The Calcutta High Court on Friday observed that Durga Puja is one of the most secular festivals and was not a purely religious one [Manab Jati Kalyan Foundation v. State of West Bengal].\n",
      "Justice Sabyasachi Bhattacharyya made the observation while ordering the authorities in Kolkata to permit an organisation to hold Durga Puja celebrations at a designated public ground in the city. \n",
      "The Court refused to accept the argument of the authorities that the petitioners, under Article 25 of the Constitution, do not have any right to perform worship in public parks, roads, foot-paths, etc.\n",
      "\"As is public knowledge, the Durga Puja Festival is not confined merely to the worship or religious offerings component of the incarnation of feminine power but also a melting pot of different cultures...Hence, there is as much an element of ceremony, cultural programmes, festival and fanfare involved as religious worship. In such sense, the Durga Puja Festival is much more secular in nature than a pure religious performance of a particular community and cannot, thus, be narrowed down to being a mere 'religious offering' of a particular community,\" the judgment said.\n",
      "The Bench was hearing a plea challenging the authorities' refusal to allow the petitioners to hold Durga Utsab 2023 in the New Town Mela Ground, which is used for the purpose of holding different fairs.\n",
      "The authorities raised several objections, which, according to the petitioners, were flimsy pretexts to refuse permission to them. The petitioners relied on Article 14 of the Constitution of India, arguing that they have equal right as others to hold a Durga Puja festival on the said ground.\n",
      "After hearing arguments, the Bench observed that the primary distinguishing feature in the present case is that the site at which the Durga Puja Festival is sought to be held by the petitioners is not a street or a foot-path or even a playground, but a specifically designated ground for holding fairs.\n",
      "\"No intelligible or reasonable differentia has been made out by the authorities between a Durga Puja Festival and ordinary fairs or other festivals designated to be held on the Mela Ground. Both entail huge footfall and gathering of crowds including parking of vehicles of the people who come to visit,\" the Court opined.\n",
      "It junked the argument that the Kolkata Police would be burdened if the Durga Puja is allowed at the site. It said such an argument is 'absolutely baseless' since it is a common feature in the entire State that there are numerous huge Durga Pujas organized by several entities quite close each other.\n",
      "The Bench added that the mere fact that a person resides or has office elsewhere cannot be a deterrent for permitting him to organize a festival on public property specifically designated for holding public functions.\n",
      "\"Article 19 of the Constitution guarantees that all citizens have the right to assemble peacefully and without arms and to move freely throughout the territory of India. The specific purpose of such rights shall be frustrated if people are refused permission by public authorities on the ground of their residing elsewhere, unless there is a specific intelligible reason for such discrimination or a policy decision in that regard, also based on intelligible criteria,\" the Court said.\n",
      "It was also noted that the petitioners had agreed to pay full charges, as sanctioned by law and procedure, for organising the said festival.\n",

      "The petitioners invoked Article 14 of the Constitution, asserting their right to equality and claiming that their request was unjustly denied while others were permitted to hold similar events.

      "\"This Court is of the opinion that such practice is unwarranted when such a serious and heinous crime is committed and also it amounts to hampering and tampering with the witness or evidence by the accused. It is surprising that such a heinous crime, which affects the entire society and the relation between ‚ÄòGuru‚Äô and ‚ÄòDisciples‚Äô should be viewed very strictly,\" the judge underscored.\n",

      "\"The hope of tomorrow rests on the children. But unfortunately, in our country, a girl child is in a very vulnerable position. There are different modes of her exploitation, including sexual assault and/or sexual abuse. The exploitation of children in such a manner is a crime against humanity and the society. Therefore, the children and more particularly the girl child deserve full protection and need greater care and protection whether in the urban or rural areas,\" Justice Dave observed in his order passed on November 30.\n",
      "In such cases, responsibility on the shoulders of courts to provide proper legal protection to these children is more onerous, the Court opined.\n",
      "A minor who is subjected to sexual abuse, the Court said, needs to be protected even more than a major victim.\n",
      "\"A major victim being an adult may still be able to withstand the social rationalization and mental harassment meted out by society, but a minor victim will find it difficult to do so. Most crimes against minor victims are not even reported as very often, the perpetrator of the crime is a member of the family of the victim or a close friend. Therefore, the child needs extra protection,\" the judge observed.\n",
      "In the present case, the single-judge noted that the accused was not a layperson but a teacher, which is the only career that influences other professions. \n",
      "\"It has the power to influence young people‚Äôs future for the benefit of future generations. The teacher is expected to act a protector. Such heinous acts by the accused would cast a lifelong psychological and emotional impact on the victim. Crimes like this by a person of trust, change the perception of a child to look forward towards life in a positive way. Therefore, the accused deserves no leniency,\" the Court underscored.\n",
      "The victim was barely a 12 years old and the teacher instead of showing fatherly love and protection to the child, made her a victim of his lust. \n",
      "\"It is a case where trust has been betrayed and social values are impaired. Therefore, the accused as such does not deserve any sympathy and/or any leniency,\" the Court observed.\n",
      "It further referred to the statement of objects and reasons of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act and said even the Articles 15 and 39 of the Constitution of India, provide protection of children from the offences of sexual assault and sexual harassment. \n",
      "\"Any act of sexual assault or sexual harassment to the children should be viewed very seriously and all such offences of sexual assault, sexual harassment on the children have to be dealt with in a stringent manner and no leniency should be shown to a person who has committed the offence under the POCSO Act,\" the Court said.\n",

      "The court referenced the objectives of the POCSO Act, which aims to protect children from sexual offences and ensure their well-being. It noted that the victim's age and the accused's position of trust as a teacher necessitated a serious approach to the allegations. The court also highlighted the potential for psychological harm to the victim and the societal implications of such crimes. Furthermore, the court expressed concern over the possibility of witness tampering, especially given the serious nature of the allegations.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, the court found that the prosecution had established a prima facie case against the applicant, leading to the rejection of the bail application. The ruling emphasized the need for strict adherence to legal protections for children and the importance of maintaining societal trust in educational institutions.\n",

      "**Summary of Legal Judgment:**\n",
      "\n",
      "In the case concerning the application for regular bail filed under Section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the applicant sought bail in connection with FIR C.R. No. 11186001220465 of 2022, registered at Girgadhda Police Station for offences under Section 354A of the IPC and Sections 10 and 18 of the POCSO Act. The applicant, represented by Mr. A.J. Yagnik, claimed innocence, arguing that the allegations were false, delayed by 13 days, and aimed at extorting money. He contended that the police lacked substantial evidence, as no medical evidence or physical evidence was collected.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prosecution, represented by Ms. C.M. Shah, opposed the bail, asserting sufficient evidence against the applicant, emphasizing the gravity of the alleged offences. The court noted the serious nature of the allegations, which involved the applicant, a teacher, allegedly molesting a 12-year-old student during school hours. The court highlighted the importance of protecting children from sexual offences, referencing the POCSO Act's objectives to safeguard minors and ensure their well-being.\n",
      "\n",
      "The court also referred to the Supreme Court's guidelines for bail consideration, which include assessing the gravity of the accusation and the potential for the accused to abscond or influence witnesses. Despite the complainant's counsel stating that the matter was amicably settled, the court deemed such a resolution inappropriate given the severity of the crime.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, the court found a prima facie case against the applicant and rejected the bail application, emphasizing the need for stringent action against offences under the POCSO Act to uphold societal values and protect vulnerable children. The application was thus denied, and the rule was discharged.\n",

      "The Supreme Court on Tuesday directed that all States which have not implemented 'one nation one ration scheme' should do so by July 31, 2021 (In Re Problems and Miseries of Migrant Workers). \n",
      "A Bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan and MR Shah ordered that States should bring a scheme to provide dry ration to migrant workers.\n",
      "The Court also noted with disapproval the fact that the Union Ministry of Labour and Employment has not yet developed a national database of unorganised workers despite orders from the Court to that effect. \n",
      "\"When the unorganized workers are waiting for registration and are waiting to reap the benefit of various welfare schemes of the States and Centre, the apathy and lackadaisical attitude by the Ministry of Labour and Employment is unpardonable. There was urgency in the portal to be finalized and implemented looking to the pandemic and dire need of unorganized workers to receive the benefit. The attitude of Ministry of Labour and Employment in not completing the module even though directed as early as on August 21, 2018 shows that Ministry is not alive to the concern of the migrant workers and the non-action of the Ministry is strongly disapproved,\" the Court said. \n",
      "It, therefore, directed the Central government to develop a web portal in consultation with National Informatics Centre to register unorganized and migrant workers. \n",
      "The same has to be done by July 31, 2021, the Court added. \n",
      "The order was passed in a suo motu case concerning welfare of migrant workers amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
      "The following directions were passed by the Court:\n",
      "- All state governments to formulate schemes to provide dry rations to all migrant workers who do not possess ration cards till such time the COVID 19 pandemic is on. Central government to allocate grains to states for the schemes.\n",
      "- Community kitchens to be run by all states and continue till pandemic is on.\n",
      "- Central government to undertake exercise to re-determine the total coverage under National Food Security Act for giving ration cards. This will benefit large number of persons as more than 10 years have elapsed since the state-wise coverage was determined.\n",
      "- All states to implement one nation one ration scheme.\n",
      "- Centre and states to complete registration of all migrant workers and those in unorganised sector by December 2021.\n",
      "The judgment came after activists Harsh Mander, Anjali Bhardwaj and Jagdeep Chhokar moved an urgent application before the Supreme Court seeking directions to ensure the migrant and stranded labourers are not deprived of ration and food security and are able to travel back to their homes at nominal cost.\n",
      "During the hearings, the Court had questioned the Central government as to why the National Database of Unorganised Workers was not ready despite its orders calling for the preparation of the same.\n",
      "The Court had noted that about Rs. 417 crore had been disbursed for the making of the Database and expressed its displeasure at the snail's pace in which the work on the same was progressing.\n",
      "\"What is your project for National Database of Unorganised Workers? 417 crore has been released but not even a module is created. How much time will you take? Process has not even started,\" the court had asked.\n",
      "The applicants had contended that even though States have been imposing decentralised COVID-19 curfews and lockdowns more cautiously this year, \"they have offered little welfare support to working classes and migrants whose livelihoods are at sea once again.\"\n",
      "\"This has triggered a second exodus of migrant workers who are flocking train and bus terminals in urban centres in a bid to get back home,\" the application stated.\n",
      "The application filed in the 2020 suo motu case sought directions to the Central government to resume its scheme of providing dry rations under the Atma Nirbhar Bharat scheme to all 8 crore migrant labourers who are not covered under the National Food Security Act (NFSA) or State PDS cards and were identified under the said scheme last year.\n",
      "Solicitor General Tushar Mehta had submitted that the National Informatics Centre (NIC) has taken over the project and that it would take another three to four months to form the Database. In response, the Bench stated that it should take a shorter time since it is just a module, and that states need not be consulted at this stage.\n",
      "Senior Advocate Colin Gonsalves urged the Bench to reject the \"excuse\" by Centre since \"three years have passed and nothing has been done.\"\n",
      "\"Please don't accept the excuse. Every state has made a state-level portal. That's why states are saying there are workers but they cant be linked to the Central government portal,\" stated Gonsalves.\n",
      "Gonsalves also relied on an October 2018 order of the top court, in which it was recorded that the Centre submitted that the portal was ready and that states can begin uploading their data.\n",
      "Senior Advocate Dushyant Dave had argued that the Atmanirbhar Scheme should be extended and that the PM Garib Kalyan Yojna be also extended to migrant workers who do not possess ration cards.\n",
      "\"Majority of these migrant workers are not ration card holders. In May 13 order, it was noted despite last order of the top court there was no data still. Thus, taking 8 crore figure as sacrosanct either extend the Atmanirbhar scheme now or PM Garib Kayan be made available to them,\" submitted Dave.\n",

      "A division bench of Justices Mukta Gupta and Anish Dayal modified the trial court order that had sentenced him to death. \n",
      "The bench held that the convict, Jeevak Nagpal, would have to undergo rigorous imprisonment for life with no remission till 20 years.\n",
      "The Court commuted the death sentence on the ground that the case did not fall in the category of the ‚Äòrarest of rare cases‚Äô. The reformation of the convict was still possible in this case, the Court opined.\n",
      "‚ÄúIt is not a case where reformation of the appellant is not possible and accordingly, this Court is of the considered view that sentence of imprisonment of life with no remission till 20 years would be the appropriate sentence. The sentence of the appellant is thus modified to rigorous imprisonment for life with no remission till 20 years and to pay a fine of ‚Çπ1 lakh, in default whereof, to undergo simple imprisonment for six months for offence punishable under Section 302 IPC,‚Äù the Court ordered.\n",
      "The High Court was dealing with a reference seeking the confirmation of the death sentence awarded to Nagpal by a trial court. It was also adjudicating on an appeal filed by the convict challenging his conviction and sentence.\n",
      "Nagpal was convicted for kidnapping and murdering his 12-year-old neighbour. It was stated that Nagpal kidnapped the child on March 18, 2009, and sent messages to the child‚Äôs father demanding ransom.\n",
      "The Court was told that he eventually murdered the child using the jack handle of his car and by smothering. The body of the deceased child was then thrown in a dry drain. Nagpal was barely 21 years of age at the time of the murder.\n",
      "After considering the case, the Court rejected Nagpal‚Äôs appeal against his conviction.\n",
      "While deciding on the reference, the Court said that the evidence on record would suggest that the murder was not pre-planned as Nagpal was not armed with any weapon.\n",
