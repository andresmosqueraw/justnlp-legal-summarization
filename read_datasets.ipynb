      "Cases 74, which are as under:\n",
      "‚Äú68. A bare perusal of the aforesaid section would show that\n",
      "it can be conveniently divided into two parts. The first part\n",
      "makes it necessary that the deception by the accused of the\n",
      "person deceived, must be fraudulent or dishonest. Such\n",
      "deception must induce the person deceived to: either (a) deliver\n",
      "property to any person; or (b) consent that any person shall\n",

      "accused must by deception intentionally induce the person\n",

      "to that person in body, mind, reputation or property. Thus, it is\n",
      "evident that deception is a necessary ingredient for the offences\n",

      "or deliver property, which the complainant would not have\n",
      "parted with or delivered, but for the inducement resulting from\n",
      "deception. The explanation to the section would clearly indicate\n",
      "that there must be no dishonest concealment of facts. In other\n",

      "that there is no reference to the Stock Purchase Agreements of\n",

      "Corporation, USA, but still in the Form 23 AC of AES India Private\n",
      "Ltd, it was mentioned that it is not a subsidiary of any other company.\n",

      "Form 23 AC where inadvertent mistake was made in mentioning that\n",
      "AES Chhattisgarh Energy Private Ltd is not a subsidiary of any other\n",
      "company. According to prosecution, since this Form 23AC is digitally\n",
      "signed by Soumendra Chandra Rout, the argument is that the same\n",
      "was filed by the company through its Director. The argument of the\n",
      "accused is that the company Secretary Nesar Ahmad was having the\n",
      "digital signatures of Soumendra Chandra Rout and he had submitted\n",
      "this Form with the registrar of companies without any intimation to\n",
      "the company or any of its directors. In the opinion of this court, since\n",
      "this Form 23 AC is digitally signed by Soumendra Chandra Rout there\n",
      "is a presumption that the same was filed with the specific authority of\n",
      "Soumendra Chandra Rout. The presumption was rebuttable. The\n",
      "argument of the accused persons is that the digital signatures were\n",
      "available with their Company Secretary Nesar Ahmad and he had filed\n",
      "this form, without any information to the company. However, when\n",
      "Nesar Ahmad was in witness box, he was not given a suggestion that\n",
      "the digital signatures of Soumendra Chandra Rout were in his\n",
      "possession and he used them for filing Form 23 AC without\n",
      "information of the company or without information of the directors\n",
      "Soumendra Chandra Rout. Therefore, this court is of the opinion that\n",
      "information in the Form 23 AC that AES Chhattisgarh energy Private\n",
      "Ltd is not a subsidiary company was under the authority of\n",
      "Soumendra Chandra Rout. However, nothing turns out on that because\n",
      "this is merely a mistake and the material on record has shown that\n",
      "AES Chhattisgarh Energy Private Ltd was a subsidiary company of\n",
      "AES India Private Ltd and through that the subsidiary company of\n",
      "AES Corporation, USA. Even if the arguments of the accused persons\n",
      "are accepted that the Form 23 AC was submitted by the office of\n",
      "Nesar Ahmad, still they cannot be absolved of their responsibility in\n",
      "furnishing this wrong Form 23 AC because the directors had the\n",
      "knowledge that they have to submit Form 23 AC with the office of\n",
      "Registrar of Companies. Being the directors and shareholders of the\n",
      "company, they should have checked with the office of Nesar Ahmad,\n",
      "the documents that were submitted with the office of Registrar of\n",
      "Companies on behalf of AES Chhattisgarh Energy Private Ltd.\n",
      "However, this court has found from the evidence, documentary and\n",
      "oral, brought on record by the accused persons during their defence\n",
      "evidence that it can be satisfactorily concluded that AES Chhattisgarh\n",
      "Energy Private Ltd that was a subsidiary of AES Corporation, USA\n",
      "because the composition of board of directors of AES Chhattisgarh\n",
      "Energy Private Ltd was under the control of AES Corporation, USA.\n",
      "207. Another emphatic argument on behalf of prosecution is that\n",
      "since the provisions of section 187C of the Companies Act, 1956 were\n",
      "neither complied with by Sanjeev Kumar Aggarwal/Soumendra\n",
      "Chandra Rout nor by AES Corporation, USA nor By AES\n",
      "Chhattisgarh Energy Private Ltd shows that AES Corporation, USA\n",
      "was not the beneficial owner of shares held in the name of Sanjeev\n",
      "Kumar Aggarwal and Soumendra Chandra Rout.\n",
      "208. In the opinion of this court, the non-compliance of Section\n",
      "187 C of the Companies Act, 1956 by all the three concerned parties\n",
      "referred above can be dealt with in two ways. One, the mere presence\n",
      "of this provision in the statute shows that there would be many\n",
      "instances where a person not holding beneficial interest in shares may\n",
      "not have made a declaration to the company specifying the name and\n",
      "other particulars of the person who was holding the beneficial interest\n",
      "in the shares of the company. There would be many instances where a\n",
      "person holding beneficial interest in shares may not have made a\n",
      "declaration to the company specifying the nature of his interest,\n",
      "particulars of the person in whose name the shares stand registered in\n",
      "the books of the company. There would be many instances where a\n",
      "company may have failed to make a declaration in its register of\n",
      "members and may have failed to file a return in the prescribed form\n",
      "with the registrar with regard to such declaration. That is why the\n",
      "legislatures deemed it appropriate to incorporate Section 187 C in the\n",
      "Companies Act, 1956. It shows that the mere fact that the provisions\n",
      "of Section 187 C of the Companies Act, 1956 were not complied with,\n",
      "does not mean nobody could be holding beneficial interest in shares of\n",
      "a company for some other person. The purpose of this provision is to\n",
      "ensure the compliance by reporting by concerned parties to the\n",
      "Registrar of Companies who is the beneficial owner of shares of a\n",
      "company. This provision does not say that in case the same is not\n",
      "complied with the beneficial owner will lose the benefit of ownership\n",
      "of those shares and the person who was holding the shares for the\n",
      "benefit of some other person will become the owner of those shares. It\n",
      "does not result the transaction into a void transaction.\n",
      "209. The second view can be that Section 187 C would be\n",
      "relevant and applicable in the prosecutions for violation of Section\n",
      "187 C of the Companies Act, 1956 and not in prosecution under\n",
      "Section 420 IPC of the accused as in the case in hand.\n",
      "210. Another strongly relied upon evidence by the prosecution is\n",
      "Form 10-K (Annual Reports) of AES Corporation, USA for the year\n",
      "ending on 31.12.2006. In this Annual Report, the holding company\n",
      "i.e., AES Corporation, USA itself did not name AES Chhattisgarh\n",
      "Energy Private Ltd as one of its subsidiaries. It was only in the Form\n",
      "10-K for the year ending on 31.12.2007, AES Chhattisgarh Energy\n",
      "Private Ltd was named as one of the subsidiaries of AES Corporation,\n",
      "USA. According to prosecution, it shows that on 10.01.2007, when\n",
      "application was given by Sanjeev Kumar Aggarwal for allocation of\n",
      "coal block in favour of AES Chhattisgarh Energy Private Ltd, the said\n",
      "company was not a subsidiary of AES Corporation, USA. The\n",
      "Holding-Subsidiary relationship between these two companies came\n",
      "into existence only on 15.11.2007 when the shares of Sanjeev Kumar\n",
      "Aggarwal and Soumendra Chandra Rout were transferred in favour of\n",
      "the two Mauritius-based companies. The argument is further\n",
      "supplemented with the allegation that as per the application of AES\n",
      "Chhattisgarh Energy Private Ltd, Rs. 1.5 Crores were already invested\n",
      "in the said company and in the feedback form, it is mentioned that the\n",
      "investment is Rs. 3 crores. The case of prosecution is that despite of\n",
      "such huge investment, AES Corporation, USA had chosen not to claim\n",
      "AES Chhattisgarh Energy Private Ltd as one of its subsidiary\n",
      "companies.\n",
      "211. The two explanations of the accused in this regard are that\n",
      "the Annual Report itself mentions that the list of subsidiaries omits\n",
      "certain subsidiaries which are not significant subsidiaries. It is the\n",
      "submission of the accused that AES Chhattisgarh Energy Private Ltd\n",
      "was not a significant subsidiary for AES Corporation, USA till the\n",
      "ending of financial year on 31.12.2006 and that is why it was not\n",
      "mentioned as one of its subsidiaries. The accused have relied on\n",
      "definition of ‚Äúsignificant subsidiary‚Äù provided in the Code of Federal\n",
      "Regulations, Part 270 (k) which is as under:\n",
      "‚Äú(k) Significant subsidiary. The term ‚Äúsignificant subsidiary‚Äù\n",
      "means a subsidiary including its subsidiaries, which meets any\n",
      "of the following conditions, using amounts determined under\n",
      "U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and, if\n",
      "applicable, Section 2 (a)(41) of the Act:\n",
      "(1) Investment test: The value of the registrant‚Äôs and its\n",
      "other subsidiaries‚Äô investments in and advances to the\n",
      "tested subsidiary exceed 10% of the value of the total\n",
      "investments of the registrant and its subsidiaries\n",
      "consolidated as of the end of the most recently completed\n",
      "fiscal year; or\n",
      "(2) Income test : The absolute value of the sum of\n",
      "combined investment income from dividends, interest and\n",
      "other income, the net unrealised gains and losses on\n",
      "investments and the net change in unrealised gains and\n",
      "losses on investments from the tested subsidiary for the\n",
      "most recently completed fiscal year exceeds:\n",
      "(i) 80 percent of the absolute value of the\n",
      "change in the net assets resulting from operations of\n",
      "the registrant and its subsidiaries consolidated for\n",
      "the most recently completed fiscal year; or\n",
      "(ii) 10 percent of the absolute value of the\n",
      "change in net assets resulting from operations of the\n",
      "registrant and its subsidiaries consolidated for the\n",
      "most recently completed fiscal year and the\n",
      "investment test [paragraph (k)(1) of this section]\n",
      "condition exceeds 5 percent. However, if the\n",
      "absolute value of the change in net assets resulting\n",
      "from operations of the registrant and its subsidiaries\n",
      "consolidated is at least 10 percent lower than the\n",
      "average of the absolute value of such amounts for\n",
      "each of its last five fiscal years, then the registrant\n",
      "may compute both conditions of the income test\n",
      "using the average of the absolute value of such\n",
      "amounts for the registrant and its subsidiaries\n",
      "consolidated for each of its last five fiscal years.‚Äù\n",
      "212. It is therefore submitted that the investment of Rs. 1.5\n",
      "Crores was not meeting the investment test referred above and\n",
      "therefore AES Chhattisgarh Energy Private Ltd was not named as a\n",
      "subsidiary of AES Corporation, USA in the annual report for the year\n",
      "ending on 31.12.2006. As against proposed investment of US $ 300\n",
      "million, investment of Rs. 1.5 Crores was insignificant investment for\n",
      "AES Corporation, USA.\n",
      "213. The reasons given by the accused persons for not including\n",
      "the name of AES Chhattisgarh Energy Private Ltd as one of the\n",
      "subsidiary companies of AES Corporation USA in the annual report\n",
      "ending as on 31.12.2007 are acceptable.\n",
      "214. There is another equally serious incriminating evidence\n",
      "against the accused persons. In the Additional Attachments to Form 23\n",
      "AC, PDF 7584 , pertaining to Balance Sheet of AES Chhattisgarh\n",
      "Energy Private Ltd as at 31.03.2008, it is recorded that there is change\n",
      "in ownership of the company. These minutes are signed by Sanjeev\n",
      "Kumar Aggarwal as Managing Director and Soumendra Chandra Rout\n",
      "as director of AES Chhattisgarh Energy Private Ltd on 25.08.2008. If\n",
      "the beneficial owner of the shares of AES Chhattisgarh Energy Private\n",
      "Ltd was AES Corporation, USA and not Sanjeev Kumar Aggarwal and\n",
      "Soumendra Chandra Rout, it should not have been mentioned that\n",
      "there is a change in the ownership. However, considering the evidence\n",
      "dating from the year 2005 onwards which is noted in earlier\n",
      "paragraphs in detail and applying the test of preponderance of\n",
      "probability, this court is of the opinion that there was gross negligence\n",
      "in the way financial documents of the company AES Chhattisgarh\n",
      "Energy Private Ltd were prepared and submitted before Registrar of\n",
      "Companies. The glaring example of careless manner with which these\n",
      "documents were furnished with the Registrar of Companies is Form\n",
      "23 AC of AES India Private Ltd for the year ending on 31.03.2007\n",
      "where it was mentioned that the said company is not a subsidiary of\n",
      "any other company. This is in spite of the fact that 1122440 shares of\n",
      "the said company were held by AES Corporation, USA and 100 shares\n",
      "were held by AES India, LLC USA. Sanjeev Kumar Aggarwal has\n",
      "blamed Nesar Ahmad for mentioning in Form 23 AC that AES\n",
      "Chhattisgarh Energy Private Ltd was not a subsidiary of any other\n",
      "company. How can he explain signing of the Director‚Äôs Report for the\n",
      "year ending on 31.03.2008 where under his signatures (and not under\n",
      "his digital signatures), he mentioned that during the year there had\n",
      "been a change in the ownership of the company. Although these\n",
      "financial documents are prepared with the assistance of Company\n",
      "Secretary and Chartered Accountants, but the signatory to these\n",
      "documents should have shown some attention before signing these\n",
      "documents. On the one hand, AES Chhattisgarh Energy Private Ltd\n",
      "had its own financial documents denying that it is a subsidiary\n",
      "company of any other company and denying that it has any holding\n",
      "company and on the other hand when the prosecution during\n",
      "investigation sought the information to justify that AES, Chhattisgarh\n",
      "Energy Private Ltd was a 100% subsidiary of AES Corporation, USA\n",
      "documents were provided half-heartedly. The approach of the accused\n",
      "was of utter complacency. Shri AP Singh, learned DLA for CBI has\n",
      "rightly pointed out that when they were given an opportunity during\n",
      "investigation, the accused did not share with CBI the emails and the\n",
      "supporting documents that were exchanged through those emails.\n",
      "When any fact is especially within the knowledge of any person, the\n",
      "burden of proving that fact is upon him. These emails which are\n",
      "brought on record now during defence evidence have shown that\n",
      "Sanjeev Kumar Aggarwal was following persons in senior positions in\n",
      "AES Corporation, USA for seeking their permission to incorporate\n",
      "SPV for carrying out MOU between AES India Private Ltd and State\n",
      "of Chhattisgarh. He was seeking their permission to spend a sum of\n",
      "Rs.1,50,000/- for incorporating the said company. He initiated steps\n",
      "for incorporating the company only receiving green signal from AES\n",
      "Corporation, USA. Important documents like One Pagers that were\n",
      "deliberated upon by the Development Council of AES Corporation,\n",
      "USA since 2005 were never shared with CBI. It was never explained\n",
      "during investigation to the CBI the procedure that was being followed\n",
      "by the Development Council of AES Corporation, USA and the stages\n",
      "a project undergoes during discussions in the Development Council\n",
      "i.e., ‚Äòidea‚Äô, ‚Äòassess‚Äô, ‚Äòpursue‚Äô and ‚Äòexecute‚Äô. The examination of all the\n",
      "material available on record, including the material brought on record\n",
      "by the accused during defence evidence, now, any prudent person\n",
      "would be of the opinion that the composition of Board of Directors of\n",
      "AES Chhattisgarh Energy Private Ltd was under the control of AES\n",
      "Corporation, USA, through its subsidiary, AES India Private Ltd.\n",
      "However, it is also right that but for the defence evidence now brought\n",
      "on record and considering the self-damaging documents of AES\n",
      "Chhattisgarh Energy Private Ltd submitted with the Registrar of\n",
      "Companies any prudent person would have come to a conclusion that\n",
      "AES Chhattisgarh Energy Private Ltd was not a subsidiary of AES\n",
      "Corporation, USA. Be that as it may. The accused have suffered this\n",
      "trial for their own mistakes in furnishing incorrect information with\n",
      "the Registrar of Companies. However, during the trial, fortunately\n",
      "they have produced all the evidence available with them to show that\n",
      "AES Chhattisgarh Energy Private Ltd was a subsidiary of AES\n",
      "Corporation, USA. They have shown that Sanjeev Kumar Aggarwal\n",
      "and Soumendra Chandra Rout could not have been appointed directors\n",
      "of AES Chhattisgarh Energy Private Ltd, without the exercise of\n",
      "power in their favour by AES Corporation USA through its subsidiary,\n",
      "AES India Private Ltd. They have shown that they were nominated as\n",
      "directors of AES Chhattisgarh Energy Private Ltd as they were\n",
      "authorised by AES India Private Ltd to incorporate the company in\n",
      "question and they were also directed that they i.e., Sanjeev Kumar\n",
      "Aggarwal and Soumendra Chandra Rout shall own all the\n",
      "shareholding of the said company till FIPB clearance. Thereafter, they\n",
      "transferred their shareholding, as per earlier decisions, in favour of\n",
      "two Mauritius based companies.\n",
      "215. Having answered this point for determination in favour of\n",
      "the accused persons, the discussion on second point of determination\n",
      "i.e., whether AES Chhattisgarh Energy Private Ltd was a subsidiary of\n",
      "AES Corporation, USA according to laws of USA is only of academic\n",
      "value now. However, the same is equally important and shall be\n",
      "decided in the following paragraphs in this judgment.\n",
      "216. The second point for determination in this case is:\n",
      "‚ÄúWhether as on 10.01.2007 AES Chhattisgarh Energy Private\n",
      "Ltd was a subsidiary of AES Corporation, USA according to the\n",
      "laws of USA?‚Äù\n",
      "217. The accused persons have relied on definition of\n",
      "‚Äúsubsidiary‚Äù given in section 220 (2) of the Delaware General\n",
      "Corporation Law in their support of their arguments. The definition is:\n",

      "230. This court finds provisions of Section 4 (6) of the\n",
      "Companies Act, 1956 are clearly made out in favour of the accused\n",
      "persons. The reason for the same is that whereas in India there is\n",
      "requirement in the form of section 187 C of the Companies Act, 1956\n",
      "to report to the registrar of companies who is the beneficial owner of\n",

      "evidence which shows that the composition of the Board of Directors\n",
      "of AES Chhattisgarh Energy Private Ltd was under the control of AES\n",
      "Corporation, USA, through its subsidiary company AES India Private\n",
      "Ltd. That discussion is not required to be repeated again. So far as\n",
      "Section 4(6) of the Companies Act, 1956 is concerned, this court is of\n",
      "the opinion that the accused have shown that AES Chhattisgarh\n",
      "Energy Private Ltd was being controlled by AES Corporation, USA\n",
      "and AES Corporation, USA was the beneficial owner of the shares of\n",
      "AES Chhattisgarh Energy Private Ltd as they were held by Sanjeev\n",
      "Kumar Aggarwal and Soumendra Chandra Rout who were record\n",
      "owner of the shares for the benefit of AES Corporation, USA.\n",
      "Therefore, according to laws of USA, AES Corporation, USA was the\n",

      "India also in view of Section 4 (6) of the Companies Act, 1956.\n",

      "persons : Since this court has held that AES Chhattisgarh Energy\n",
      "Private Ltd was the hundred percent subsidiary of AES Corporation,\n",

      "Chhattisgarh Energy Pvt. Ltd. mentioned in its application that it was\n",
      "100% subsidiary of AES Corporation, USA. Both the accused are\n",
      "therefore acquitted of all the charges framed against them i.e., under\n",
      "section 420 of IPC and under section 120 B IPC and 120 B IPC read\n",

      "Announced in the open Court (ARUN BHARDWAJ)\n",

      "SUMMARY:\n",
      "A Special Court in Delhi recently acquitted AES Chhattisgarh Energy Private Limited and its founding Director Sanjeev Kumar Aggarwal in a case involving allegations of cheating and criminal conspiracy related to the allocation of the Sayang coal block in Chhattisgarh in 2007 [CBI v. AES Chhattisgarh Energy Private Limited & Anr].\n",
      "Special Judge Arun Bhardwaj of Rouse Avenue District Courts quashed the case filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), in which it was alleged that the company had misrepresented that it was a 100 percent subsidiary of AES Corporation, USA when it applied for the coal block.¬†¬†\n",
      "The Court concluded that the accused had not cheated the Ministry of Coal for the allocation of the coal block in their favour as there was no misrepresentation when AES Chhattisgarh Energy referred to its subsidiary nature in the application.\n",
      "‚ÄúBoth the accused are therefore acquitted of all the charges framed against them i.e., under section 420 of IPC and under section 120 B IPC and 120 B IPC read with 420 IPC,‚Äù the Special Judge said.\n",
      "On examination of the material on record, the Court found that AES Corporation, USA through its subsidiary AES India Private Limited was controlling the composition of the board of directors of AES Chhattisgarh Energy Private Limited.¬†¬†\n",
      "The Court considered the CBI‚Äôs evidence that the accused company itself had informed the Registrar of Companies that it was not a subsidiary company of any other holding company.¬†\n",
      "However, the Court said such an admission could be explained by looking into the Director‚Äôs report attached to the audited balance sheet which showed that AES Chhattisgarh Energy was an affiliate of AES India.\n",
      "‚ÄúWhile examining the documents submitted by Accused No. 1 company with Registrar of Companies, this Director‚Äôs Report cannot be ignored. Whereas in the Form 23AC submitted on behalf of Accused No. 1 company, it mentioned that it is not a subsidiary of any other holding company, but in the Directors Report, it was made clear that accused No. 1 company is affiliate of AES India Private Ltd and will be implementing the project in terms of memorandum of understanding with Government of Chhattisgarh,‚Äù the Court noted.\n",
      "It concluded that the Director's report had made it clear that AES Chhattisgarh Energy is an affiliate and a subsidiary of AES India Private Limited.¬†\n",
      "‚ÄúIt is obvious that it was a blatant mistake on the part of AES Chhattisgarh Energy Private Ltd to mention in its Form 23 AC that it is not a subsidiary of any holding company whereas it was subsidiary of AES Corporation, USA,‚Äù it added.¬†\n",
      "In this context, the Court opined that there was gross negligence in the way the financial documents of the company AES Chhattisgarh Energy Private Ltd were prepared and submitted before the Registrar of Companies.¬†\n",
      "Thus, the Court said the accused had suffered the trial for their own mistakes. However, it added that¬†fortunately, they (the accused) produced all evidence available with them to show that AES Chhattisgarh Energy Private Ltd was a subsidiary of AES Corporation, USA.\n",
      "The Court also rejected the CBI‚Äôs case that AES Corporation had only later started mentioning AES Chhattisgarh Energy as its subsidiary in its Annual Reports.¬†\n",
      "It accepted the explanation that the AES Corporation's Annual Report mentioned that the list of subsidiaries omits certain non-significant subsidiaries and that AES Chhattisgarh Energy was not a significant subsidiary till the end of 2006.¬†¬†\n",
      "Concluding that AES Chhattisgarh Energy was a 100 percent subsidiary of the US company, the Court said the charges against the accused were not proven.\n",
      "\"The accused are acquitted,\" it, therefore, ordered.\n",
      "Senior Advocate RS Cheema with Advocates AP Singh, Sanjay Kumar, NP Srivastava, VK Patha, Tarannum Cheema and Akshay Nagrajan represented the CBI.\n",

      "were born, who at the time of filing of the petition were stated to be 10\n",
      "years and 13 years of age. Wife contended that the dispute occurred\n",
      "because of the excessive drinking of liquor-whisky which resulted into\n",
      "severe intoxication and consequently the husband used to beat the wife\n",
      "and used to sell the entire household goods. It is stated that the brother\n",
      "of the appellant/wife used to cater the daily needs of family including\n",
      "the payment of the school fees of the children. It was also stated that\n",
      "the husband was not doing anything and because of such habit of\n",
      "consumption of liquor, the condition of the entire family deteriorated\n",

      "the wife. It was further stated that on 26/05/2016 she was assaulted and\n",
      "abused under intoxicated state by the husband as such she was forced to\n",
      "live along with her two children at her parental home.\n",
      "4.It was further stated that initially an application seeking divorce was\n",
      "filed on similar grounds and during such proceeding, the husband\n",
      "promised that he would leave the drinking habit and would mend his\n",
      "behaviour and will not torture the appellant/wife. On such promise\n",
      "made by the husband, the earlier proceedings for seeking divorce was\n",
      "withdrawn by the wife. After sometime of the withdrawal of the earlier\n",
      "divorce petition, again the behaviour of the husband aggravated to cause\n",
      "torture and after consumption of liquor, he used to abuse and assault the\n",
      "wife and children. The wife further contended that when she demanded\n",
      "educational fees of the children, the husband refused to pay the same\n",
      "instead assaulted and abused the wife. Such incident was reported to\n",
      "the police and after preliminary enquiry, the parties arrived at a\n",

      "husband mend his way but that did not improve eventually the\n",
      "application for divorce was filed for second time.\n",
      "5.The husband did not enter his appearance instead sent a written\n",
      "statement and denied the plaint allegations. He stated that because of\n",
      "the behaviour of wife he was constrained to stay apart and the wife used\n",

      "stated that the husband wanted to restore the marriage but because of\n",
      "the behaviour of the wife it all went in vain. The husband also\n",
      "contended that he was assaulted by the wife as such he also made a\n",
      "report to the police, therefore, the cruelty was done by the wife instead\n",
      "of the husband and, therefore, she is not entitled for a decree of divorce.\n",

      "The Chhattisgarh High Court recently observed that if a husband indulges in excessive drinking of alcohol instead of discharging his duties, it would amount to mental cruelty to his wife and family, including his children¬†[Payal Sharma vs Umesh Sharma].\n",

      "The Court observed that many of the allegations of cruelty by the husband arose because of his allegedly excessive drinking habits. \n",
      "The Court was told that after consuming liquor and while in an intoxicated state, the husband used to abuse and assault his wife. It was further submitted that the condition got aggravated to the point where he even sold household goods to buy alcohol.¬†\n",
      "The bench further noted that while the couple had two children, the husband never paid their school fees. When the wife asked for money to pay these fees or for other household goods, he is alleged to have abused and assaulted her.\n",
      "Since the husband did not cross-examine the wife on these allegations during family court proceedings, the High Court deemed that these allegations were accepted. \n",
      "The Court remarked that it could, therefore, be safely stated that the husband was mentally cruel to his wife. \n",
      "\"The conduct of the wife would show that she tried to save the marriage as otherwise in the earlier occasion the application seeking divorce on the similar ground of excessive drinking would not have been withdrawn on the promise of the husband that he would mend his behaviour,\"¬†the bench further opined.\n",

      "The Supreme Court on Monday granted bail to Sadanand Kadam, an aide of Shiv Sena (UBT) MLC Anil Parab in the Dapoli resort money laundering case. [Sadanand Gangaram Kadam v Directorate of Enforcement and Anr]\n",
      "A bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan noted Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Suryaprakash V Raju's fair stand of leaving it to the Court to decide the prayer for bail.\n",
      "Even otherwise, the Court found that Kadam was entitled to bail in accordance with Section 45(1)(ii) of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) on appropriate terms and conditions, till the disposal of the complaint case filed by the Enforcement Directorate.\n",
      "In view of the ASG's stand, the Court did not record reasons in its order and directed that Kadam be produced before the Special Court within a week for being released on bail on appropriate terms and conditions.\n",
      "In March 2022, the income tax (IT) department had raided premises in several districts of Maharashtra linked to a regional transport officer who was allegedly close to Parab.\n",
      "During such raids, the investigators claimed that they discovered irregularities relating to the purchase of a¬†land in Dapoli in 2017.¬†\n",
      "The plot of land which was owned by Parab was purchased by Sadanand Kadam in May 2017 who then built a resort on the property.\n",
      "The department alleged that ‚Çπ6 crores was spent on developing on the resort and it was sold in 2020 for just for ‚Çπ11 crores.¬†\n",
      "The cost of building the resort had not been accounted for by both Kadam and Parab, it had said.\n",
      "Subsequently, ED registered an ECIR for money laundering following which it raided seven premises linked to Parab and his alleged close aides.\n",
      "The ED alleged that Parab purchased the land for consideration of¬†‚Çπ1.80 crore out of which an amount of¬†‚Çπ80 lakh was paid in cash and the cash was handed over to the seller by Kadam on behalf of Parab.\n",
      "The agency also contended that the value of the land is around¬†‚Çπ2.74 crore and the resort on the land was valued at¬†‚Çπ7.46 crore, generated through criminal activities.¬†\n",
      "Consequently, Kadam was arrested on March 10, 2023.\n",
