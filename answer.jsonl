{"ID": "id_100", "Summary": "In the present Public Interest Litigation (PIL), the petitioners, representing Hindu migrants from Pakistan residing in Adarsh Nagar near Majlis Park Metro Station, seek relief regarding their access to electricity. These migrants, who hold Aadhar Cards and long-term visas issued by the Government of India, live in makeshift shelters (Jhuggis) and lack permanent housing. The PIL highlights that local authorities are demanding proof of land ownership, which the petitioners argue is not required under Rule 9(1) of the Electricity (Rights of Consumer) Rules, 2020, as occupants can apply for electricity connections without ownership proof.\n\nThe migrants have approached Tata Power Delhi Distribution Limited (TPDDL) for electricity supply but have been informed that a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the land-owning agency is necessary for the installation of electricity poles. The land in question is owned by the Government of India, specifically the Defence Department and DMRC. The absence of an NOC has hindered the provision of electricity, leaving these families, including small children and women, in dire living conditions without electricity for the past five to six years.\n\nThe Court has granted the Union of India two weeks to file an affidavit explaining the delay in issuing the NOC to the migrants. The petitioners have assured the Court that they do not claim any rights over the land and are willing to pay for the electricity, suggesting the installation of a prepaid meter. They also noted that other migrants in similar situations in Majnu Ka Tila have received electricity connections.\n\nThe Court expressed hope that the Government of India will address the migrants' plight with compassion and file a comprehensive affidavit within the stipulated timeframe."}
{"ID": "id_1010", "Summary": "**Legal Summary of Banwari Lal Kanchhal vs. State of U.P.**\n\n**Judgment Overview:**\nThe judgment in the case of Banwari Lal Kanchhal vs. State of U.P. was reserved on November 17, 2023, and delivered on November 28, 2023. The applicant, Banwari Lal Kanchhal, represented by counsel Amit Jaiswal, Ojus Law, Ambrish Singh Yadav, and Nadeem Murtaza, challenged his conviction under Sections 332 and 506 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) by the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Lucknow, which resulted in a two-year simple imprisonment sentence and fines totaling Rs. 5,000.\n\n**Factual Background:**\nThe case originated from a First Information Report (FIR) lodged on October 6, 1991, by a Sales Tax Officer alleging that Kanchhal and several unnamed individuals assaulted him in his office, threatening him against performing his duties. The FIR indicated a history of intimidation towards other Sales Tax Officers by the accused. Following the FIR, a charge-sheet was filed solely against Kanchhal, leading to his conviction on February 23, 2023.\n\n**Procedural History:**\nKanchhal filed Criminal Appeal No. 46 of 2023 in the Sessions Court, seeking a stay on his conviction and sentence during the appeal process. The Sessions Court admitted the appeal and suspended the execution of the sentence, contingent upon the deposit of the penalty amount. However, Kanchhal later sought a modification of the order to include a stay on his conviction, which was denied on August 28, 2023.\n\nIn response, Kanchhal approached the High Court under Section 389(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) to stay the conviction, arguing that his life membership in an educational society was at risk due to the conviction, which he claimed did not involve moral turpitude.\n\n**Arguments:**\nKanchhal's counsel argued that the conviction would lead to irreparable harm, including the loss of his life membership in the society, which would adversely affect educational operations and the livelihoods of many. The State, represented by the Government Advocate, countered that the applicant's conviction was valid and that the membership termination was already enacted.\n\n**Court's Analysis:**\nThe High Court examined the merits of the case, noting that the evidence presented during the trial was insufficient to support the conviction. Key witnesses did not corroborate the informant's claims, and the medical examination revealed no injuries. The Court highlighted that the trial court's reliance on the informant's testimony was flawed, as it lacked supporting evidence from other witnesses.\n\nThe Court also addressed the legal principles surrounding the stay of conviction, emphasizing that such relief could be granted in exceptional circumstances, particularly when the conviction leads to significant consequences, such as disqualification from public life.\n\n**Decision:**\nThe High Court allowed Kanchhal's application under Section 389(2) Cr.P.C., staying the order of conviction dated February 23, 2023, pending the outcome of the appeal. The Court underscored the importance of ensuring that the applicant's rights were protected while acknowledging the potential for irreparable harm due to the conviction.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe High Court's ruling reflects a careful consideration of the evidentiary shortcomings in the original conviction and the broader implications of the applicant's legal status. The decision to stay the conviction underscores the judiciary's commitment to safeguarding individual rights while balancing the interests of justice."}
{"ID": "id_1019", "Summary": "In the case of Indian Performing Right Society Limited (IPRS) vs. Rajasthan Patrika Pvt. Ltd. and Music Broadcast Limited, the IPRS sought interim reliefs against the defendants, asserting that amendments to the Copyright Act, 1957, effective from June 21, 2012, significantly altered the legal landscape regarding the rights of authors of original works. The IPRS, a society representing authors, composers, and publishers, argued that these amendments entitled authors to claim royalties whenever their works were utilized, particularly in the context of FM radio broadcasts operated by the defendants.\n\nThe defendants contended that the amendments were merely clarificatory and did not confer any new substantive rights to authors, as the core provisions of the Copyright Act, specifically Sections 13 and 14, remained unchanged. They maintained that the established legal position, as interpreted by the Supreme Court in the 1977 case of IPRS vs. Eastern Indian Motion Pictures Association, continued to apply, which held that once authors assigned their rights to producers, they could not claim further rights.\n\nThe court examined the historical context of the amendments, noting that the Standing Committee of Parliament had recognized the need for reform to protect authors' rights, which had been inadequately addressed in previous legal interpretations. The amendments introduced new provisions that aimed to ensure authors received royalties for the commercial exploitation of their works, particularly when incorporated into cinematograph films or sound recordings.\n\nThe court found that the amendments did indeed create a substantive change in the law, allowing authors to claim royalties for the utilization of their works, even when incorporated into sound recordings. It emphasized that the exclusive rights of the defendants to communicate sound recordings to the public were now subject to the rights of authors to receive royalties, as established by the new provisions.\n\nConsequently, the court granted interim reliefs to the IPRS, restraining the defendants from publicly performing or communicating the IPRS's repertoire without paying the requisite royalties. The defendants were also ordered to announce the names of the authors and principal performers during broadcasts, in compliance with the Copyright Act.\n\nIn summary, the court recognized the significant impact of the 2012 amendments to the Copyright Act, affirming the rights of authors to claim royalties and thereby altering the legal framework governing copyright in India. The interim reliefs were granted to protect the interests of authors represented by the IPRS during the ongoing litigation."}
{"ID": "id_1024", "Summary": "**Legal Summary of Writ Petition (C) No. 493 of 2022 and Related Cases**\n\n**Parties Involved:**\n- **Petitioner:** Subhash Desai\n- **Respondents:** Principal Secretary, Governor of Maharashtra & Others\n- **Related Writ Petitions:** Nos. 469, 468, 470, 479, and 538 of 2022\n\n**Background:**\nThe case arises from a political crisis in Maharashtra, where a coalition government led by the Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), and Indian National Congress (INC) was formed under Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray. In mid-2022, internal dissent within the Shiv Sena led to a split, with a faction led by Eknath Shinde claiming to represent the \"real\" Shiv Sena. This faction allied with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to form a new government.\n\n**Key Facts:**\n1. The Shiv Sena was founded in 1966 and recognized as a political party by the Election Commission of India.\n2. Uddhav Thackeray was elected as the Party President in January 2018.\n3. The 2019 Maharashtra Legislative Assembly elections resulted in a coalition government known as the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA).\n4. In June 2022, dissenting MLAs led by Eknath Shinde met with BJP leaders, leading to a fracture within the Shiv Sena.\n5. On June 21, 2022, two factions of the Shiv Sena emerged, each claiming leadership and issuing conflicting resolutions regarding party leadership and whips.\n6. The Deputy Speaker recognized Ajay Choudhari as the Leader of the Shiv Sena Legislature Party, while Shinde's faction reaffirmed his leadership.\n7. Disqualification petitions were filed against Shinde and other MLAs, leading to a series of legal challenges.\n\n**Legal Issues:**\n1. **Disqualification Proceedings:** The court examined whether the Speaker could adjudicate disqualification petitions while a notice for their removal was pending.\n2. **Governor's Discretion:** The legality of the Governor's decision to call for a floor test and invite Shinde to form the government was scrutinized.\n3. **Appointment of Whip and Leader:** The court assessed whether the Whip and Leader of the legislature party should be appointed by the political party or the legislature party.\n4. **Impact of Deletion of Paragraph 3:** The implications of the removal of the \"split\" defense from the Tenth Schedule were considered.\n\n**Court's Findings:**\n1. The decision in **Nabam Rebia** regarding the Speaker's ability to adjudicate disqualification petitions while facing a removal notice was referred to a larger bench for clarification.\n2. The court ruled that the Speaker must decide disqualification petitions within a reasonable timeframe and that the validity of House proceedings is not contingent upon the outcome of such petitions.\n3. The court concluded that the political party, not the legislature party, appoints the Whip and Leader, emphasizing the importance of adherence to party constitutions.\n4. The deletion of Paragraph 3 from the Tenth Schedule means that the defense of a split is no longer available to members facing disqualification.\n5. The Governor's decision to call for a floor test was deemed unjustified due to a lack of objective material indicating a loss of confidence in the government, but the court could not restore the status quo ante as Thackeray resigned before the floor test.\n6. The Governor's invitation to Shinde to form the government was upheld as justified based on the support he received from a majority of MLAs.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe court disposed of the writ petitions, affirming the need for the Speaker to adjudicate disqualification petitions and clarifying the roles of the Governor, Speaker, and political parties in the context of Maharashtra's political landscape. The ruling emphasized the importance of constitutional processes in maintaining democratic governance."}
{"ID": "id_1029", "Summary": "In the case of Rajat Bajpai v. State of U.P. and Others, the petitioner, Rajat Bajpai, sought judicial intervention following an incident involving police personnel that resulted in injuries he sustained during police custody. The court, presided over by Hon'ble Justices Sangeeta Chandra and Narendra Kumar Johari, addressed several key issues arising from the events of July 27, 2023, when the petitioner was allegedly involved in a confrontation with police officers regarding the parking of his motorcycle.\n\nInitially, the court ordered a medical examination of the petitioner by a specialist at King George's Medical University (KGMU) after expressing skepticism about the nature of his injuries, which were described as abrasions and contusions. A subsequent medical report confirmed that the injuries were consistent with physical assault. The court noted that the Commissioner of Police had initiated an inquiry into the incident, which included statements from various police personnel who claimed that the petitioner had misbehaved and obstructed traffic.\n\nThe inquiry revealed conflicting accounts, with police officers asserting that the petitioner had thrown his motorcycle keys and sat on the road, while the petitioner alleged that he was assaulted by officers in plain clothes. Notably, two constables, Vishal Singh and Rahul, were identified as being present in civilian attire during the incident but could not adequately explain their actions. The court expressed dissatisfaction with the inquiry's findings, particularly regarding the lack of accountability for the alleged custodial violence.\n\nThe court highlighted the absence of functioning CCTV cameras at the police station, which raised concerns about transparency and accountability in police conduct. It emphasized the need for a thorough investigation into the actions of all involved police personnel, particularly those accused of using excessive force.\n\nThe petitioner sought several remedies, including the establishment of a medical board to assess his injuries and a high-level inquiry into the police conduct. While the court found the request for a medical board unnecessary due to existing medical reports, it acknowledged the need for further investigation into the police's actions. The court directed the Commissioner of Police to take appropriate disciplinary measures against the implicated officers and to ensure that CCTV systems were operational to prevent future incidents.\n\nThe case was scheduled for further proceedings on September 20, 2023, with the expectation that the state would provide a detailed counter affidavit and address the issues raised regarding police accountability and the functioning of surveillance systems. The court also instructed the petitioner to formally include the accused constables in the proceedings to ensure comprehensive adjudication of the matter."}

This situation necessitates the Collegium's prompt action to enhance the judge strength to address the backlog of cases and manage the influx of new matters. \n\nThe Collegium engaged in deliberations regarding the eligibility of Chief Justices and senior puisne judges from various High Courts for appointment to the Supreme Court. Prior to these discussions, judgments authored by the candidates under consideration were circulated among Collegium members to facilitate a thorough evaluation of their judicial capabilities. Additionally, the Centre for Research & Planning of the Supreme Court provided a compilation of pertinent background information to aid the Collegium's decision-making process.\n\nIn making its recommendations, the Collegium considered several critical factors: the seniority of the judges in their respective High Courts, their merit, performance, and integrity, as well as the imperative of ensuring diversity and inclusion within the Supreme Court. This included representation from underrepresented High Courts, the appointment of individuals from marginalized and backward communities, gender diversity, and minority representation.\n\nAfter a comprehensive assessment of the qualifications and competencies of the eligible candidates, the Collegium unanimously resolved to recommend the appointments of Mr. Justice Ujjal Bhuyan, currently the Chief Justice of the High Court for the State of Telangana, and Mr. Justice S. Venkatanarayana Bhatti, the Chief Justice of the High Court of Kerala. \n\nJustice Ujjal Bhuyan, who was appointed to the Gauhati High Court on October 17, 2011, has extensive experience across various legal domains, particularly in taxation law, and has earned a reputation for integrity and competence. Justice S. Venkatanarayana Bhatti, appointed to the High Court of Andhra Pradesh on April 12, 2013, and later transferred to Kerala, also possesses significant legal experience and has authored numerous judgments across diverse legal issues. His appointment is particularly significant as it restores representation for the High Court of Andhra Pradesh in the Supreme Court.\n\nThe Collegium recommends that these appointments be made in accordance with the established order of seniority, thereby addressing the current vacancies and enhancing the judicial capacity of the Supreme Court."}

The petitioner, Md Sameer Rao, sought to change his name from \"Shahnawaz\" to \"Md Sameer Rao\" following a public notification in the Gazette of India and a local newspaper. The application was denied on the grounds of delay and alleged non-compliance with statutory provisions.\n\n**Facts:**\nThe petitioner’s name was recorded as \"Shahnawaz\" in his High School and Intermediate certificates issued in 2013 and 2015. He published a notification announcing his name change in September 2020 and subsequently applied to the Board for the change, which was rejected by an order dated December 24, 2020.\n\n**Submissions:**\n- **Petitioner’s Counsel:** Argued that the rejection was arbitrary, infringing upon the fundamental rights under Articles 19(1)(a) and 21 of the Constitution. The counsel contended that the authority misapplied the limitation provisions and that the right to change one’s name is a fundamental aspect of personal identity.\n- **Respondent’s Counsel:** Asserted that the right to change a name is not absolute and is subject to reasonable restrictions. They maintained that the application was rightly rejected due to the limitation period and cited provisions that prohibit name changes that disclose religion or caste.\n\n**Legal Reasoning:**\nThe court examined the constitutional significance of a name, emphasizing its role in personal identity and dignity. It referenced various judgments affirming the right to a name as part of the right to life and liberty under Article 21, and the freedom of expression under Article 19(1)(a). The court found that the restrictions imposed by Regulation 40 of the Uttar Pradesh Intermediate Education Act, 1921, were disproportionate and arbitrary, failing to meet the standards of reasonableness required for limitations on fundamental rights.\n\n**Conclusions and Directions:**\nThe court concluded that the rejection of the petitioner’s application was unlawful and violated his fundamental rights. It set aside the impugned order and directed the respondents to allow the name change, issuing new certificates reflecting the change. The petitioner was instructed to surrender all identity documents for reissuance under his new name, ensuring consistency across all official records.\n\n**Final Ruling:**\nThe writ petition was allowed, and the court mandated the authorities to facilitate the name change in accordance with the law, emphasizing the importance of congruence in identity documents for public interest and national security. The case highlights the judicial recognition of the fundamental right to a name and the necessity for legal frameworks to adapt to individual identity changes."}
{"ID": "id_1046", "Summary": "In the case of W.P.(MD).No.17006 of 2020, the petitioner, S. Venkatesan, sought a Writ of Mandamus under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, directing the respondents—various officials of the Government of India—to ensure that all communications between the Union of India and the State of Tamil Nadu, as well as its citizens and Members of Parliament, be conducted exclusively in English. The petitioner argued that the use of Hindi in official communications violated the provisions of the Official Languages Act, 1963, particularly for states that have not adopted Hindi as their official language.\n\nThe petitioner highlighted the linguistic diversity of India, emphasizing the need to respect and protect the identities of its citizens, including their languages. He pointed out that Tamil, a language with a rich historical legacy, should be recognized and preserved, and that the Central Government's inadvertent use of Hindi in responses to Tamil Nadu's representatives was contrary to established legal provisions.\n\nThe respondents acknowledged the provisions of the Official Languages Act but claimed that the use of Hindi in the specific instance was unintentional, and they provided an English version of the communication shortly thereafter. The Assistant Solicitor General of India contended that the Central Government adheres to the Official Languages Act and that communications are generally made in English with states that do not recognize Hindi.\n\nThe court examined the relevant legal framework, including the Official Languages Act and Article 345 of the Constitution, which allows states to adopt their official languages. It noted that Tamil Nadu has adopted Tamil and English, and thus, the Central Government is obligated to communicate in English with Tamil Nadu. The court emphasized the importance of linguistic sensitivity, especially given the historical context of language-related tensions in Tamil Nadu.\n\nUltimately, the court ruled in favor of the petitioner, directing the Union Government and its officials to comply with the provisions of the Official Languages Act, ensuring that future communications with Tamil Nadu are conducted in English. The court's decision underscored the significance of linguistic rights and the need for the government to respect the diverse linguistic landscape of India. The writ petition was allowed, and no costs were imposed."}
{"ID": "id_1064", "Summary": "In the case of **Ravinder Nath Pandey vs. Dr. Y. K. Sarin & State (Cr Rev 226/2021)**, the petitioner, Dr. Y. K. Sarin, challenged the order dated 28.10.2021 issued by the learned Metropolitan Magistrate, Sh. Rishabh Kapoor, which directed the registration of an FIR against him based on a complaint filed by Ravinder Nath Dubey under Section 156(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC). The complaint alleged medical negligence concerning the treatment of Dubey's son, who underwent various medical procedures at LNJP Hospital, culminating in the removal of his left kidney on 02.08.2005.\n\nThe complainant contended that the petitioner failed to provide adequate treatment, concealed critical information regarding his son's health, and performed the nephrectomy without proper consent. He further alleged that the petitioner fabricated medical records and that a piece of kidney tube was left inside his son, leading to complications. In response, the petitioner argued that multiple inquiries conducted by the Delhi Medical Council and the National Human Rights Commission found no evidence of negligence, asserting that he acted within the standard medical protocols and had obtained informed consent for the procedures performed.\n\nThe court examined the legal framework surrounding medical negligence, referencing landmark judgments such as **Jacob Mathew vs. State of Punjab** and **Martin F. D'Souza vs. Mohd. Ishfaq**, which stipulate that a prima facie medical opinion from a competent doctor is necessary before proceeding with criminal charges against medical professionals. The court noted that the inquiries conducted had concluded that no negligence was attributable to the petitioner, and thus, the learned Trial Court's order to register an FIR was not supported by sufficient evidence.\n\nUltimately, the court found that the allegations did not meet the threshold for culpable negligence, characterizing the issues raised as potentially civil in nature rather than criminal. Consequently, the revision petition was allowed, and the order directing the registration of the FIR was set aside, reaffirming the necessity of expert medical opinion in cases alleging medical negligence. The trial court record was ordered to be returned for proper consignment."}
{"ID": "id_1066", "Summary": "**Legal Summary:**\n\nIn the case at hand, the petitioner, a 2010 Batch officer of the Indian Revenue Service (IRS), challenges the jurisdiction of the Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) constituted under the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 (SHW Act). The petitioner contends that the SHW Act only applies when the alleged harassment occurs between employees within the same department, arguing that a woman employee cannot invoke the Act if harassed by an employee from another department.\n\nThe proceedings stem from a complaint filed by an officer in the Department of Food and Public Distribution against the petitioner, alleging sexual harassment. Upon receiving a notice from the ICC to appear for a hearing, the petitioner instead filed a writ petition before the Central Administrative Tribunal, questioning the ICC's jurisdiction. The Tribunal dismissed the petitioner's challenge, leading to the current writ petition.\n\nThe petitioner’s counsel, Mr. Arun Bhardwaj, highlighted specific definitions and sections of the SHW Act, asserting that the ICC of one department lacks the authority to investigate complaints against employees from another department. He argued that the employer, as defined in the Act, does not have disciplinary control over the petitioner, rendering any findings by the ICC unenforceable.\n\nThe Court, however, emphasized the need for a purposive interpretation of the SHW Act, which aims to provide a safe working environment for women and protect their rights to equality and dignity. The Court noted that the definitions of \"employee\" and \"workplace\" within the Act do not restrict the ICC's jurisdiction solely to cases involving employees of the same department. It concluded that the ICC could issue notices and conduct inquiries into complaints of sexual harassment, regardless of the departments involved, as long as the respondent qualifies as an employee under the Act.\n\nThe Court further clarified that the SHW Act's provisions must be interpreted in a manner that does not undermine its objectives, which include ensuring a secure work environment for women and preventing gender-specific violence. The Court dismissed the writ petition, allowing the ICC to proceed with its inquiry into the complaint, while also granting the petitioner the opportunity to request additional time for his appearance before the ICC.\n\nIn conclusion, the Court upheld the Tribunal's decision, affirming that the ICC has the jurisdiction to investigate complaints of sexual harassment involving employees from different departments under the SHW Act. The hearing before the ICC was scheduled to continue as planned, with the petitioner permitted to seek further time if necessary."}

The Supreme Court granted leave and allowed applications for impleadment.\n\nThe Selection Committee had initially set cut-off marks based on a total of 300 marks, with specific percentages for different categories: 60% for General, 57% for Socially and Educationally Backward Classes, and 55% for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. The advertisement issued on September 5, 2015, clearly outlined horizontal reservations for women, ex-servicemen, and physically handicapped candidates, stating that unfilled reserved posts would be filled by eligible candidates from the respective categories.\n\nHowever, in subsequent meetings, the Selection Committee proposed to relax the cut-off marks for candidates in horizontal reserved categories, which was later cancelled. The State Government decided to implement special reservations despite their horizontal nature, leading to a unilateral reduction of cut-off marks post-result declaration, which the appellants argued was arbitrary and against established legal principles.\n\nThe High Court initially ruled in favor of the appellants, but the Division Bench later allowed appeals from private respondents who benefited from the Selection Committee's decision, asserting that the appellants did not have a vested right to the posts and that the Selection Committee had adequate power to make such changes.\n\nThe Supreme Court, while acknowledging the laudable objective behind the State's decision to accommodate special categories, emphasized that the Selection Committee's power to modify selection criteria post-examination was not absolute and must adhere to the principles of fairness and legality. The Court referenced previous judgments that established candidates' rights to be considered based on the rules in place at the time of application.\n\nUltimately, the Supreme Court set aside the Division Bench's order, ruling that the reduction of cut-off marks was arbitrary and unjustified. However, to balance equities, the Court directed the State to consider accommodating the private respondents within their respective reserved categories without affecting the appointments of the appellants and others similarly situated. The appeals were allowed, with no order as to costs, ensuring that the rights of the appellants were preserved while also addressing the concerns of the private respondents."}

The allegations stemmed from an incident on September 17, 2016, when the complainant, the wife of Nagappa, along with her family, was allegedly assaulted and prevented from entering the Gadi Chowdeshwari Temple by the petitioners, who hurled caste-based abuses at them.\n\nFollowing the incident, the complainant filed a police report on September 18, 2016, leading to an investigation and the filing of a charge sheet against the petitioners. The petitioners subsequently filed an application under Section 227 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) for discharge, which was denied by the II Additional District and Sessions Judge on January 10, 2022. This denial prompted the petitioners to approach the High Court.\n\nDuring the hearings, the petitioners' counsel argued that the allegations did not meet the necessary legal criteria for the offences under the Act, claiming that the incident did not occur in a public place as required by the law. They contended that the charges were based on an outdated provision of the Act, which had been amended. Conversely, the prosecution maintained that the petitioners' actions constituted clear violations of the Act, emphasizing that the incident occurred in a public space and involved serious allegations of physical assault and caste-based discrimination.\n\nThe court examined the facts, noting that the petitioners and the complainant belonged to the same village and that the temple was a public place where the complainant and her family were denied entry based on their caste. The court found that the ingredients of the offences under the Act were satisfied, as the petitioners had intentionally insulted and humiliated the complainant and her family in public view.\n\nThe court also addressed the broader societal implications of caste discrimination, highlighting the persistence of untouchability despite constitutional prohibitions. It emphasized the need for equality in worship and condemned the discriminatory actions of the petitioners.\n\nUltimately, the court rejected the petitioners' application, affirming that the case had sufficient merit to proceed to trial. It ordered that the trial be expedited, to be completed within six months, while clarifying that the observations made were solely for the purpose of this petition and would not influence future proceedings."}

The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) stayed the termination of the PPA, which was subsequently upheld by the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT).\n\n**Key Facts:**\n1. The PPA was established on 30 April 2010, obligating the Corporate Debtor to supply electricity to GUVNL for 25 years.\n2. The Corporate Debtor faced operational challenges due to floods in 2015 and 2017, leading to financial stress and eventual declaration as a non-performing asset (NPA) by its lenders.\n3. The Corporate Debtor initiated the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) on 20 November 2018, which was admitted by the NCLT.\n4.

The Supreme Court upheld the jurisdiction of the NCLT/NCLAT under Section 60(5)(c) of the IBC to stay the termination of the PPA, emphasizing that the termination would lead to the corporate death of the Corporate Debtor, which is contrary to the objectives of the IBC.\n2. The Court noted that the PPA was critical for the Corporate Debtor's survival as it was its sole contract for electricity supply.\n3. The broader question of the validity of ipso facto clauses was left open for legislative intervention, acknowledging the need for clarity in the law regarding such clauses in the context of insolvency.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe appeal by GUVNL was dismissed, affirming the NCLT's and NCLAT's decisions to restrain the termination of the PPA, thereby preserving the Corporate Debtor's status as a going concern during the insolvency resolution process.

{"ID": "id_1131", "Summary": "In the case of Arun versus the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) and others, the Court addressed a review petition filed by the MCGM seeking to challenge its previous order dated 17th September 2019. The petition was presented by Mr. Girish Godbole and Sagar Patil for the petitioners, while Ms. Niyati Merchant, Yash Dhruva, and Harsh Sheth represented the respondents, Zenith Tins Private Limited and another party. The Court, presided over by Justices Gauri Godse and GS Patel, found the review petition to be a gross abuse of the court's process, particularly given that it was initiated by a municipal body.\n\nThe review petition was based on the claim that new documents, purportedly of earlier vintage, had been discovered after the initial order. Specifically, the MCGM asserted that these documents were unearthed after a thorough examination of archived records concerning over 4,700 leasehold plots, including specific plots that had been subdivided. However, the Court expressed skepticism regarding the timing and necessity of this \"sifting\" process, questioning why such an examination had not been conducted prior to the filing of the original affidavit by Sudhakar Ramkrishna Mahajan, an Assistant Engineer with the MCGM.\n\nThe Court noted that Mahajan had previously stated in his affidavit that he had reviewed all relevant records and was familiar with the case's facts. The review petition contradicted this assertion, claiming that Mahajan's statements were incorrect and that records existed which he could not have accessed. The Court highlighted a lack of clarity on how the review petition fell under the provisions of Section 114 or Order 47 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, particularly regarding the MCGM's alleged due diligence in uncovering the new material.\n\nUltimately, the Court dismissed the review petition as lacking substance and ordered the MCGM to pay costs of Rs. 2 lakhs to the original writ petitioner. Additionally, the pending interim application was also disposed of as it no longer had relevance following the dismissal of the review petition."}

{"ID": "id_114", "Summary": "On May 10, 2021, the Bar Council of India convened to address a Revision Petition filed by the High Court Bar Association of Punjab and Haryana, challenging the Bar Council of Punjab and Haryana's Order from May 7, 2021, which stayed the Association's Resolution to boycott the Court of the Hon’ble Chief Justice due to alleged irregularities in case listings and significant backlog issues. The High Court Bar Association contended that the stay was issued hastily and violated principles of natural justice.\n\nThe Bar Council of Punjab and Haryana had issued a reasoned Order, acknowledging the concerns raised by the Bar Association regarding the allocation of work among judges, where only 12 out of 49 judges were reportedly handling cases, leading to delays in urgent matters such as bail applications. The Bar Council of India, while recognizing the widespread issues faced by lawyers across various High Courts, noted the dual challenges of health risks posed by the pandemic and the livelihood concerns of legal professionals.\n\nIn response to the grievances, the Bar Council of India established a 7-Member Committee, led by Senior Advocate Mr. Ashwani Chopra, to engage with the Chief Justice of Punjab and Haryana High Court for potential resolutions. The Committee includes prominent members from the legal community, including the President and Secretary of the High Court Bar Association, and other senior advocates.\n\nDespite acknowledging the difficulties faced by the legal fraternity, the Bar Council of India declined to stay the Order of the State Bar Council and emphasized that a boycott of the Chief Justice or any High Court judge is only justifiable in exceptional circumstances. The Council deemed the demand for the Chief Justice's transfer as prima facie improper and cautioned against politicization within Bar Associations. The Bar Council expressed confidence in the Chief Justice's willingness to meet with the Committee to address the concerns raised.\n\nThe Revision Petition is scheduled for final hearing on May 14, 2021, during which the Bar Council of India will consider the Committee's recommendations before making a conclusive decision on the matter."}
{"ID": "id_1154", "Summary": "**Legal Summary of Civil Appeal No. 6805 of 2022 and Civil Appeal No. 6806 of 2022**\n\n**Parties Involved:**\n- **Appellant:** Orissa Administrative Tribunal Bar Association\n- **Respondents:** Union of India & Others\n\n**Background:**\nThis appeal arises from a judgment of the Orissa High Court dated June 7, 2021, which dismissed writ petitions challenging the abolition of the Odisha Administrative Tribunal (OAT) via a notification issued by the Union Government on August 2, 2019. The context of the case is rooted in the legislative framework established by Article 323A of the Constitution, which allows for the creation of administrative tribunals to adjudicate service-related disputes.\n\n**Key Legal Provisions:**\n- **Article 323A:** Empowers Parliament to establish administrative tribunals.\n- **Administrative Tribunals Act, 1985:** Governs the establishment and functioning of such tribunals.\n- **Section 21 of the General Clauses Act, 1897:** Allows for the rescission of notifications issued under statutory powers.\n\n**Factual Background:**\nThe OAT was established on July 4, 1986, to expedite the resolution of service matters for state employees. However, following the Supreme Court's ruling in *L. Chandra Kumar v. Union of India* (1997), which mandated that decisions of administrative tribunals could be challenged in High Courts, the State of Odisha concluded that the OAT was no longer fulfilling its intended purpose of providing speedy justice. Consequently, the State Government requested the Union Government to abolish the OAT, citing inefficiencies and increased litigation costs.\n\n**Judgment of the Orissa High Court:**\nThe High Court upheld the abolition of the OAT, reasoning that:\n1. Article 323A does not impose a mandatory obligation on the Union Government to maintain established tribunals.\n2. The decision to abolish the OAT was administrative and validly executed under Section 21 of the General Clauses Act.\n3. The notification did not violate Article 14 (right to equality) as it was based on relevant considerations, including the tribunal's performance and financial implications.\n4. The principles of natural justice were not violated, as the decision was a policy matter not requiring individual hearings.\n5. The Union Government was not functus officio after establishing the OAT, allowing it to rescind the notification.\n6. The notification's validity was not compromised by not being issued in the name of the President of India.\n\n**Arguments Presented:**\n- **Appellants' Arguments:**\n  - Article 323A mandates the establishment of SATs and does not allow for their abolition.\n  - Section 21 of the General Clauses Act cannot be invoked to abolish the OAT.\n  - The abolition violates the fundamental right of access to justice and the principles of natural justice.\n  - The State Government's failure to fill vacancies in the OAT constituted an attempt to take advantage of its own wrong.\n\n- **Respondents' Arguments:**\n  - The Union Government acted within its powers to abolish the OAT based on the State Government's request.\n  - The abolition was justified due to the inefficiency of the OAT and the additional tier of litigation created by the Supreme Court's ruling.\n  - The transfer of cases from the OAT to the Orissa High Court would not infringe upon litigants' rights.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe Supreme Court affirmed the High Court's judgment, concluding that the abolition of the OAT was constitutionally valid. The Court emphasized that the decision was based on a rational assessment of the tribunal's effectiveness and did not infringe upon the rights of litigants. The appeals were dismissed, and the notification abolishing the OAT was upheld. The Ministry of Law and Justice was directed to conduct a judicial impact assessment as previously mandated by the Court."}

No.491 of 2022 and Connected Matters**\n\n**Parties Involved:**\n- **Petitioner:** Bilkis Yakub Rasool (victim of heinous crimes during the Gujarat riots)\n- **Respondents:** State of Gujarat, Radheshyam Bhagwandas Shah, and others (convicts)\n\n**Factual Background:**\nThe writ petitions challenge the orders dated 10.08.2022, which granted remission and early release to several convicts involved in heinous crimes during the Gujarat riots of 2002, including gang rape and murder. The petitioner, Bilkis Yakub Rasool, lost her family members in these brutal attacks and seeks justice against the remission granted to the convicts.\n\n**Key Legal Issues:**\n1. **Maintainability of the Writ Petition:** The Supreme Court held that the petition filed under Article 32 of the Constitution by the victim is maintainable, emphasizing that victims have the right to seek justice and challenge unlawful actions that affect their rights.\n\n2. **Public Interest Litigation (PIL) Maintainability:** The Court noted that while the maintainability of PILs is a significant issue, it did not need to be resolved in this case since the victim's writ petition was already being considered.\n\n3. **Competence of the State of Gujarat:** The Court found that the State of Gujarat was not the appropriate government to grant remission as the trial and conviction occurred in Maharashtra. The appropriate government, as per Section 432(7) of the CrPC, is the one where the conviction took place.\n\n4. **Legality of the Remission Orders:** The Court quashed the remission orders, stating they were issued by an authority lacking jurisdiction. The orders were deemed a nullity due to the usurpation of power by the State of Gujarat, which acted contrary to the law.\n\n5. **Opinion of the Presiding Judge:** The Court emphasized that the opinion of the Presiding Judge of the convicting court must be sought before granting remission, as mandated by Section 432(2) of the CrPC. The failure to obtain this opinion rendered the remission orders invalid.\n\n6. **Non-Payment of Fine:** The Court highlighted that the convicts had not paid the imposed fines, which should have been a critical consideration in the remission process. The non-payment of fines indicates that the convicts were not entitled to remission.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe Supreme Court allowed the writ petition filed by Bilkis Yakub Rasool, quashing the remission orders dated 10.08.2022. The Court directed that the convicts must report to the concerned jail authorities within two weeks, restoring the status quo ante. The ruling underscored the importance of adhering to the rule of law, the necessity of obtaining the Presiding Judge's opinion in remission cases, and the need for a fair and just approach to the remission process, particularly in cases involving heinous crimes."}

The court expressed that any breach of Covid-19 protocols could exacerbate the situation and must be strictly prevented. In response to the situation, the Additional Solicitor General and the Standing Counsel assured the court that measures were being implemented to ensure compliance with the protocols in market areas.\n\nHowever, the court suggested that additional measures might be necessary, advocating for increased engagement from Market Associations, Street Vendor Associations, and Weekly Market Associations to ensure that vendors, their staff, and customers adhere to the mandated protocols. The court also recommended a more active presence of Civil Defence and police personnel in these areas, alongside proper sanitization of public facilities.\n\nTo ensure accountability, the court ordered that a Status Report be filed at least two days prior to the next hearing, scheduled for July 9, 2021, thereby reinforcing the need for ongoing vigilance in managing public health during the pandemic."}
{"ID": "id_1169", "Summary": "In the case arising from Special Leave Petition (C) No. 20112/2018, the Supreme Court of India addressed an appeal against the judgment and order dated November 9, 2017, issued by the Division Bench of the Madras High Court. This appeal was initiated by the defendants-appellants, challenging the High Court's decision to allow Original Suit Appeal No. 28 of 2015, which had set aside the earlier ruling of the learned Single Judge dated June 26, 2014, and decreed Suit No. 730.\n\nThe core facts of the case involve the property originally held by S. Ramdoss, who passed away in 1976, leaving behind his widow, one son, and four daughters as legal heirs. An oral partition was reportedly conducted between the heirs in 1981-1982, wherein it was agreed that the immovable property would be allocated to the son (defendant No. 1), while the mother and daughters would receive compensation in liquid assets. This arrangement was later formalized through an unregistered written deed of partition executed on August 18, 1995, followed by a registered partition deed on November 27, 2000, both signed by all heirs.\n\nIn 2010, the plaintiffs initiated legal proceedings for partition, claiming a one-sixth share each, following a breakdown in family relations. The learned Single Judge dismissed their suit, affirming the validity of the registered partition deed and rejecting the plaintiffs' claims that they were misled into signing blank documents for the purpose of obtaining an electric connection.\n\nThe Division Bench, while acknowledging that the plaintiffs were educated and had signed the documents, expressed skepticism regarding the circumstances under which they relinquished their rights to valuable property. The Bench's findings were criticized for being based on presumptions rather than concrete evidence, particularly overlooking the plaintiffs' admissions regarding their presence at the Registrar's office during the execution of the documents.\n\nThe Supreme Court found the Division Bench's judgment to be self-contradictory and lacking in consideration of relevant evidence. It emphasized that the suit could not be decreed based solely on presumptions about the value of the property. Consequently, the Court upheld the learned Single Judge's dismissal of the suit, allowing the appeal and setting aside the Division Bench's order.\n\nIn conclusion, the Supreme Court maintained the validity of the partition deeds executed by the parties and ruled in favor of the defendants, thereby reinforcing the legal principle that agreements made by competent parties should be honored unless substantiated claims of coercion or misrepresentation are proven."}

The petitioner is accused of inciting communal disharmony through a discussion show titled \"Desh Jhukne Nhi Denge,\" which was also shared on his Twitter account, allegedly leading to communal riots in Alwar on April 22, 2022.\n\nThe petitioner contends that three FIRs were filed against him: the first with Police Station Bichwada Dungarpur (FIR No. 147/2022) on April 23, 2022, the second with Police Station Sadar, Bundi (FIR No. 200/2022) on the same day, and the third with Police Station Kotwali, Alwar (FIR No. 372/2022) on April 24, 2022.

Union of India, to support his claim.\n\nThe court has issued notice to the informants and respondents, with the requirement for a response within two weeks. The learned Public Prosecutor has accepted notice on behalf of the State and will file a reply accordingly. The petitioner has requested interim protection from arrest, which the Additional Advocate General opposes, arguing that such protection is unwarranted under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code.\n\nThe court, recognizing the unsustainability of the subsequent FIRs based on the same cause of action, has determined that the petitioner does not require protection from arrest in connection with FIR No. 372/2022 and FIR No. 200/2022, and thus, he shall not be arrested in these cases until further orders are issued."}

The appellant was sentenced to five years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 3000, with an additional six months of imprisonment for non-payment.\n\nThe prosecution's case originated from a complaint by the mother of an eight-year-old victim, who reported that on May 7, 2007, Saha attempted to rape her daughter. The victim recounted that Saha lured her with ice-cream, took her to a secluded area, and attempted to remove her clothing while physically restraining her. The victim's cries attracted a crowd, leading to Saha's apprehension and subsequent hospitalization due to mob violence.\n\nFollowing the complaint, Balurghat Police Station registered a case under Section 376/511 IPC, leading to an investigation and the filing of charges against Saha, who pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe prosecution presented eight witnesses, including the victim and her mother. The defense, represented by Amicus Curiae Mr. Pritam Ray, argued that the prosecution failed to establish the necessary elements of the offense, highlighting inconsistencies in witness testimonies and the absence of a Test Identification Parade. Notably, the medical examination by PW4 revealed no signs of violence or injury on the victim, and the wearing apparel was not seized.\n\nThe court evaluated the testimonies, particularly focusing on the victim's statements recorded under Section 164 of the Criminal Procedure Code, which did not indicate any penetration. The court acknowledged the victim's credible account but noted the lack of corroborative evidence from independent witnesses.\n\nThe judgment referenced the legal definitions of rape and attempted rape under Sections 375 and 511 IPC, respectively, emphasizing the distinction between preparation and attempt. The court concluded that Saha's actions constituted an attempt to commit rape, as he lured the victim and engaged in acts that clearly indicated his intent.\n\nUltimately, the court upheld the conviction, finding no grounds for interference with the lower court's decision. The appellant's period of detention during the trial was to be deducted from the sentence as per Section 428 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The court expressed gratitude for the assistance provided by the Amicus Curiae and ordered the lower court records to be sent back for necessary actions.\n\nThis summary encapsulates the essential elements of the case, including the parties involved, the factual background, the legal arguments presented, and the court's reasoning leading to the final judgment."}
{"ID": "id_1189", "Summary": "On November 2, 2022, the High Court addressed a writ petition (WP(C)) filed by a 23-year-old MBA student seeking permission for a medical termination of her 26-week pregnancy. The petitioner, who became pregnant following a consensual relationship, was unaware of her condition until an ultrasound revealed it on October 25, 2022. She suffers from Polycystic Ovarian Disease, which contributed to her delayed realization of the pregnancy. The petitioner expressed significant mental distress, exacerbated by her partner's departure for higher studies, and argued that continuing the pregnancy would worsen her emotional state and hinder her education and future employment.\n\nDue to the pregnancy exceeding 24 weeks, hospitals were reluctant to perform the termination under the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971. The petitioner sought the court's intervention to direct the respondents to allow the procedure. The court had previously ordered the formation of a Medical Board to evaluate her case, which took place on October 28, 2022. The Board concluded that while the continuation of the pregnancy posed no immediate physical risk to the petitioner, it could severely impact her mental health, given her acute stress disorder.\n\nThe Medical Board's opinion highlighted the risks associated with the termination procedure, including potential complications for both the mother and the fetus, which was viable at 26 weeks. The court noted the importance of a woman's right to make reproductive choices as part of her personal liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution of India, referencing relevant case law that supports this right.\n\nAfter considering the Medical Board's recommendations and the petitioner's circumstances, the court issued interim directions allowing the petitioner to terminate her pregnancy at a government hospital. The hospital was instructed to form a medical team to conduct the procedure promptly, and the petitioner was required to provide an undertaking acknowledging the risks involved. The court emphasized the necessity of ensuring the best medical care for the baby if born alive.\n\nThe case underscores the balance between a woman's reproductive rights and the medical considerations surrounding late-term pregnancy terminations, reflecting the evolving legal landscape regarding women's health and autonomy in India."}
{"ID": "id_1191", "Summary": "On July 4, 2022, the court delivered a judgment regarding a petition filed by the petitioner under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, challenging an arbitral award dated June 10, 2019. The dispute arose from an agreement dated June 16, 2010. The respondent opposed the petition, asserting it was barred by limitation, as it was filed after the three-month period stipulated in Section 34(3) of the Act, which begins from the date of receipt of the arbitral award. The petitioner claimed to have received the award on June 12, 2019, making September 12, 2019, the last date for filing the petition. However, the petitioner filed the petition on September 13, 2019, one day late.\n\nThe respondent highlighted procedural deficiencies in the initial filing, including the absence of the impugned award, vakalatnama, and a signed statement of truth, rendering the initial petition non-est. Although the petitioner refiled the petition on October 24, 2019, this was beyond the condonable delay period. The court noted that the initial filing was only 73 pages and lacked essential documents, while the subsequent filing was significantly larger at 1,325 pages, indicating a substantial change in the petition's framework.\n\nThe court found merit in the respondent's argument that the October 24, 2019, filing could not be considered a continuation of the September 13, 2019, petition due to the lack of required documents in the initial submission. Citing the precedent set in Union of India v. Bharat Biotech International Ltd., the court concluded that the initial filing was invalid, thus treating the October 24, 2019, submission as the first valid filing. Consequently, the delay in filing the petition exceeded the permissible limit, leading to the dismissal of the petition as barred by limitation, along with the disposal of all pending applications."}

The petitioners contended that this rule was inconsistent with sections 34 and 35 of the Registration Act, 1908, which govern the registration process and do not require such permissions.\n\nThe background of the case involved the petitioners presenting sale deeds for registration concerning specific plots of land, which were refused by the Sub-Registrar on the grounds of non-compliance with the impugned circular. The petitioners argued that the circular and the rule exceeded the legislative competence of the respondents and conflicted with the provisions of the Registration Act, which primarily focus on the execution of documents and the identity of the parties involved.\n\nThe court examined the legal framework, emphasizing that the powers of registering authorities under the Registration Act are limited to verifying the execution of documents and the identity of the parties, without delving into the legality of the transactions themselves. The court found that Rule 44(1)(i) and the circular imposed additional requirements that were not supported by the Registration Act, rendering them ultra vires.\n\nUltimately, the court ruled in favor of the petitioners, declaring that Rule 44(1)(i) and the circular were invalid and should not be applied by the registering authorities. The court ordered that the authorities could not refuse registration based on these provisions, thereby allowing the petitioners to proceed with the registration of their sale deeds without the need for prior permissions as stipulated in the impugned circular.

The respondents, aged and without income, claimed maintenance after the death of their son, asserting that they had no one to care for them. \n\nThe petitioner contended that the respondents had four married daughters and owned 2 acres and 30 gunthas of land, along with a house, which negated their claim for maintenance. She argued that her employment in the health department was not on compassionate grounds and thus, she was not legally obligated to support her in-laws under Section 125, which does not explicitly include parents-in-law among those entitled to maintenance.\n\nThe trial court, referencing the case of Smt. Saroj W/o. Govind Mukkawar, ruled that maintenance could be claimed from a daughter-in-law, considering the respondents' senior citizen status and lack of financial support. However, the petitioner appealed, asserting that the respondents did not fall within the categories specified in Section 125, which includes only wives, children, and parents.\n\nUpon review, the court noted that the legislative intent of Section 125 is exhaustive, and parents-in-law are not included. The court also distinguished the current case from Saroj W/o. Govind Mukkawar, emphasizing that the petitioner’s employment was not secured on compassionate grounds, unlike the widow in that case. Furthermore, the court highlighted that the respondents had received a substantial sum from the deceased's employer and owned property, indicating their financial independence.\n\nUltimately, the court concluded that the respondents were not entitled to maintenance from the petitioner, as they did not meet the criteria outlined in Section 125, and their financial situation did not warrant such support. The ongoing proceedings in the lower court were deemed an abuse of process, leading to the quashing of the maintenance application.

They named the defendant-petitioner and several others as parties to the suit, alleging violations of their rights to perform rituals and worship deities within the old temple complex located at Settlement Plot No. 9130 in Varanasi.\n\nThe plaintiffs sought several specific reliefs, including declarations affirming their entitlement to perform rituals for deities such as Maa Shringar Gauri, Lord Ganesha, and Lord Hanuman, as well as injunctions against the defendants from imposing restrictions or causing damage to the deities' images. They also requested a mandatory injunction directing the Uttar Pradesh Government and District Administration to ensure security arrangements for the daily worship activities.\n\nAlongside the suit, the plaintiffs filed an application for a temporary injunction and for the appointment of an Advocate Commissioner to inspect the property and verify the existence of the deities. The suit was registered on August 18, 2021, with the Court issuing summons to the defendants and scheduling dates for the filing of written statements and issue framing. The Court granted the application for the Advocate Commissioner but denied the request for an ad interim injunction.\n\nSubsequent to the initial orders, the plaintiffs requested videography of the inspection and police assistance for the Advocate Commissioner. The defendant-petitioner objected, arguing that the commission should not be used to collect evidence and that police aid should only be provided if obstruction occurred during the commission's execution. The defendant-petitioner also challenged the appointment of the Advocate Commissioner and the orders related to the temporary injunction.\n\nThe Court, upon reviewing the arguments, emphasized that the issuance of a commission for local inspection is permissible to gather evidence that cannot be produced by the parties, particularly in cases where the existence of deities on the disputed property is in question. The Court noted that the discretion to appoint an Advocate Commissioner lies with the Court, and the plaintiffs' suggestion of a specific Commissioner does not undermine the Court's authority.\n\nUltimately, the Court found no merit in the defendant-petitioner's objections, affirming that the orders in question were procedural and did not infringe upon the rights of the parties. The petition was dismissed, and the Court ruled that there would be no order as to costs."}

The appeal was filed under Section 378 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) to challenge the trial court's decision which found the respondent not guilty of charges under Sections 420 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Section 13(2) read with 13(1)(d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988.\n\nThe prosecution's case was based on allegations that the respondent, a Court Officer, misrepresented his ability to secure a job for the complainant, Kumar, in exchange for a bribe of Rs.40,000. The complainant paid Rs.20,000 initially and later received additional payments, but the promised job was never secured. The respondent was accused of abusing his official position to obtain these amounts unlawfully. During the trial, twelve witnesses were examined, and various documents were presented, establishing the prosecution's claims.\n\nThe trial court acquitted the respondent, concluding that the prosecution failed to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. The court noted that the evidence presented did not sufficiently demonstrate that the money exchanged constituted a bribe rather than a loan, as claimed by the defense.\n\nOn appeal, the prosecution argued that the trial court overlooked critical evidence, including the testimonies of the complainant and corroborating witnesses, which indicated a clear pattern of deceit by the respondent. The defense contended that the transactions were merely loans and that the complainant should have pursued civil remedies rather than criminal charges.\n\nUpon reviewing the evidence, the appellate court found that the prosecution had indeed established its case beyond a reasonable doubt. The court emphasized that the respondent, as a public servant, was prohibited from engaging in financial transactions with private individuals without prior departmental approval. The court also noted the respondent's prior disciplinary issues related to similar allegations, reinforcing the prosecution's claims of a fraudulent scheme.\n\nConsequently, the appellate court allowed the appeal, overturned the acquittal, and convicted the respondent under both Sections 420 IPC and 13(2) read with 13(1)(d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act. The respondent was sentenced to three years of rigorous imprisonment for each offense, with fines imposed, and the sentences were ordered to run concurrently. The court directed the respondent to appear for sentencing on 20.02.2023, where he reiterated his claims of innocence and requested leniency due to health issues. However, the court found no mitigating circumstances and upheld the sentences as just.\n\nThis case underscores the legal principles surrounding corruption and the responsibilities of public servants, highlighting the judiciary's role in ensuring accountability in public office."}

The incident, as reported by the informant Smt. Kalawati, occurred on February 16, 2019, when the victim, a 13-year-old girl, was alone at home while her family was in the fields. The applicant allegedly entered the house, threatened the victim, and committed rape. The informant and her family discovered the victim in a vulnerable state upon returning home, leading to the applicant's apprehension.\n\nThe applicant's counsel argues that there was a prior romantic relationship between the applicant and the victim, suggesting that the allegations are false and motivated by a land dispute between the applicant and the informant. The counsel further claims that the applicant has no prior criminal record and poses no flight risk or threat to the judicial process.\n\nConversely, the prosecution, represented by the Additional Government Advocate, opposes the bail application, emphasizing the victim's minor status and the gravity of the charges. The prosecution highlights that the victim corroborated the allegations in her statement under section 164 of the Criminal Procedure Code and points out the applicant's criminal history, which includes six prior cases, contradicting the applicant's claims of having no criminal antecedents.\n\nThe court, after considering the arguments and the severity of the crime, notes the applicant's failure to disclose his criminal history and the lack of evidence supporting claims of a land dispute. The court underscores the heinous nature of the crime against a minor, referencing relevant Supreme Court judgments that stress the importance of judicial discretion in bail matters, particularly for habitual offenders. The court expresses concern over the psychological impact of such crimes on victims and the necessity for a robust judicial response to deter such offenses.\n\nUltimately, the court denies the bail application, asserting that the circumstances do not warrant the applicant's release. The court clarifies that its observations are limited to the bail decision and do not reflect the case's merits.

{"ID": "id_1222", "Summary": "**Legal Summary of Criminal Appeals No. 72/2023 and No. 183/2023**\n\n**Parties Involved:**\nThe appellants in Criminal Appeal No. 72/2023 are accused Nos. 21, 29, 30, 31, 87, 132, 137, 139, 146, and 157, while in Criminal Appeal No. 183/2023, the appellants are accused Nos. 4, 8, 14, 15, 103, 113, 116, 120, 129, 136, 138, 142, 144, 147, and 148. Both appeals challenge the order dated December 26, 2022, from the XLIX Additional City Civil and Sessions Judge (Special Court for NIA cases), Bengaluru, which rejected their bail applications under Section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.\n\n**Facts of the Case:**\nOn April 16, 2022, a complaint was lodged by Head Constable Sri. J.B. Kalappannavar at the Old Hubballi Police Station, reporting that a WhatsApp status displaying a Saffron Flag on a mosque's dome incited a mob of 1000-1500 individuals, armed with clubs and stones, to gather outside the police station. The mob demanded action against the accused, leading to violent confrontations with police, resulting in injuries to officers and damage to public property. The police registered a case under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), subsequently transferring the investigation to the National Investigation Agency (NIA).\n\n**Arguments by the Appellants:**\nThe appellants' counsel argued that the charges under Sections 16, 18, and 20 of the UAPA were improperly invoked, asserting that the prosecution failed to establish a prima facie case of terrorism or conspiracy. They contended that the mob's actions were spontaneous and not premeditated, thus lacking the necessary elements to classify them as terrorist activities. The counsel also highlighted the absence of evidence linking the appellants to any banned terrorist organizations and emphasized that the trial court's findings were perverse and contrary to established legal principles.\n\n**Arguments by the Respondent (State):**\nThe Special Public Prosecutor contended that the appellants were involved in serious offenses aimed at creating religious disharmony and public disorder. The prosecution presented evidence, including CCTV footage and call detail records, to establish the appellants' presence at the scene and their active participation in the mob's violent actions. The prosecutor argued that releasing the appellants on bail could lead to further disturbances in public peace.\n\n**Court's Consideration:**\nThe court examined the nature of the offenses, the evidence presented, and the implications of the UAPA's stringent bail provisions. It noted that the trial court had correctly identified reasonable grounds for believing the accusations against the appellants were prima facie true, thus justifying the denial of bail under Section 43D(5) of the UAPA. The court emphasized the need for a speedy trial and recommended the establishment of additional special courts to alleviate the backlog of cases under the NIA.\n\n**Decision:**\nThe appeals were dismissed, affirming the trial court's order rejecting the bail applications. The court directed the trial judge to expedite the main proceedings and recommended the state government to establish three additional special courts for NIA cases to ensure timely justice.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe court upheld the rejection of bail for the appellants, citing substantial evidence of their involvement in unlawful activities that threatened public order and safety, while also recognizing the need for systemic reforms to address delays in the judicial process concerning NIA cases."}
{"ID": "id_1224", "Summary": "**Legal Summary:**\n\nOn 18.01.2022, the petitioner Avinash, represented by Mr. Tushar Datta and Mr. Varun Gupta, filed a petition under Section 439 of the Cr.P.C. seeking regular bail in connection with FIR No. 326/2017, which involves charges under Section 376 of the IPC and Section 6 of the POCSO Act, registered at Police Station Govindpuri. The case arose from a PCR call received on 18.08.2017, reporting the sexual assault of a 2.5-year-old girl, the daughter of the complainant Dinesh Dev Nath Rai, by the petitioner, who was a friend of the complainant.\n\nUpon arrival at the scene, the police met the complainant and the accused, subsequently taking them to the police station along with the victim for medical examination. The medical report indicated signs of trauma and alleged sexual assault. The complainant's statement during the investigation confirmed the allegations against the petitioner, leading to his arrest on the same day.\n\nDuring the bail hearing, the petitioner’s counsel argued that he had been in judicial custody for over four years and was falsely implicated, citing inconsistencies in the complainant's testimony and the medical report, which noted no active bleeding. The prosecution, represented by Ms. Neelam Sharma, opposed the bail application, emphasizing the seriousness of the allegations and the victim's supportive testimony recorded under Section 164 of the Cr.P.C. Despite the victim's later contradictory statements and the complainant turning hostile, the prosecution maintained that the gravity of the charges warranted denial of bail.\n\nThe court considered various factors, including the age of the victim, the nature of the allegations, and the potential for the accused to influence the trial if released. It noted that the victim's testimony, although inconsistent, could not be disregarded entirely at this stage. The court ultimately concluded that the serious nature of the allegations, the minor status of the victim at the time of the incident, and the medical evidence presented did not provide sufficient grounds for bail. Consequently, the bail application was dismissed, with the court clarifying that its decision should not be interpreted as a judgment on the merits of the case."}

Higher Judicial Services, 2020. The petitioner contended that despite passing the preliminary examination, she was barred from the final exams due to a lack of continuous legal practice for seven years, as interpreted from the relevant rules and the Supreme Court judgment in Deepak Aggrawal v. Keshav Kaushik (2013) 5 SCC 277.\n\nThe petitioner’s counsel argued that she has been practicing as a public prosecutor since 2019, thus fulfilling the necessary criteria. However, the court highlighted that the interpretation of \"has been\" in Article 233(2) of the Constitution requires continuous practice as an advocate immediately preceding the application, which the petitioner did not meet due to a break in her legal practice from 2017 to 2019 when she held other positions.\n\nThe court referenced the Supreme Court's interpretation in Deepak Aggrawal, emphasizing that the requirement for seven years of practice must be continuous and current. The court also noted that the petitioner had surrendered her practicing license when she was appointed as an Examiner of Trade Marks in 2017, further complicating her eligibility.\n\nAdditionally, the court cited a recent decision involving Shashank Singh, which reinforced the interpretation of the U.P. Higher Judicial Service Rules, stating that only advocates with seven years of continuous practice are eligible for direct recruitment. The court concluded that the petitioner did not meet the eligibility criteria as outlined in Articles 233, 234, and 236 of the Constitution and relevant rules, leading to the dismissal of her petition.\n\nUltimately, the court ruled against the petitioner, affirming that she was not qualified to appear for the examination due to her failure to satisfy the continuous practice requirement, and thus, her petition was dismissed. The court expressed gratitude to both parties' counsel for their assistance in the proceedings."}

The petitioner contended that the 4th respondent publicly insulted the Constitution during a political meeting on July 4, 2022, as reported in the Mathrubhumi newspaper on July 6, 2022. This act was claimed to contravene Articles 173(a) and 188 of the Constitution, leading to a police complaint (Crime No. 0600/22) against the 4th respondent.\n\nThe court examined the applicability of Article 173, which outlines qualifications for State Legislature membership, and noted that the 4th respondent was duly elected and qualified. Consequently, the court found that Article 173 did not apply to disqualify him. However, it acknowledged the relevance of Article 188, which mandates an oath of office for members of the Legislative Assembly, suggesting that the 4th respondent's alleged statements could warrant disqualification.\n\nThe court noted that while a crime had been registered under the Insults to National Honour Act, 1971, there was no reference to the Representation of the People Act, 1951, regarding disqualification procedures. The Advocate General highlighted that Articles 191 and 192 of the Constitution set forth specific disqualifications and procedures for determining a member's eligibility, emphasizing that disqualification requires adherence to constitutional parameters.\n\nThe court referenced a prior decision (K. C. Chandy v. R. Balakrishna Pillai) indicating that a breach of oath by a Minister does not automatically lead to disqualification. The petitioner was directed to provide relevant provisions from the Representation of the People Act, 1951, and any pertinent orders from the Election Commission of India to support the claims made in the writ petition. The court's decision underscored the necessity of established legal frameworks and procedures in addressing disqualification matters within the legislative context."}

Upon discovering the assault, PW.1 took her daughter to the hospital, where medical examinations revealed evidence of sexual assault, including tears to the hymen and bleeding.\n\nThe police registered a case based on PW.1's statement, leading to an investigation that included testimonies from multiple witnesses and medical examinations.

The charges against them include serious offences under Sections 294(b), 323, 324, 353, 354, and 506(i) of the Indian Penal Code, in connection with an incident that occurred on March 14, 2023. During this incident, the accused allegedly wrongfully restrained an Advocate Commissioner executing a court order, verbally assaulted her and others present, and physically attacked the defacto complainant, resulting in serious injuries.\n\nThe petitioners were arrested on April 12, 2023, and have been in judicial custody since then. Their counsel argues for bail, asserting their innocence and claiming they were falsely implicated due to ongoing civil disputes. The counsel emphasizes that the petitioners have been detained for over 50 days, and further detention is unnecessary, as they are willing to comply with any conditions set by the court.\n\nConversely, the Public Prosecutor opposes the bail application, citing the serious nature of the allegations and the incorporation of additional charges under Section 326 due to the injuries sustained by the defacto complainant. The prosecutor contends that releasing the petitioners could prejudice the ongoing investigation.\n\nUpon reviewing the case, the court acknowledges the serious allegations but notes the significant duration of the petitioners' custody and the progress made in the investigation. Although the first petitioner has prior criminal cases and the second petitioner was previously involved in a CBI case, the latter has been acquitted. Weighing these factors, the court decides to grant bail, imposing several conditions to ensure compliance and prevent interference with the investigation.\n\nThe conditions for bail include: executing a bond of Rs 1,00,000 with two solvent sureties, cooperating fully with the investigation, appearing before the Investigating Officer every Saturday, not committing similar offences while on bail, refraining from contacting prosecution witnesses, and not leaving the State of Kerala without court permission.

{"ID": "id_1260", "Summary": "On September 26, 2022, the High Court addressed a writ petition (WP(C)) filed by a 21-year-old woman seeking permission for medical termination of her 21-week pregnancy. The petitioner, who had eloped and married the 7th respondent, faced severe domestic abuse and emotional distress, leading her to return to her parental home. After realizing her pregnancy in April 2022, she sought termination due to the psychological impact of her circumstances, including her husband's refusal to support her and allegations regarding the paternity of the unborn child.\n\nThe petitioner approached the Family Planning Clinic at Kottayam Medical College but was denied the procedure due to the absence of legal documents proving her separation from her husband. Following a police complaint against her husband and mother-in-law for domestic violence, she filed the writ petition seeking a mandamus to allow her to undergo medical termination of pregnancy (MTP) and to direct the Medical Board to examine her.\n\nThe Medical Board, constituted by the court, opined that while the fetus showed no anomalies, the continuation of the pregnancy could negatively impact the petitioner’s mental health. The petitioner’s counsel argued for a liberal interpretation of the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971, emphasizing the woman’s right to make reproductive choices, particularly in light of her distressing circumstances.\n\nThe court noted that the MTP Act allows for termination if the continuation poses a risk to the woman's mental health, and highlighted that the petitioner’s situation warranted consideration beyond strict legal definitions of marital status. The court referenced previous rulings that recognized a woman's right to reproductive autonomy under Article 21 of the Constitution, asserting that the drastic changes in the petitioner’s marital life constituted a significant alteration of her status.\n\nUltimately, the court ruled in favor of the petitioner, permitting her to terminate the pregnancy at Kottayam Medical College or any government hospital, directing the hospital to facilitate the procedure promptly. The court also mandated that if the baby were born alive, the hospital would provide necessary medical care, and if the petitioner chose not to take responsibility, the state would assume that role.\n\nThis decision underscores the court's recognition of women's rights, particularly in the context of reproductive health, and the importance of considering individual circumstances in legal interpretations."}

Athar Rasheed, aged 35, died following a hair transplantation procedure at United Hair Studio in Rohini, New Delhi, which allegedly involved negligence. After the procedure, he experienced severe pain and swelling, leading to his admission at Escorts Heart Institute, where he ultimately succumbed on June 26, 2021. Despite a complaint lodged on July 6, 2021, no action was taken by the police, prompting the writ petition.\n\nThe inquiry revealed that the cause of death was septic shock due to Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, and the medical facility did not notify the police, citing the nature of the death. Following the petition, an Action Taken Report was requested from the Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), leading to the registration of FIR No. 339/2022 under Sections 304/34 of the Indian Penal Code and Sections 26/27 of the Delhi Medical Council Act. The investigation revealed that Shivam Verma, one of the accused, operated United Hair Studio and received payment from Athar Rasheed for the hair transplant, which was performed by unqualified technicians, Mohit and Vijay. The latter was arrested, while Mohit remains at large.\n\nThe court noted gross negligence, emphasizing that the criminal proceedings were initiated only after the writ petition was filed. It highlighted the broader implications of unregulated hair transplantation practices, which are often performed by unqualified individuals in salons, violating medical ethics and protocols. The court stressed that such procedures should only be conducted by qualified dermatologists or trained surgeons with informed patient consent, as the lack of proper medical supervision poses significant risks, including irreversible harm or death.\n\nThe judgment called for immediate action from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and the Government of NCT of Delhi to regulate hair transplantation practices and ensure that only qualified professionals perform such procedures. It urged the establishment of national protocols for aesthetic surgeries and emphasized the need for public awareness regarding the dangers of undergoing hair transplants without proper medical oversight. The court directed that copies of the order be forwarded to relevant authorities for necessary action and scheduled the next hearing for July 27, 2022."}

The application was transferred to the court by the Principal Sessions Judge for legal disposal. The applicant contended that she had not committed any offense and was suffering from multiple ailments, currently receiving treatment at a military hospital.\n\nThe court reviewed the case file, which included a complaint from Balbir Singh, the father of the deceased, Manju Charak, who alleged that Manju committed suicide due to continuous cruelty and dowry demands from her in-laws, including the applicant. The investigation revealed prima facie evidence against Raj Kumari, indicating her involvement in the alleged physical and mental torture of the deceased, contributing to her tragic decision to end her life.\n\nThe court expressed concern over the societal issues surrounding dowry-related crimes, emphasizing the detrimental role that mothers-in-law often play in such situations. It highlighted the need for a supportive family environment to prevent such tragedies and called for the establishment of marriage counseling centers to address misunderstandings between daughters-in-law and their in-laws.\n\nDespite the applicant's claims of health issues, the court found the gravity of the allegations against her significant enough to deny the anticipatory bail request. The court reiterated that anticipatory bail is intended for individuals wrongfully implicated in offenses, not for those clearly involved in serious crimes like dowry death.

The petitioner expressed deep emotional distress over the situation, highlighting the societal responsibility to support families facing such trauma. The court acknowledged the need for comprehensive sex education to prevent similar incidents and emphasized the importance of a supportive family environment.\n\nThe petition included several requests: to issue a writ mandamus for the immediate termination of the pregnancy, to declare that the continuation of the pregnancy would cause serious mental harm to the minor, to restore custody of the minor to her parents, to dispense with the requirement for English translations of vernacular documents, and to grant any other relief deemed appropriate.\n\nOn May 16, 2023, the court received a medical report from a Special Medical Board, which confirmed that the minor was physically and mentally fit for the termination of her pregnancy. The report indicated that continuing the pregnancy could severely impact her social and mental health, and complications from teenage pregnancy were likely. The board also noted the risks associated with the potential birth of a premature infant, given that the minor was already over 32 weeks pregnant.\n\nFollowing the submission of an affidavit by the petitioner acknowledging the risks involved, the court found the termination of the pregnancy necessary, citing previous judicial decisions that supported such actions in similar circumstances. The court ordered the relevant authorities to proceed with the medical termination without delay and mandated that a report be submitted post-procedure to address any further issues.\n\nSubsequent hearings addressed the restoration of custody of the minor and the newborn. The Child Welfare Committee ultimately placed the minor mother in the care of her uncle and confirmed that the newborn had been surrendered to the committee. The court concluded that no further orders were necessary, emphasizing the state's duty to protect the newborn and the need for societal change to prevent such incidents in the future.

The contempt petition arose from alleged willful violations of court orders dated October 15, 2020, and December 21, 2020, concerning the construction of a boundary wall to secure the Petitioner’s property.\n\nThe Petitioner had initially approached the court through W.P.(C) No. 7356/2021 due to the non-consideration of her application for the boundary wall. The court, upon reviewing a police status report, recognized the vulnerability of the Petitioner’s property and ordered the Deputy Commissioner to address her application within two months. Subsequently, the court directed police protection during the construction of the boundary wall, which was completed on December 24, 2020, following an undertaking by the Petitioner to remove it if required by the Deputy Commissioner.\n\nHowever, on January 3, 2022, Respondent No. 1, with assistance, demolished the boundary wall, prompting the Petitioner to file an FIR against him for criminal trespass. The court noted the lack of police action despite the FIR and issued a notice to Respondent No. 1. On March 7, 2022, the court found Respondent No. 1 guilty of contempt, rejecting his apology and highlighting the deliberate nature of the demolition, which was executed using a JCB excavator.\n\nDuring the proceedings, Respondent No. 1 claimed the demolition was based on a misunderstanding regarding property boundaries. However, the court emphasized that he was present during the earlier orders and could not claim ignorance. The court reiterated that the demolition was a calculated act to undermine its authority, thereby warranting contempt proceedings.\n\nCiting the Supreme Court's judgment in In Re: Vinay Chandra, the court underscored the importance of upholding the dignity of the judiciary and the rule of law. It concluded that Respondent No. 1's actions not only disrespected the court's orders but also threatened the judicial system's integrity.

The appellant was arrested in connection with Crime No. 108/2021, facing serious charges under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012, and the Atrocities Act.\n\nDuring the proceedings, the court noted the absence of the complainant, represented by the Additional Public Prosecutor, allowing the appeal to proceed. The appellant's counsel argued for bail, citing the completion of the investigation and the appellant's young age, asserting that the victim had willingly eloped with the appellant and stayed with him for approximately 45 days. However, the court found these claims unconvincing upon reviewing the charge-sheet.\n\nThe court highlighted that the victim, as indicated by her School Leaving Certificate, was below 18 years of age, categorizing her as a \"child\" under the POCSO Act. The appellant's counsel contended the lack of primary evidence regarding the victim's age, but the court maintained that this issue could be addressed during the trial. The victim's statement revealed that she had not consented to the appellant's advances and had been threatened by him, which was corroborated by medical evidence and witness testimonies, supporting the charges against the appellant.\n\nThe court emphasized that consent obtained through threats or from a minor holds no legal value. Additionally, the appellant's lack of ties to Maharashtra raised concerns about his potential flight risk.

The appellant was implicated in a series of financial irregularities that resulted in significant losses to a consortium of banks, leading to his arrest on June 22, 2022, following a fourth supplementary complaint filed under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (PMLA).\n\nThe facts reveal that SBFL, managed by its directors, including the appellant's uncle, faced scrutiny after a forensic audit uncovered discrepancies amounting to ₹3,269.42 crores. An FIR was registered by the CBI for various offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act and the Indian Penal Code, leading to the recording of an Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR) against the appellant and others.\n\nThe appellant's counsel argued that he was not named in the initial FIR or earlier complaints, asserting that the investigation against him was complete and that he should not be detained indefinitely. The counsel also cited the principle of parity, noting that a co-accused had been granted bail under similar circumstances.\n\nConversely, the Additional Solicitor General contended that the appellant played a significant role in the alleged bank fraud and money laundering activities, emphasizing that the conditions for bail under Section 45 of the PMLA were not met. The court highlighted that the PMLA aims to combat money laundering and that the offence is independent of the predicate crime, focusing instead on the activities connected with the proceeds of crime.\n\nThe Supreme Court, while dismissing the appeal, reiterated that the conditions for bail under the PMLA are stringent and must be satisfied. It noted that the appellant had not demonstrated reasonable grounds for believing he was not guilty of the charges or that he would not commit further offences if released. The court emphasized the serious nature of economic offences and the need for a cautious approach in granting bail, particularly in cases involving significant financial misconduct.\n\nUltimately, the court upheld the High Court's decision, reinforcing the legal framework surrounding money laundering and the necessity for rigorous scrutiny in bail applications related to such offences."}
{"ID": "id_1317", "Summary": "In the Writ Petition (Criminal) No. 2168 of 2020, Smt. Anjali @ Afsana and another petitioner sought police protection from the State of Uttarakhand due to apprehensions of physical harm from the petitioner's brothers, respondents nos. 3 and 4. The petitioners, who belong to different faiths, married on December 16, 2020, following the conversion of petitioner no. 1 from Islam to Hinduism. The Court noted that this conversion may violate the Uttarakhand Freedom of Religion Act, 2018, as the necessary permission from the District Magistrate had not been obtained, despite the petitioners claiming to have submitted an application.\n\nDuring the video conferencing hearing, both petitioners expressed their concerns regarding their safety, prompting the Court to direct the District Magistrate of Haridwar to investigate the status of the conversion application. In light of the potential threat, the Court invoked precedents from the Supreme Court, specifically the cases of Lata Singh vs. State of U.P. and S. Khushboo vs. Kanniammal, to order the Senior Superintendent of Police, Haridwar, to ensure the petitioners receive adequate protection.\n\nThe Court issued notices to respondents nos. 3 and 4, allowing them three weeks to file a counter affidavit, and scheduled the next hearing for March 5, 2021. Additionally, the Registrar General was instructed to forward the order to the District Magistrate for compliance. The interim relief application was disposed of accordingly."}
{"ID": "id_1328", "Summary": "In the case of WP(C) No.17222/2023, the petitioner sought an order from the High Court to compel the respondents to sanction and disburse an education loan of Rs.4,07,200/- within a specified timeframe. The petition was admitted on May 30, 2023, with the learned Standing Counsel acknowledging notice for the respondents. The petitioner, represented by Senior Counsel Adv. George Poonthottam, argued that the immediate disbursement of the loan was crucial to avoid significant difficulties, citing previous judgments (Exts.P3 and P4) that supported the need for a more lenient approach regarding credit scores in educational loan applications.\n\nThe respondents, represented by Senior Counsel Adv. K.K. Chandran Pillai, opposed the interim order, highlighting the petitioner’s low CIBIL score of 560, which was attributed to two prior loans, one of which was overdue. They contended that the rejection of the loan application was justified based on the petitioner’s creditworthiness. However, the court referenced Ext.P3, which emphasized that the credit scores of the petitioner’s parents should not solely determine the loan eligibility, particularly when the petitioner, an OBC community member, was seeking funds for a B.Tech course outside the state.\n\nThe court noted that previous judgments indicated that rejecting loan applications based on the credit scores of parents was arbitrary and contrary to the Reserve Bank of India’s guidelines. It was also highlighted that the petitioner had received a scholarship for his first two semesters, further supporting his financial viability for loan repayment post-education. The court ultimately determined that the balance of convenience favored the petitioner, who had secured a job offer in Oman, thus demonstrating potential for loan repayment.\n\nIn conclusion, the court ordered the respondents to sanction and disburse the education loan of Rs.4,07,200/- to the petitioner’s college immediately, while allowing the respondents to file a counter affidavit and seek an early hearing of the case. All contentions raised by the respondents were left open for future consideration."}
{"ID": "id_136", "Summary": "In the case before the court, the Petitioner, represented by Senior Advocate Mr. Colin Gonsalves and Advocate Ms. Kawalpreet Kaur, filed a writ petition against Respondent Nos. 1 and 2, Meta Platforms Inc., and Respondent No. 3, the Union of India, seeking directions to monitor and suspend hate speech and harmful content directed towards the Rohingya community on Facebook. The petition, framed as a Public Interest Litigation under Article 21 of the Constitution of India, argues that the algorithms used by Facebook amplify hate speech, thereby threatening the Right to Life of the Rohingya community in India.\n\nThe Petitioner contends that Facebook's practices, which allegedly promote hate speech for revenue generation, violate Section 153-A(1)(b) of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. They cite reports, including one from Amnesty International, to support their claim that Facebook has failed to adequately address the spread of harmful content, despite its promises to do so. The Petitioner also seeks to empower the Union of India to impose prior censorship on publications related to the Rohingya community.\n\nIn response, Mr. Arvind P. Datar, representing Meta Platforms Inc., argues that the company has implemented measures in compliance with the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021, which obligate social media platforms to prevent the dissemination of hate speech. He asserts that the Respondents have taken significant steps to remove objectionable content, citing the removal of over 100,000 posts in November 2023 alone. Datar disputes the allegations of promoting hate speech and emphasizes that the nature of social media platforms inherently leads to the magnification of news.\n\nThe Union of India, represented by Mr. Apoorv Kurup, supports the Respondents, highlighting the regulatory framework established by the IT Rules, 2021, which includes grievance redressal mechanisms and emergency provisions for blocking harmful content. Kurup notes that the Petitioners did not raise their grievances with the Union of India prior to filing the writ petition.\n\nThe court, after considering the arguments, finds that the Petitioners were unaware of the existing legal obligations and regulatory framework governing social media platforms. It concludes that the directions sought by the Petitioners are not maintainable, as there is no evidence that Meta Platforms Inc. has failed to comply with its statutory obligations. The court emphasizes that the Petitioners have an alternative and efficacious remedy available under the IT Rules, 2021, and thus disposes of the writ petition, allowing the Petitioners to pursue the established grievance redressal mechanisms."}
{"ID": "id_1367", "Summary": "**Legal Summary of SLP (C) No. 22337 of 2008**\n\nThis case arises from a Special Leave Petition concerning the Advocates Act, 1961, which was enacted to reform judicial administration in post-independence India, following recommendations from the Law Commission and the All India Bar Committee. The Act establishes the framework for State Bar Councils and the Bar Council of India, delineating their functions, including the exclusive right of advocates to practice law as per Sections 7 and 49.\n\nThe dispute originated between the Bar Council of India and Bonnie Foi Law College regarding the college's application for affiliation to conduct legal studies. An inspection team appointed by the Court identified deficiencies in the college's infrastructure, leading to conditions imposed on the college for compliance. This situation highlighted broader concerns about the declining standards of legal education across India, prompting the formation of a Committee led by Mr. Gopal Subramanium to evaluate law college affiliations and propose reforms.\n\nThe Committee's report, submitted on October 6, 2009, recommended the introduction of a bar examination and mandatory apprenticeship under senior lawyers prior to enrollment. It noted that while the requirement for apprenticeship was previously mandated, it was removed by the 1973 Amendment to the Act. The report emphasized the need for the Bar Council of India to reaffirm its role in regulating legal education standards.\n\nOn December 14, 2009, the Court directed the Central Government to implement the Committee's recommendations, including the conduct of the first All India Bar Examination in mid-2010. Subsequently, a three-Judge Bench referred critical questions regarding the Bar Council of India's authority to prescribe pre-enrollment training and examinations to a Constitution Bench for authoritative resolution.\n\nThe Bench considered significant precedents, including the judgment in V. Sudeer v. Bar Council of India, which ruled that the Bar Council of India lacked the authority to impose pre-enrollment training and examinations due to the 1973 Amendment. However, the current proceedings raised the possibility of reconsidering this position, particularly in light of the Bar Council's powers under Section 49(1)(ag) to prescribe rules for enrollment.\n\nThe Amicus Curiae, Mr. K.V. Vishwanathan, argued that the Bar Council of India retains the authority to impose pre-enrollment conditions, emphasizing the need for quality control in legal practice. The Court acknowledged the importance of maintaining high standards in the legal profession and the necessity for the Bar Council of India to have the power to regulate entry into the profession.\n\nUltimately, the Court concluded that the restrictions imposed by the V. Sudeer judgment were unsustainable and that the Bar Council of India could validly prescribe pre-enrollment training and examinations. The Court left it to the Bar Council to determine the timing of the All India Bar Examination, whether pre or post-enrollment, while emphasizing the need for uniformity and fairness in the examination process.\n\nThe judgment is intended to enhance the quality of legal practitioners entering the profession, ensuring that only well-equipped individuals are allowed to practice law. The Court disposed of the civil appeal and petitions, directing the Bar Council of India to take necessary actions within three months to implement the judgment's directives, while allowing the parties to bear their own costs."}

{"ID": "id_138", "Summary": "In the case of Ajay Kumar De v. The State of West Bengal & Ors., a Public Interest Litigation was filed concerning the potential challenges posed by the Gangasagar Mela amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. The petitioners raised concerns about public health and safety during the event scheduled from January 8 to January 17, 2021. During the initial hearing on January 7, 2021, the Advocate General outlined the measures taken for crowd management and medical facilities, acknowledging a possible reduction in attendance due to the pandemic.\n\nThe court emphasized the paramount importance of life over religious practices and requested the State to provide an affidavit from a Senior Medical Officer detailing preventive measures against the spread of COVID-19, particularly concerning waterborne transmission during large gatherings. The court noted that social distancing would be challenging in such scenarios and highlighted the need for effective disaster management strategies.\n\nOn January 8, 2021, the Director of Health Services submitted a comprehensive report detailing the arrangements for the Mela, which included mandatory mask usage, physical distancing, and sanitization protocols. Key measures outlined in the report included the establishment of medical screening camps, rapid testing facilities, and extensive public awareness campaigns to ensure compliance with COVID-19 protocols. The report also detailed crowd control measures, including the deployment of thousands of police and volunteers, installation of CCTV cameras, and the use of drones for monitoring.\n\nThe court acknowledged the State's efforts but expressed concerns regarding the potential for contamination in water bodies due to large gatherings. It urged the administration to promote e-snans (virtual bathing) to minimize physical contact with the water. The court mandated that all protective measures be implemented not only at the Mela site but also in Kolkata and surrounding areas where large congregations were occurring.\n\nThe State Government confirmed that no fees would be imposed on pilgrims under the Gangasagar Mela Act, 1976, and was encouraged to incentivize e-snans to promote safer practices. The court expressed confidence in the State's ability to manage the situation effectively, as demonstrated during previous festivals, and scheduled a follow-up hearing for January 13, 2021, to assess the situation and determine the feasibility of holding the Mela in light of public health concerns."}

This recommendation originated from the Madras High Court Collegium on 3 August 2022, and was subsequently concurred by the Chief Minister and the Governor of Tamil Nadu. On 17 January 2023, the Supreme Court Collegium reviewed the proposal but deferred its decision pending additional information from the government, which ultimately indicated no further inputs were available.\n\nOn 9 May 2023, the Collegium again deferred its decision to seek insights from two members of the High Court Collegium regarding the candidates' suitability, particularly in light of concerns raised by the government. Following the appointment of Justice Sanjay V Gangapurwala as Chief Justice of the Madras High Court, he was asked to provide the views of the newly constituted High Court Collegium on the candidates' qualifications. The Chief Justice submitted the Collegium's minutes on 27 June 2023.\n\nIn accordance with the Memorandum of Procedure, the Supreme Court Judges familiar with the Madras High Court's affairs were consulted to evaluate the candidates' fitness. The Collegium meticulously reviewed the materials presented, including the Department of Justice's observations.\n\nFor Shri N Senthilkumar, the Collegium noted his extensive experience of over twenty-eight years in various legal domains, including constitutional and criminal law, and his role on government panels. His professional standing, reflected in his income and thirty reported judgments, alongside his Scheduled Caste background, supports the view that his elevation would enhance representation of marginalized communities on the Bench.\n\nSimilarly, for Shri G Arul Murugan, the Collegium acknowledged his twenty-four years of experience, specializing in civil, criminal, and writ cases, with seventy-five reported judgments to his credit. His OBC status further underscores the importance of his appointment in promoting greater representation within the higher judiciary.\n\nConsequently, the Collegium resolved to recommend the appointments of both Shri N Senthilkumar and Shri G Arul Murugan as Judges of the Madras High Court, with their seniority to be determined according to existing practices."}

The respondents included the State of U.P. and various officials, with representation from both the Central and State governments.\n\nThe court, presided over by Hon'ble Justices Siddhartha Varma and Ajit Kumar, conducted hearings via video conferencing, involving key government officials and legal representatives. A compliance affidavit was submitted by the State, detailing the establishment of a three-member Pandemic Public Grievance Committee in each district, as previously ordered by the court. This committee is tasked with addressing individual grievances and ensuring timely redressal, particularly concerning oxygen supply for home-isolated patients and private healthcare facilities.\n\nThe court reviewed reports from district officials regarding health infrastructure, revealing significant inadequacies in urban and rural healthcare facilities. For instance, in Bijnor district, the absence of a Level-3 hospital and insufficient life-saving equipment was highlighted, with only 150 beds available for a rapidly growing population. The court emphasized the urgent need for increased testing and healthcare resources, particularly in rural areas, to prevent a potential third wave of the pandemic.\n\nThe court also addressed a specific incident involving a patient, Santosh Kumar, who went missing from a hospital, attributing the failure to identify him to severe negligence by medical staff. The court criticized the state's response as inadequate and called for accountability and compensation for the victim's family.\n\nOn vaccination efforts, the court noted the need for widespread vaccination and robust medical infrastructure. Suggestions were made for the state to explore global tenders for vaccine procurement and to incentivize private entities to contribute to vaccination efforts. The court mandated that all nursing homes and hospitals enhance their oxygen supply capabilities and improve ICU facilities.\n\nFurthermore, the court directed the appointment of Nodal Officers in various districts to ensure compliance with its orders and to report on the status of healthcare improvements. The court scheduled a follow-up hearing for May 22, 2021, to assess progress and compliance with its directives.\n\nIn conclusion, the court's ruling underscored the critical need for immediate action to enhance healthcare infrastructure, ensure accountability for medical negligence, and facilitate effective vaccination strategies in Uttar Pradesh amidst the ongoing pandemic."}
{"ID": "id_1392", "Summary": "In the present writ petition filed under Article 32 of the Constitution of India, the petitioner seeks the release of her husband on default bail, emphasizing the critical issue of personal liberty as protected under Article 21. The case originated from an FIR lodged under Section 120(B) and Section 420 of the Indian Penal Code, along with provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act, where the petitioner’s husband was initially not named. Subsequent supplementary chargesheets were filed, with the husband later designated as a prosecution witness, yet he remained unnamed in these documents until his arrest by the CBI on April 28, 2022.\n\nThe petitioner contends that the continued remand of her husband violates his fundamental rights, as the investigation remains incomplete beyond the statutory period prescribed by the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). The petitioner’s counsel argued that the trial court should not have remanded the accused under Section 309 of the CrPC given the ongoing investigation, citing the precedent set in M. Ravindran Vs. The Intelligence Officer, Directorate of Revenue Intelligence.\n\nConversely, the respondent's counsel argued that the writ is not maintainable and that the accused should have sought relief from the High Court or filed a Special Leave Petition. They further contended that the FIR is not a complete document and that the supplementary chargesheet filed on June 25, 2022, suffices to extinguish the right to default bail.\n\nThe Court identified three key issues for consideration: the legality of piecemeal chargesheets without completing the investigation, the impact of such chargesheets on the right to default bail, and the trial court's authority to continue remand during ongoing investigations. The Court rejected the preliminary objection regarding the maintainability of the writ, asserting its duty to protect civil liberties and fundamental rights.\n\nThe Court emphasized that the right to default bail under Section 167(2) of the CrPC is a fundamental right linked to Article 21, mandating that investigations be completed within a stipulated time. It highlighted that the practice of filing incomplete chargesheets to prolong custody undermines this right. The Court reiterated that the right to default bail is not extinguished by the filing of supplementary chargesheets if the investigation remains pending.\n\nUltimately, the Court found that the trial court had failed to uphold the legal standards regarding remand and default bail, leading to a violation of the accused's rights. The interim bail granted earlier was made absolute, and the writ petition was disposed of accordingly, reinforcing the necessity of safeguarding individual liberties against arbitrary state action."}

Annadurai's birthday on September 15, 2023. The petitioner, represented by Senior Counsel Mr. G. Karthikeyan, argued that the circular was unconstitutional and undermined the secular fabric of the nation, violating the fundamental duties outlined in Article 51A of the Constitution, particularly regarding unity and social harmony.\n\nThe respondents, including the Secretary of the Home Department and the Secretary of the Education Department, were represented by Special Government Pleader Mr. C. Kathiravan, who informed the court that the circular had been withdrawn. The court acknowledged the ongoing debates surrounding Sanathana Dharma, recognizing it as a set of eternal duties that encompass responsibilities towards the nation, family, and society. The court emphasized that while the right to free speech is protected under Article 19(1)(a), it is not absolute and must be exercised with consideration for the rights of others, particularly in matters of religion.\n\nThe court further noted that untouchability, although historically associated with certain interpretations of Sanathana Dharma, is constitutionally abolished under Article 17, and every citizen has a duty to uphold the Constitution's ideals. The court encouraged the college to engage students in discussions about the eradication of untouchability, reinforcing the importance of constructive dialogue in promoting societal progress.\n\nUltimately, since the circular was withdrawn, the court deemed the petition moot and disposed of it without costs, while advocating for continued reflection on the principles of equality and the elimination of social evils."}

The prosecution alleged that Harmeet faced continuous harassment and cruelty from the appellant and his family due to unmet dowry demands, including a car and cash amounting to Rs. 5 lakhs. Following her death, her father lodged a complaint detailing the harassment she endured, which included physical abuse and isolation.\n\n**Procedural History:**  \nThe trial court acquitted the appellant's siblings but convicted him under Sections 498A (cruelty) and 304B (dowry death) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), sentencing him to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment for Section 304B and 3 years for Section 498A, along with a fine. The appellant appealed against this conviction, claiming false allegations and lack of evidence.\n\n**Arguments:**  \nThe appellant's counsel argued that the allegations were based on hearsay and that he was not present during the incident. Conversely, the State's counsel emphasized the seriousness of the allegations, citing the victim's letters and testimonies from her family, which corroborated the claims of dowry demands and cruelty.\n\n**Legal Reasoning:**  \nThe court examined the essential ingredients of Sections 498A and 304B IPC, noting that the victim's death occurred under abnormal circumstances within seven years of marriage, and she had been subjected to cruelty linked to dowry demands. The testimonies of the victim's parents and other witnesses were found credible, establishing a pattern of abuse and harassment leading to her suicide.\n\n**Decision:**  \nThe court upheld the trial court's judgment, affirming the conviction and sentence of the appellant. It highlighted the societal issues surrounding dowry deaths and the psychological trauma faced by women in such circumstances. The appellant was directed to surrender within 30 days to serve the remaining portion of his sentence.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis case underscores the judicial system's commitment to addressing dowry-related violence and the importance of protecting women's rights within marriage. The court's decision serves as a reminder of the ongoing struggle against societal norms that perpetuate such injustices."}
{"ID": "id_1404", "Summary": "In the case of W.P.(C) 8654/2021, the petitioner sought to quash the order dated 27.07.2021, which appointed Mr. Rakesh Asthana as Commissioner of Police, Delhi, and extended his service beyond the age of superannuation. The petitioner argued that this appointment violated various legal provisions, including the Fundamental Rules (FR-56(d)), the All India Services (Death-cum-Retirement Benefits) Rules, 1958, and the Supreme Court's directives in the Prakash Singh cases regarding the appointment of police officers.\n\nThe petitioner contended that the appointment was made without following the proper procedure, as Mr. Asthana was not empanelled by the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) and did not have the required residual service of six months prior to retirement. The petitioner also claimed that the extension of service beyond the age of sixty was illegal, as it did not fall under any exceptions provided in the relevant rules.\n\nThe respondents, represented by the Solicitor General, defended the appointment, asserting that the Central Government had the authority to grant relaxation of the rules under Rule 3 of the Rules, 1960, which allows for exceptions in cases of undue hardship. They argued that the unique circumstances of Delhi, being the national capital with specific law and order challenges, justified the appointment of an experienced officer like Mr. Asthana.\n\nThe court examined the arguments and found that the Supreme Court's directives in the Prakash Singh cases were primarily applicable to the appointment of Directors General of Police (DGP) in states and did not extend to the appointment of police commissioners in Union Territories like Delhi. The court noted that the appointment process followed the statutory provisions of the Delhi Police Act, 1978, and the Transaction of Business Rules, 1993.\n\nThe court concluded that the Central Government's decision to appoint Mr. Asthana and extend his service was valid, as it was made in public interest and in accordance with the powers granted under the relevant rules. The petition was dismissed, and the court emphasized that public interest litigation should not interfere with service matters unless there is a clear violation of statutory provisions.\n\nIn summary, the court upheld the appointment of Mr. Rakesh Asthana as Commissioner of Police, Delhi, finding no legal violations in the process and affirming the Central Government's discretion in such appointments."}

The charges against him included various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) related to rioting, conspiracy, and public property damage, as well as violations of the Arms Act.\n\nThe applicant's counsel referenced a prior order from the Hon'ble High Court, which allowed the withdrawal of a previous bail application without prejudice, and argued that the current application should be granted based on the observations made in earlier proceedings. Specifically, the defense highlighted that the Supreme Court's directive in **S.G. Vombatkare vs. Union of India** had placed a stay on prosecutions under Section 124A IPC, leaving only the charge under Section 153A IPC to be considered.\n\nThe Special Public Prosecutor for the state did not oppose the bail application, acknowledging that the case fell within the provisions of Section 436A CrPC, particularly in light of the Supreme Court's directions and the court's previous observations regarding the scant evidence linking the applicant to the alleged rioting. The court noted that the prosecution's case relied heavily on conjecture and lacked substantial evidence to establish a direct connection between Imam's speech and the actions of the alleged rioters.\n\nAfter reviewing the arguments and the record, the court concluded that the applicant's case met the criteria for bail under Section 436A CrPC. Consequently, Sharjeel Imam was granted bail upon furnishing a personal bond of Rs. 30,000 with a surety of the same amount, subject to conditions requiring him to remain accessible via a working mobile number and to inform the investigating officer of any address changes. The application was disposed of accordingly, and a copy of the order was directed to be sent to the applicant through the concerned Jail Superintendent for his information."}

The applicant was represented by Dr. Samarth S. Karmarkar, while the State was represented by Ms. Mahalakshmi Ganapathy, and Mr. Durivendra Dubey appeared for the intervenor.\n\nThe First Information Report (FIR) was filed by the informant, who detailed her relationship with the applicant, which began after they connected through a matrimonial site. They married on June 15, 2022, after the applicant requested financial assistance, leading the informant to provide him with ₹7 lakhs and to pledge her ornaments for a loan of ₹32 lakhs. However, in December 2022, the informant suspected the applicant of infidelity, prompting her to return to her parental home on January 5, 2023. Subsequent inquiries revealed that the applicant had been previously married four times, with the first wife having passed away, which formed the basis of the FIR.\n\nThe applicant's counsel contended that the allegations were unfounded, asserting that the applicant had only married the informant after his first wife's death and had not engaged in any other marriages. Conversely, the intervenor's counsel presented documents indicating the applicant's prior marriages and his status as the father on multiple birth certificates.\n\nThe learned Additional Public Prosecutor (APP) supported the intervenor's claims and submitted investigation papers to the court. These documents included two birth certificates from 2009, each listing the applicant as the father of children born to different mothers, alongside divorce proceedings from 2008 and ongoing proceedings from 2018, which further substantiated the claims of the applicant's deceit towards the informant.\n\nUpon reviewing the evidence, the court found substantial material indicating that the applicant had concealed his marital history and had engaged in acts of cheating against multiple women. Consequently, the court determined that the applicant did not meet the criteria for anticipatory bail, leading to the rejection of his application."}
{"ID": "id_1455", "Summary": "In the case of **ARG Outlier Media Private Limited & another v.

The petitioners contended that the FIR and subsequent investigation were maliciously initiated, as they were not named as accused in the FIR but were labeled as 'suspects' in the chargesheets, a term not recognized in criminal jurisprudence.\n\nThe allegations stemmed from a complaint claiming that bribes were paid to inflate Television Rating Points (TRP) for certain channels, with the petitioners' channel specifically mentioned in a press conference by the Mumbai Police Commissioner. However, the petitioners argued that there was no substantive evidence linking them to the alleged TRP scam, and the ongoing investigation appeared to be a tactic to harass them without any formal charges.\n\nThe court considered the petitioners' arguments and noted that the investigation was still ongoing, with no charges filed against them. The petition raised significant legal questions regarding the validity of the FIR and the continued investigation without formal accusations. The court admitted the petition and set a returnable date for further proceedings.\n\nRegarding interim relief, the petitioners expressed concerns about potential coercive actions against them, particularly given past experiences where one petitioner had been arrested despite a prior closure of a related case. The Respondent-State opposed the interim relief, asserting that the investigation was necessary and that the petitioners should face it without special status.\n\nUltimately, the court granted limited protection to the petitioners, stipulating that if the investigating officer wished to summon Petitioner No. 2, they must provide a three-day notice. Additionally, if coercive action was contemplated, a 72-hour notice was required to allow the petitioner to seek legal recourse. The court emphasized the need for this procedure due to the serious allegations of malafide conduct against the respondents and scheduled the next hearing for June 28, 2021."}

{"ID": "id_1460", "Summary": "In the case identified by Neutral Citation Number 2022/DHC/004558, the Petitioners filed a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) seeking a writ of Mandamus to compel the Union of India and its agencies to include Homoeopathic medicines, specifically Arsenicum album – Phosphorus – Tuberculinum (APT), in the intervention protocol for preventing COVID-19 infections. They requested several specific directives, including the urgent notification of APT as a preventive measure, permission for Homoeopathic practitioners to treat mild COVID-19 cases, and the initiation of clinical trials for APT.\n\nThe Respondents, including the Central Council for Research in Homoeopathy (CCRH), countered that the Petitioners' claims were unfounded and that they had failed to follow proper procedures for conducting clinical trials. The CCRH emphasized that the Ministry of Ayush had already issued guidelines permitting research into COVID-19 treatments using Homoeopathy, and that the Petitioners had not obtained necessary approvals from state authorities to proceed with their proposed trials.\n\nThe Court noted that while the Petitioners were free to conduct research, they had not followed the required legal protocols, and the Ministry of Ayush had already established guidelines for Homoeopathic practitioners during the pandemic. The Court highlighted the importance of expert bodies like the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in determining medical protocols, especially during a public health crisis, and affirmed that the government had effectively managed the pandemic response, including the administration of over 219 crore vaccine doses.\n\nUltimately, the Court found no grounds to grant the relief sought by the Petitioners, stating that they could pursue their research within the framework of existing laws. The Writ Petition was therefore disposed of, allowing the Petitioners to conduct their drug trials in compliance with legal requirements."}
{"ID": "id_1464", "Summary": "In the case of Intezar Hussain Sayed versus Zee Studios and others, the petitioner, a resident of Uttar Pradesh, filed a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) against the scheduled release of the film \"The Kashmir Files\" on March 11, 2022. The petitioner contended that the film's trailer contained scenes that could potentially offend the religious sentiments of the Muslim community and incite communal violence. Consequently, the petitioner sought an order to remove the trailer from social media platforms, modify or delete discriminatory scenes, and requested the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) to scrutinize the film's dialogues before issuing a screening certificate.\n\nDuring the proceedings, the court inquired whether the CBFC had granted a certification for the film under Section 5A of the Cinematograph Act, 1952. The respondent's counsel, Mr. Kadam, presented a certificate dated November 3, 2021, confirming that the CBFC had permitted the film's screening, along with documentation of subsequent voluntary deletions and additions made before the film's release.\n\nThe court further questioned the petitioner regarding the pursuit of remedies available under Rule 32 of the Cinematograph (Certification) Rules, 1983, to which the petitioner’s counsel, Mr. Aswani, responded that such remedies were not efficacious and argued that the court should entertain the PIL despite the availability of an alternative remedy, emphasizing that Article 226 does not preclude the writ court's jurisdiction in public interest litigations.\n\nAdditionally, the court noted that the petitioner had not invoked the Right to Information Act, 2005, to verify the film's certification status. After hearing the arguments, the court referenced its previous judgment in a related case, Hiten Dhirajlal Mehta vs. Bhansali Production and others, which had dismissed similar concerns regarding another film, \"Gangubai Kathiawadi.\" The court found no merit in the current PIL, leading to its dismissal without costs, and consequently, the interim application for intervention was also disposed of."}

The court reviewed an order dated June 26, 2023, which acknowledged these difficulties and emphasized the need for the State Government and Municipal Corporation to take decisive actions to improve accessibility by allocating funds for infrastructure, equipment, and vehicles.\n\nThe learned Additional Government Pleader (AGP) highlighted the extensive nature of the task, indicating that a comprehensive assessment of all government buildings across Maharashtra was required before appropriate decisions could be made. However, the court noted the lack of evidence demonstrating any progress in gathering this information, urging both the State Government and the Municipal Corporation to document the steps taken thus far.\n\nGiven that the case has been pending since 2021 without significant advancements towards alleviating the hardships faced by physically challenged individuals, the court mandated a time-bound completion of the necessary assessments within eight weeks, with a report to be submitted to the court.\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Warunjikar brought to the court's attention the absence of accessible washroom facilities for wheelchair users in government offices and court buildings, particularly in the High Court of Mumbai. The court recognized the validity of this concern and requested the registry to develop a proposal to convert an existing washroom in the High Court into an accessible facility for orthopedically disabled individuals, ensuring that this matter is addressed promptly by the appropriate committee."}
{"ID": "id_1481", "Summary": "In the case of Prasanna Krishnaji Musale v. Mrs. Neelam Prasanna Musale, the Appellant, a husband, challenged the Family Court's judgment dated April 6, 2011, which dismissed his petition for divorce under Section 13(1)(i-a), (i-b), and (v) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, while partially allowing the Respondent wife's application under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005. The couple married on March 16, 2003, and the Appellant claimed that the Respondent suffered from tuberculosis and later tested positive for HIV, which caused him significant mental distress. Following a series of conflicts, the Respondent left the matrimonial home in February 2005 but was later brought back by the Appellant. However, due to familial discord, she was asked to return to her parents' home.\n\nThe Respondent contested the divorce petition, asserting that the HIV test results were negative and that the Appellant's allegations had caused her severe mental anguish and social stigma. She sought damages and accommodation through her application under the Domestic Violence Act. The Appellant's counsel argued for an irretrievable breakdown of the marriage, citing various Supreme Court precedents, while the Respondent's counsel contended that the Appellant failed to substantiate claims of cruelty and desertion.\n\nThe court found that the Appellant's evidence lacked specific details regarding alleged cruelty and that he admitted to no significant quarrels during their marriage. Furthermore, the Appellant did not produce the HIV test report to support his claims, while expert testimony indicated that the Respondent was not HIV positive. The court noted that the Appellant's actions compelled the Respondent to leave the matrimonial home, failing to establish the necessary elements of desertion.\n\nRegarding the claim of irretrievable breakdown, the court stated that the Appellant could not benefit from his own wrongdoing, particularly given the evidence that contradicted his claims. Ultimately, the Family Court's decision was upheld, and the appeal was dismissed, with the court affirming that the evidence was properly assessed and that the Appellant had not met the legal requirements for divorce under the cited sections of the Hindu Marriage Act. Consequently, all applications related to the appeal were deemed unnecessary and disposed of accordingly."}

State of U.P. and 13 Others, the petitioners, represented by counsel Jamil Ahamad Azmi, Anand Swaroop Gautam, Ashutosh Kumar Tiwari, and Dharmendra Singh, invoked the jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. They alleged that their son was murdered while in police custody during the night of December 11-12, 2020, in connection with Case Crime No. 1181 of 2020, which involved charges under Section 366 of the Indian Penal Code at Police Station Khurja Nagar, District Bulandshahar. The petitioners sought protection for their life and liberty, asserting that their son was subjected to torture and murder due to his inter-caste marriage, which he entered into of his own free will. \n\nThe petitioners contended that the authorities had been unjust in addressing their grievances, highlighting the necessity of a judicial inquiry as mandated by Section 176(1A) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) when a death occurs in police custody. They pointed out that no post-mortem examination had been conducted, and instead of following proper procedures, the police had cremated the body, violating established norms.\n\nThe learned Additional Government Advocate (AGA) acknowledged that a judicial inquiry was initiated on January 6, 2021, with a request to the District Judge, but the report was still pending. The Court emphasized the urgency and sensitivity required in cases of custodial death, stating that such inquiries should not be unduly delayed. Consequently, the Court directed the Registry to inquire with the District Judge of Bulandshahar regarding the status of the inquiry report and required an explanation from the Judicial Officer if the report had not been submitted, given that over a year had elapsed since the inquiry's initiation. The Court mandated that if the inquiry was still ongoing, it should be concluded expeditiously in accordance with legal procedures.

The respondent was the State of U.P., represented by counsel including C.S.C. and Dhiraj Singh.\n\nThe court addressed two civil miscellaneous intervenor applications from M/s Sainik Sweets Private Limited and others, requesting to be heard in the interest of justice. The court noted that, based on instructions dated October 1, 2020, no specific order was necessary at that time, but expressed hope that the police would promptly investigate criminal cases against the applicants.\n\nThe court acknowledged the Government of India’s guidelines mandating compliance from hotels, restaurants, and eateries during the COVID-19 pandemic. It commended the state and police for their swift actions against establishments violating these guidelines, which were established under the Uttar Pradesh Epidemic Disease Covid-19 Regulations, 2020. However, the court emphasized the need for ongoing vigilance.\n\nTo further control the pandemic, the court ordered that for six weeks, the state administration would regulate the operations of eateries, allowing them to function only under specific conditions. These conditions included maintaining social distancing, prohibiting customers from lingering outside, ensuring mask compliance within five yards of the premises, and mandating that eateries provide food in sealed containers. Additionally, it was stipulated that eateries with a daily turnover exceeding Rs. 5,000 should install CCTV cameras, and owners were empowered to report misbehaving customers to the police.\n\nThe court also directed that guidelines for mask and sanitizer manufacturing be developed in accordance with the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) standards. It noted that the Nagar Nigam, Prayagraj, had issued a notification reinforcing mask mandates for employees and visitors, with a \"No mask no entry\" policy.\n\nThe matter was scheduled for further review on October 7, 2020, at 2:00 P.M., where the court would consider reports from Advocate Commissioners regarding the operations of various wards."}

The police registered the FIR on March 1, 2020, after Ajay was shot and subsequently hospitalized. \n\nThe applicant's previous bail applications were denied by the Sessions Court and the High Court of Delhi, with the last rejection occurring on November 23, 2022. However, significant changes in circumstances were noted, including the applicant's prolonged custody and the granting of bail in related FIRs (Nos. 80/20, 91/20, 92/20, 117/20, and 120/20) by the High Court. The applicant's counsel argued for bail based on the principle of parity, citing similarities in evidence and circumstances across the FIRs.\n\nThe Investigating Officer opposed the bail application, asserting that the applicant was a key conspirator, had instigated rioters, and posed a threat to witnesses due to his influential status in the locality. The prosecution highlighted the risk of witness tampering and the potential for the applicant to abscond.\n\nUpon reviewing the records, the court acknowledged that the incidents in the related FIRs occurred in close temporal and spatial proximity, and that the High Court had previously assessed the merits of the case favorably for the applicant in other FIRs. The court concluded that the material change in circumstances warranted a different outcome for the bail application.\n\nConsequently, the court granted bail to Mohd.

The complaint was lodged by the Pragjyotishpur Aikya Sangha, Hojai District Youth Committee, alleging that the petitioners, involved with the magazine \"Nandini,\" published a distorted image of Goddess Durga, which purportedly hurt Hindu sentiments.\n\nThe court, having reviewed the petition and the FIR, noted that while the petitioners could not provide a certified copy of the FIR, they were granted interim protection pending further examination of the case diary.

{"ID": "id_1530", "Summary": "In the case of W.P.(C) 10638/2022, the petitioner, a minor represented by her father, sought permission for a medical termination of pregnancy (MTP) following a sexual assault incident that occurred on December 25, 2021. The petitioner, approximately 17 years old, was reported to be 24 weeks and a few days pregnant. After consulting a hospital on July 9, 2022, and being informed of the legal requirements, the petitioner filed this writ petition.\n\nOn July 18, 2022, the hospital constituted a Medical Board that reported the petitioner’s age as about 13 years and confirmed a gestation period of 25 weeks and 6 days. The Board opined that termination beyond 24 weeks is permissible only in cases of substantial fetal abnormalities, which were not present in this case, leading to their inability to proceed.\n\nThe Court noted that the Board's opinion did not consider the amendments made to the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971, under Act No. 8 of 2021, which allows for termination beyond 20 weeks in specific circumstances, including cases of rape. The Court emphasized that the anguish caused by a pregnancy resulting from rape is presumed to constitute a grave injury to the mental health of the pregnant woman, as per the Act's provisions.\n\nThe Court referenced a similar case, Surekha Gautam Khobragade vs. State of NCT of Delhi, where a termination was permitted at 26 weeks due to the mental anguish caused by the pregnancy. The Court also highlighted the importance of judicial discretion in exceptional cases where strict adherence to the Act may not suffice to protect the rights of the victim.\n\nAfter considering the facts, including the psychological trauma the petitioner would endure if forced to carry the pregnancy to term, the Court concluded that such an outcome would violate her right to life under Article 21 of the Constitution. Therefore, the Court allowed the writ petition, directing the respondent hospital to form a Medical Board to oversee the termination of the pregnancy, with the stipulation that the procedure could be canceled if any risk to the petitioner’s life arose during the process.\n\nAdditionally, the Court ordered the preservation of the terminal fetus for DNA testing related to the criminal case registered under Section 376 of the Indian Penal Code. The Medical Board's report was to be kept confidential and managed by the Deputy Registrar for future reference.\n\nIn summary, the Court recognized the exceptional circumstances of the case, allowing for the medical termination of pregnancy while ensuring the preservation of evidence for the ongoing criminal proceedings."}
{"ID": "id_154", "Summary": "In the case arising from Special Leave Petition (Crl.) No. 13485 of 2023, the Supreme Court of India granted leave and heard the arguments presented by the parties involved. The matter originated from First Information Report (FIR) No. 287/2019, which was registered on August 30, 2019, at Police Station Hapur Dehat, Uttar Pradesh, based on a complaint by Sanjay Garg, the respondent in this appeal. The complaint detailed that Garg, the proprietor of Garg Timber Products, supplied wood waste fuel worth ₹5,69,31,811 to Asar Eco Power Limited between December 1, 2015, and August 6, 2017. Despite receiving partial payment of ₹3,76,40,553, a balance of ₹1,92,91,358 remained unpaid, leading Garg to accuse the directors of Asar Eco Power Limited of fraud and extortion, claiming they threatened him and refused to pay the outstanding amount.\n\nFollowing the investigation, the police filed a charge sheet under Section 173 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which included allegations under Sections 406, 420, and 506 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The charge sheet reiterated the complaint and indicated that the appellants, Lalit Chaturvedi, Mukesh Sharma, and Manoj Chaturvedi, had obtained a stay on their arrest from the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad. The police concluded that the appellants had committed fraud and failed to return the owed amount, with threats made against Garg.\n\nThe Supreme Court highlighted the distinction between civil wrongs, such as breach of contract, and criminal offenses under the IPC. It referenced previous judgments emphasizing that a mere failure to pay a debt does not constitute a criminal offense unless there is evidence of deception or fraudulent intent at the time of the contract. The Court noted that the allegations made by Garg did not satisfy the necessary legal ingredients for the offenses charged, particularly under Section 420, which requires proof of deception and dishonest inducement.\n\nThe Court further clarified that the police do not possess the authority to recover money or act as a civil court, and that the initiation of criminal proceedings for the purpose of recovering a debt is an abuse of legal process. Consequently, the Supreme Court set aside the impugned judgment of the High Court, quashing the FIR and the resulting proceedings, including the charge sheet, while clarifying that the decision did not affect Garg's civil rights.\n\nThe appeal was allowed, and any pending applications were disposed of accordingly. The judgment was delivered on February 6, 2024, with the Court emphasizing the need for clarity in distinguishing between civil and criminal matters in similar cases."}

No(s). 2142-2143/2024 arising from SLP(C) No(s). 19629-19630/2023, the Supreme Court of India granted leave and addressed the issue of timely payment of legal fees for advocates representing the State of Uttar Pradesh. The Court noted the State's commitment to establish a mechanism ensuring prompt payment of these fees, emphasizing the importance of avoiding situations where advocates are compelled to seek judicial intervention for fee recovery, which could deter skilled lawyers from representing the State. The Court expressed hope for the implementation of a rational policy to facilitate timely payments.\n\nIn terms of financial implications, the Court addressed the interest payable amounting to Rs. 1,16,397/- as per the High Court's order. However, considering the unique circumstances of the case, the Court exercised its jurisdiction under Article 142 of the Constitution, reducing the interest to a lump sum of Rs. 50,000/-, to be paid by the State within six weeks, with a stipulation that failure to comply would incur interest at 8% per annum from the date of the order. The appeals were subsequently disposed of, along with any pending applications.\n\nIn C.A. No(s). 2144-2145/2024 related to SLP(C) No(s). 19999-20000/2023, the respondent had approached the High Court due to pending bills from December 2009 to December 2017, leading to a writ petition filed on 20.10.2022. Following the petition, the State paid Rs. 13,85,600/- as claimed by the respondent, but disputes arose regarding the interest amount, with the State asserting it to be Rs. 4,91,727/- while the respondent claimed Rs. 7,56,000/-.\n\nIn alignment with the reasoning provided in the earlier case, the Court again invoked Article 142, directing the State of Uttar Pradesh to pay a lump sum of Rs. 3,00,000/- towards interest within six weeks, with similar consequences for non-compliance as previously stated. The appeals were disposed of, and any pending applications were also resolved.\n\nThe matters were heard on 12-02-2024, with representation from both parties, leading to the Court's decision to grant leave and dispose of the appeals in accordance with the signed order."}
{"ID": "id_1588", "Summary": "In the Criminal Petition filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, by petitioners A1 (the father) and A2 (the paternal uncle), the court addressed the quashing of proceedings related to F.I.R. No. 305 of 2022 registered at Gooty Police Station for the alleged kidnapping of two minors, Md. Atheek Ahammad (10 years) and Md. Arshad Ahmmad (8 years), from their mother’s custody. The incident occurred on September 23, 2022, when the petitioners, along with four others, allegedly abducted the children while pushing aside their maternal grandfather.\n\nThe petitioners contended that even if the allegations were accepted as true, the offence under Section 363 IPC (kidnapping) would not apply, as they are governed by the Sunni School of Mohammedan law, which designates the father as the natural guardian of male children. Under this law, the mother retains custody of her male child only until he reaches the age of seven, after which the father assumes full guardianship. The petitioners argued that since A1 is the father, his actions in taking the children from their maternal grandparents do not constitute kidnapping.\n\nConversely, the respondent's counsel argued that the children were in the mother's custody, and thus, the father’s actions could be construed as kidnapping under Section 363 IPC. The respondent emphasized that the investigation was still in its early stages, necessitating further inquiry into the truth of the allegations.\n\nUpon reviewing the case, the court noted that Section 361 IPC defines kidnapping from lawful guardianship, which includes any person lawfully entrusted with the care of a minor. The court acknowledged that while the mother had custody rights until the children reached a certain age, she was not the natural guardian. The father, as the natural guardian, could not be criminally liable for taking the children from the mother’s custody, as he was merely asserting his legal rights.\n\nThe court referenced established legal principles from previous judgments, affirming that the father is the primary guardian under Mohammedan law, and the mother’s custody rights do not supersede the father’s legal guardianship. It was determined that the children were under the care of their maternal grandparents while their mother worked in Hyderabad, further supporting the father's position.\n\nUltimately, the court concluded that the allegations did not substantiate the charge of kidnapping against A1, and since A2 merely accompanied A1, no offence was established against him either. Consequently, the court allowed the Criminal Petition, quashing the proceedings against both petitioners in F.I.R. No. 305 of 2022, and closed any pending miscellaneous petitions related to the case. The judgment was delivered on April 17, 2023."}

This petition was filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, in light of a Compromise Deed dated August 28, 2023, which was executed between the parties involved.\n\nThe petition included the Compromise Deed and affidavits from all petitioners and respondent no. 2, along with identification proofs. During the court proceedings, petitioner nos. 1 and 2, along with respondent no. 2, were present and their identities were confirmed by the Investigating Officer. The learned Additional Public Prosecutor (APP) for the State acknowledged the notice and expressed no objection to the quashing of the FIR.\n\nRespondent no. 2 affirmed the Compromise Deed, indicating that he had voluntarily settled all disputes with the petitioners and did not wish to pursue the criminal proceedings against them. The court noted that the settlement between the parties rendered the continuation of the FIR unnecessary, referencing the precedents set by the Supreme Court in Gian Singh vs. State of Punjab and Narinder Singh vs. State of Punjab, which support the quashing of FIRs in cases of amicable settlements.\n\nConsequently, the court allowed the petition, quashing FIR No. 0434/2018 and all related proceedings, contingent upon the petitioners and respondent no. 2 each depositing a cost of Rs. 24,000, totaling Rs. 48,000. The petitioners agreed to pay their share in cash to respondent no. 2, who would then use the total amount for procuring uniform socks for police personnel across six designated police stations in equal shares.\n\nThe petition, along with any pending applications, was disposed of, with a compliance hearing scheduled for October 30, 2023."}

The petitioner, a coolie, was admitted to the Government Hospital in Mudukulathur on May 17, 2014, for labor, where she delivered a female child. However, the child developed asphyxia and was subsequently transferred to Government Hospital, Paramakudi, and later to Government Rajaji Hospital, Madurai, where she died on May 20, 2014.\n\nThe petitioner alleged that the child was born dead and that the medical staff's negligence, particularly the failure to perform a caesarean section, contributed to the child's death. Despite her claims, the respondents, including the doctors and hospital staff, denied any wrongdoing, asserting that the child was treated appropriately and that the decision for a normal delivery was justified based on medical assessments.\n\nThe court emphasized the importance of maintaining high standards of care in both public and private healthcare settings, referencing legal precedents that establish patients' rights to dignified treatment and access to medical records. It was noted that the failure to provide the petitioner with her medical records constituted a violation of her rights. However, the court found no evidence to support the claim that the child was born dead, as medical records from the hospitals indicated that treatment was provided and the child was alive at birth.\n\nUltimately, the court ruled that while the medical staff had not acted negligently, the lack of available ventilator support at the initial hospital and the failure to provide medical records warranted compensation. The petitioner was awarded ₹75,000, to be paid by the first respondent within eight weeks. The writ petition was partly allowed, with no order as to costs."}

The court directed him to email Dr. Sanjeev Singh detailing these errors, with an assurance from Dr. Singh that corrections would be made within two days, followed by the issuance of a rectified certificate online. Ms. Ramita Iyer, who required her online digital degree certificate for employment in Singapore, was informed that her application submitted on 10th August 2020 would be processed, and the certificate would be issued by 5th October 2020, contingent upon verification of her documents.\n\nThe court acknowledged an affidavit submitted by DU, which detailed the provision of transcripts and online degree certificates. It was noted that DU faced challenges in creating an online mechanism for students who graduated prior to 2017, although paper degrees had been dispatched to respective colleges. The court ordered DU to confirm whether all paper degrees for these students had been sent and to file an affidavit with this information.\n\nRegarding the issuance of online transcripts and mark sheets, DU expressed its inability to provide a regular mechanism but indicated a willingness to accommodate urgent requests for students needing them for foreign admissions or employment. The court requested that DU devise a mechanism for urgent transcript issuance and report on it by the next hearing.\n\nThe affidavit also outlined a timeline for the printing of paper degrees for students graduating from 2017 to 2020, with specific deadlines for each category. DU reported that it had received 1788 urgent applications for online degrees, of which 1728 had been issued, and efforts were underway to complete the remaining requests within 30 days.\n\nAdditionally, the court addressed the transmission of data to Digilocker, with Prof. D.S. Rawat indicating plans to begin this process to alleviate DU's workload. The court ordered DU to provide a timeline for this data transmission and reconsider its decision to levy charges for digital certificates.\n\nThe court ruled that both monolingual and bilingual formats of online digital degree certificates would be valid for submission to foreign universities and authorities. The matter was scheduled for further hearing on 20th October 2020, with DU required to file a compliance affidavit at least three days prior to the next hearing, detailing deadlines for paper degree issuance, mechanisms for urgent transcript requests, and timelines for data transmission to Digilocker."}
{"ID": "id_1622", "Summary": "In the case at hand, the applicants, including Sunita Kumari, Mamta Singh, Niraj Bhaskar, Nirmala Vyas, and Dipanjali Ram Sevak, filed an application under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Cr.P.C.) seeking to quash the First Information Report (FIR) registered as Crime No. 201/2022, which alleges offences under Sections 498-A, 323, 524 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act. The FIR and subsequent charge-sheet, Regular Criminal Case No. 2688/2022, are pending before the Court of Judicial Magistrate First Class in Nagpur.\n\nThe applicants contended that the FIR lacks specific allegations against them, asserting that they do not fall within the definition of \"relatives\" as per Section 498-A IPC, and highlighted that the complainant's husband did not file the application. They argued that the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate had previously closed domestic violence proceedings against one of the applicants, Sunita Kumari, due to lack of shared residence with the complainant.\n\nConversely, the learned Additional Public Prosecutor (APP) for the State argued that the FIR and witness statements provide sufficient material to frame charges against the applicants, indicating that they had subjected the complainant to humiliation and mental cruelty, which falls under the ambit of Section 498-A IPC. The court noted that mental cruelty can occur even from a distance and does not necessitate physical presence, referencing the Supreme Court's ruling in A. Jayachandra Vs. Annel Kaur, which recognized that derogatory remarks could constitute cruelty.\n\nThe court found that the allegations against the applicants, including threats made by Mamta Singh regarding her influence in the police, warranted a trial. It rejected the argument that the applicants, being distant relatives, could not be charged under Section 498-A IPC, clarifying that the term \"relative\" encompasses those related by blood, marriage, or adoption.\n\nUltimately, the court dismissed the application to quash the FIR, asserting that the allegations were substantial enough to proceed with the trial. The applicants were ordered to pay costs of ₹10,000 to the High Court Bar Association, Nagpur, for library development, with a stipulation that failure to pay would result in recovery as a fine. The court emphasized the necessity of allowing the case to be examined on its merits, thereby upholding the integrity of the judicial process."}
{"ID": "id_1634", "Summary": "In the matter concerning Bharat Singh, Advocate, the Hon'ble High Court addressed a serious contempt issue raised by a lady Judicial Officer from the Khurja court, who referred the matter under Section 15(2) of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971. The reference was made on 1st July 2022, citing alleged criminal contempt during court proceedings. The Court took cognizance of the matter on 1st August 2022, issuing notices to the contemnor and scheduling his appearance for 5th September 2022. However, the proceedings were adjourned multiple times due to the contemnor's failure to file a reply and the illness of his counsel.\n\nSubsequent communications from the Judicial Officer highlighted further contemptuous behavior by the contemnor, including insults and threats made on 20th and 21st December 2022, which prompted her to seek refuge in her Chambers for her safety. The Administrative Judge of Bulandshahr noted the Judicial Officer's vulnerable condition, emphasizing the need for her protection.\n\nDuring the latest hearing, the contemnor sought another adjournment to file his response, which was opposed by the High Court's Special Counsel, Sudhir Mehrotra. The Court expressed concern over the contemnor's dilatory tactics and irresponsible conduct, asserting that such intentional disrespect towards a lady Judicial Officer undermines the judicial system.\n\nConsequently, the Court invoked its jurisdiction under Chapter XXIV Rule 11(2) of the Allahabad High Court Rules, prohibiting the contemnor from practicing law in Uttar Pradesh until the next hearing. The Senior Superintendent of Police, Bulandshahr, was directed to ensure the safety of the Judicial Officer, with any further misconduct by the contemnor to be addressed according to the law. The matter is set for a follow-up on 12th January 2023, with a warning issued to the contemnor regarding his future conduct. The District Judge of Bulandshahr was also instructed to take necessary actions to safeguard the Judicial Officer and maintain the integrity of court proceedings. The registry was tasked with communicating these orders to relevant authorities for compliance."}
{"ID": "id_1659", "Summary": "In the appeals concerning bail for Manish Sisodia, the former Deputy Chief Minister of Delhi, the court examined prosecutions initiated by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Directorate of Enforcement (DoE) under various statutes, including the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, the Indian Penal Code, 1860, and the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002. Sisodia has been in custody since February and March 2023, facing serious charges including bribery and money laundering, with extensive documentation and numerous witnesses involved in the case.\n\nThe court noted that Sisodia's arguments for bail included the lengthy trial process, the substantial number of witnesses (294 for CBI and 162 for DoE), and the extensive documentation (approximately 56,000 pages). He contended that the new excise policy, which was implemented after thorough deliberation, was designed to benefit the public and was not a vehicle for corruption. Sisodia asserted that the allegations of kickbacks amounting to ₹100 crores were unfounded and based on hearsay, with co-accused individuals having retracted their statements.\n\nThe prosecution, however, argued that the new excise policy was crafted to facilitate kickbacks to wholesale distributors, with the commission rate increased from 5% to 12%, resulting in significant illegal profits. They claimed that this policy was a conspiracy to ensure unjust enrichment at the expense of the public exchequer, with evidence suggesting that proceeds of crime were funneled into political campaigns, including those of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which Sisodia is associated with.\n\nThe court highlighted that while Sisodia's prolonged detention was a concern, the serious nature of the allegations and the potential for evidence tampering justified the denial of bail at this stage. The court emphasized that the determination of bail should consider the risk of flight and the possibility of influencing witnesses, particularly given Sisodia's political stature.\n\nUltimately, the court ruled against granting bail, citing the gravity of the charges and the substantial evidence presented by the prosecution, while also acknowledging the need for a timely trial. The court's decision reflects a balance between the rights of the accused and the integrity of the judicial process in cases involving serious economic offenses."}
{"ID": "id_1671", "Summary": "In the matter before the Gujarat High Court, the learned advocates for the parties presented their arguments regarding the State Government's vaccination strategy and health measures in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The Court acknowledged the affidavit submitted by the Under Secretary of the Department of Health and Family Welfare, which was in response to the Court's earlier order dated May 26, 2021.\n\nMr. Percy Kavina, representing the Gujarat High Court Advocates’ Association, expressed concerns over the lack of clarity from the State Government regarding the vaccination schedule, specifically the timing and quantity of vaccine deliveries. He highlighted inconsistencies in the recommended time-gap between vaccine doses, which has fluctuated from six to sixteen weeks, urging the State to provide definitive guidelines. Additionally, Mr. Kavina noted that the affidavit did not adequately address the State's actions concerning the treatment of patients suffering from mucormycosis.\n\nMr. A.J. Yagnik, representing the applicants in Civil Applications No. 11/2021 and No. 22/2021, raised issues regarding the vaccination of vulnerable populations, including inmates of juvenile homes and old age homes. He criticized the State Government for failing to take substantial action beyond issuing a circular, pointing out that the affidavit-in-reply did not address several concerns raised in the Civil Applications.\n\nIn response, Advocate General Mr. Kamal Trivedi asserted that the State Government had issued a circular on May 21, 2021, prioritizing the vaccination of the groups mentioned by Mr. Yagnik and emphasized that vaccination efforts were ongoing. He explained that the vaccine manufacturers had not provided a supply schedule, complicating the State's ability to present detailed vaccination data.\n\nThe Court underscored the necessity for the State to enhance health infrastructure in anticipation of a potential third wave of the pandemic, expected around October-November 2021, and urged the administration to implement rigorous testing, tracing, and treatment protocols. The State was instructed to submit an action plan to address these concerns.\n\nThe matter is scheduled for further hearing on July 2, 2021, at 2:30 PM, to resolve any outstanding issues."}
{"ID": "id_1675", "Summary": "In the case of Uttamrao Rambhaji Shelke and Nikhil Manohar Dorle versus the State of Maharashtra and others, the petitioners sought to quash the order dated September 16, 2021, which appointed members to the Managing Committee of the Shree Sai Baba Sansthan Trust, Shirdi. The petitioners argued that the appointments violated the Shree Sai Baba Sansthan Trust (Shirdi) Act, 2004, particularly regarding the qualifications and categories of members mandated by the Act.\n\nThe petitioners, both devotees of the Sansthan Trust, contended that the appointed members were predominantly politicians with questionable qualifications and backgrounds, undermining the integrity of the Trust. They highlighted that the appointments did not comply with the statutory requirements, including the need for representation from women and socially disadvantaged groups, as well as professionals with relevant expertise.\n\nThe court examined the history of the Sansthan Trust, established to manage the affairs of the shrine and its properties, and noted that the State Government had previously been directed to ensure that appointments were made transparently and based on merit, rather than political affiliations. The court found that the recent appointments were made without adherence to these principles, as many appointees had political ties and some had criminal backgrounds.\n\nUltimately, the court quashed the September 16 order, directing the State Government to reconstitute the Managing Committee in compliance with the Act and the court's previous rulings. An ad-hoc committee, comprising the Principal District Judge, the Collector, and the Chief Executive Officer of the Trust, was appointed to oversee the Trust's affairs until a new committee was established. The court emphasized the need for the management of the Trust to be free from political influence and to prioritize the interests of the devotees and the public.\n\nThe judgment underscores the importance of maintaining the integrity of religious trusts and ensuring that their management is conducted in a manner that reflects the values and principles associated with the faith they represent."}

An FIR was initially registered by the Gamdevi Police Station regarding a suspicious SUV laden with gelatine, leading to investigations by the Anti-Terrorist Squad and later the National Investigation Agency (NIA).\n2. Allegations against Anil Deshmukh arose from a letter by Param Bir Singh, the then Commissioner of Police, which prompted Dr. Jaishri Patil to file a complaint.\n3. Multiple petitions were filed in the Supreme Court and High Court, seeking independent investigations into the alleged corrupt practices of Deshmukh.\n4. The High Court directed the CBI to conduct a preliminary inquiry into the allegations, emphasizing the need for an impartial investigation due to the serious nature of the claims.\n\n**Legal Arguments:**\n- The State contended that the CBI's investigation exceeded the scope of the High Court's order, particularly concerning the reinstatement of Sachin Vaze and the transfer of police officials, which were not part of the original complaint.\n- The CBI argued that these matters were intrinsically linked to the allegations against Deshmukh and necessary for a comprehensive investigation.\n\n**Judgment:**\nThe High Court dismissed the petition, affirming that the CBI was within its rights to investigate the broader context of the allegations, including the reinstatement of Vaze and the transfer of police officials, as they were relevant to the alleged conspiracy and corruption. The Court emphasized the importance of restoring public confidence in law enforcement and the necessity of an independent investigation into serious allegations against high-ranking officials.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe Court upheld the CBI's authority to investigate the matters related to the FIR, reinforcing the principle that investigations must be thorough and impartial, especially in cases involving public officials. The petition by the State of Maharashtra was dismissed, allowing the CBI to proceed with its investigation without interference."}

No.3184/2022, the appellant, represented by Mr. Manu Minocha, challenges the Family Court's order dated 01.04.2021, which dismissed his divorce petition filed under Section 13(1)(ia) of the Hindu Marriage Act. The Family Court dismissed the petition on the grounds that the appellant failed to present evidence, subsequently closing his right to do so. The appellant's counsel argued that the parties were engaged in settlement negotiations, which led to repeated requests for time from the Court, resulting in the absence of affidavits as evidence.\n\nMr. Rajesh Yadav, the senior counsel for the respondent, acknowledged the appellant's account as accurate. The Court expressed dismay at the Family Court's approach, emphasizing that the judicial process should not merely aim to dispose of cases at the expense of justice. The Court highlighted that the Family Courts are expected to facilitate settlements, and given the parties' ongoing negotiations, the Family Court should have granted the adjournment request instead of prematurely closing the appellant's right to present evidence and dismissing the petition.\n\nConsequently, the Court set aside the Family Court's order and restored the divorce petition (HMA No.116/2019). Both counsels agreed to refer the parties for mediation, directing them to appear before the Delhi High Court Mediation & Conciliation Centre on 20.01.2022 at 03:00 p.m., with the mediation report to be submitted to the Family Court.

The report highlighted the Uttarakhand government's decision to suspend the yatra amid fears of a potential third wave of COVID-19, particularly in light of the recent detection of the Delta Plus variant. Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami emphasized the prioritization of human life in this decision, stating that extensive discussions with officials and neighboring states led to the conclusion that Haridwar should not become a pandemic hotspot.\n\nIn contrast, Uttar Pradesh was preparing to proceed with the yatra, albeit with restrictions, as indicated by UP Additional Director General (ADG) Law and Order, Prashant Kumar. The last organized yatra in 2019 saw approximately 3.5 crore devotees visiting Haridwar, raising concerns about the implications of large gatherings during the ongoing pandemic.\n\nThe Court noted the urgency of the situation, particularly given the imminent start date of the yatra on July 25, 2021, and mandated that affidavits addressing the news report be submitted by the relevant Secretaries of the Union and both states by the morning of July 16, 2021.

{"ID": "id_1739", "Summary": "**Legal Summary:**\n\nThe petitioner, Anish Pramod Patel, filed a petition under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, seeking to quash a summoning order dated March 12, 2019, issued under Section 31(1) of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 (PWDV Act). This order was related to the non-compliance of an interim maintenance order in the case titled *Kiran Jyot Maini v. Anish Pramod Patel*. The marriage between the petitioner and the respondent was solemnized on April 30, 2015, and subsequent to their separation, the respondent filed an FIR against the petitioner under various sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Dowry Prohibition Act.\n\nThe High Court of Allahabad initially intervened, referring the matter to mediation and staying the arrest of the petitioner. However, the mediation failed, leading the respondent to file a criminal application under Section 31(1) of the PWDV Act for the petitioner’s non-compliance with the maintenance order. The learned Additional Sessions Judge modified the interim maintenance amount, which the petitioner contested through various applications, including one under Section 482 of Cr.P.C., which was dismissed as infructuous after the cases were transferred to Delhi.\n\nThe petitioner argued that the summoning order was issued without proper consideration, asserting that Section 31(1) applies only to breaches of protection orders under Section 18 of the PWDV Act, not to monetary reliefs. The respondent contended that the petitioner had failed to comply with the maintenance orders, thus justifying the summoning order.\n\nThe Court examined the statutory framework of the PWDV Act, noting that Section 31 specifically addresses breaches of protection orders and does not encompass monetary reliefs, which are governed by Section 20. The Court emphasized that the intent of the PWDV Act is to provide immediate relief to victims of domestic violence, not to impose criminal penalties for non-payment of maintenance. \n\nUltimately, the Court concluded that the petitioner could not be summoned under Section 31 for failing to comply with a monetary order. Consequently, the Court quashed the summoning order dated March 12, 2019, and all related proceedings pending before the Mahila Court in Delhi, thereby disposing of the petition.

{"ID": "id_1744", "Summary": "In the case at hand, the petitioner challenged the order dated June 28, 2023, issued by the Additional District Magistrate (respondent no.1), which dismissed the petitioner's application under Section 14 of the Securitization and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 (SARFAESI Act). The petitioner, engaged in providing loans, had extended a loan of ₹97,78,740 to respondents no. 2 to 5, who secured the loan with an equitable mortgage on a property located in Indore. Due to irregular repayments, the loan account was classified as a Non-Performing Asset (NPA), prompting the petitioner to seek possession of the mortgaged property.\n\nThe petitioner initially filed an application under Section 14 of the SARFAESI Act with the District Magistrate, which was subsequently transferred to the Additional District Magistrate. However, instead of facilitating the possession, the Additional District Magistrate issued notices to the borrowers, allowing them to defend against the application. This led the petitioner to file a writ petition (W.P. No. 10672/2023), which was allowed, directing the Additional District Magistrate to decide the application without granting a hearing to the borrowers. Despite this directive, the Additional District Magistrate failed to comply, leading the petitioner to file a contempt petition.\n\nOn June 28, 2023, the Additional District Magistrate rejected the application, citing that the respondents had filed a SARFAESI application before the Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT) in Jabalpur, rendering her functus officio. The petitioner contended that the Additional District Magistrate exceeded her jurisdiction by adjudicating the rights of the parties rather than merely determining the territorial jurisdiction and the issuance of notice under Section 13(2) of the SARFAESI Act.\n\nThe court reiterated that the powers under Section 14 of the SARFAESI Act are executory and ministerial, not adjudicatory. It emphasized that the Additional District Magistrate had previously overstepped her authority and failed to comply with the court's orders. Consequently, the court quashed the impugned order and directed the Additional District Magistrate to reconsider the application in accordance with the law within a specified timeframe, while imposing a cost of ₹10,000 on her for wasting the court's time. The court also mandated that the cost be paid personally by the Additional District Magistrate, not by the state, and instructed that the order be circulated among relevant officials to prevent future misinterpretations of judicial directives."}

The earlier judgments suggested that mere membership in a banned organization does not constitute a criminal offense unless there is evidence of violence or incitement to violence.\n\n**Key Legal Issues:**\n1. Whether the judgments in *Raneef* and *Arup Bhuyan* correctly interpreted the requirement of \"active membership\" in relation to the UAPA.\n2. The appropriateness of relying on American legal precedents concerning freedom of speech and association in the Indian context.\n3. The constitutionality of Section 10(a)(i) of the UAPA and its implications for fundamental rights under Articles 19 and 21 of the Indian Constitution.\n\n**Court's Findings:**\n- The Court emphasized that the principle of \"guilt by association\" is not applicable in India as it is in the U.S. legal system. The mere membership in a banned organization does not automatically imply criminality unless there is an overt act of violence or incitement.\n- The Court reiterated that the UAPA was enacted to safeguard the sovereignty and integrity of India, and thus, the provisions must be interpreted in light of national security concerns.\n- The judgments in *Raneef* and *Arup Bhuyan* were found to have erred in their reliance on U.S. Supreme Court decisions without adequately considering the distinct constitutional framework of India, particularly the reasonable restrictions permitted under Article 19(2) and (4).\n- The Court concluded that the Union of India should have been given an opportunity to present its case in the earlier judgments, as the interpretation of the UAPA could significantly impact national security.\n\n**Final Ruling:**\nThe Supreme Court overruled the previous interpretations in *Raneef* and *Arup Bhuyan*, stating that mere membership in a banned organization is sufficient for prosecution under Section 10(a)(i) of the UAPA. The Court held that the provisions of the UAPA are constitutional and do not violate the fundamental rights guaranteed under the Indian Constitution.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reference was answered affirmatively, affirming the validity of Section 10(a)(i) of the UAPA and clarifying that the mere membership of a banned organization constitutes an offense, thereby reinforcing the legislative intent to combat unlawful activities effectively. The matter was directed back to the appropriate bench for further proceedings."}
{"ID": "id_1766", "Summary": "In the case of Latabai D/o Maharu Koli @ Latabai W/o Chandrakant Sonawane versus the State of Maharashtra and others, the petitioner, a 51-year-old elected Member of the Legislative Assembly, challenged the decision of the Scheduled Tribe Certificate Scrutiny Committee, which invalidated her claim to the \"Tokre Koli\" Scheduled Tribe on February 9, 2022. The petitioner had previously been elected as a Corporator for the Jalgaon Municipal Corporation on a Scheduled Tribe reserved seat, and her caste certificate was submitted for validation.\n\nThe Committee's decision stemmed from a lack of response to a Vigilance Report that questioned her caste claim. Despite a court order directing her to resubmit her tribe certificate and expedite the validation process, the Committee ultimately invalidated her claim on November 4, 2020, citing insufficient evidence. The petitioner contested this ruling through multiple writ petitions, which were met with various procedural challenges and objections from respondent Jagdishchandra Valvi, who contested her caste claim.\n\nThe petitioner presented 61 documents, including pre- and post-independence school admission records and birth and death certificates of relatives, to substantiate her claim. However, the Vigilance Cell's report indicated numerous contra entries in the birth and death records, predominantly showing the caste as \"Koli,\" which contradicted her claim of belonging to the \"Tokre Koli\" tribe. The Committee concluded that the petitioner failed to prove her tribal affiliation, emphasizing the weight of the birth and death records over school documents.\n\nThe petitioner argued that the Committee improperly prioritized the quantity of evidence over its quality and failed to adequately consider her historical documents. However, the respondents contended that the evidence presented by the petitioner was insufficient and that the Committee's findings were justified based on the available records.\n\nUltimately, the court upheld the Committee's decision, affirming that the petitioner did not establish her claim to the \"Tokre Koli\" tribe. The ruling emphasized the importance of documentary evidence, particularly from official records, and concluded that the petitioner had not met the burden of proof required to validate her caste claim. The petition was dismissed, with no costs awarded, and any interim relief previously granted was extended for four weeks."}

{"ID": "id_1772", "Summary": "In the case concerning the Indian Military Nursing Services Ordinance, 1943, the petitioners challenged the constitutionality of Section 6, which mandated 100% reservation for women in the cadre of nursing officers. The petitioners argued that this provision violated Articles 14, 16(2), and 21 of the Constitution of India, asserting that while Article 15(3) allows for special provisions for women, it cannot override the guarantees provided under Article 16(2) regarding employment under the State.\n\nThe Union of India contended that the petition had become infructuous due to the completion of the recruitment process and the petitioners exceeding the age limit for application. However, the court overruled this objection, emphasizing that the petitioners had a valid cause of action at the time of filing and that dismissing the petition would leave the constitutional question unresolved.\n\nThe court examined the legal framework surrounding Articles 14, 15, and 16, noting that while Article 15(3) permits special provisions for women, it must not render Article 16(2) illusory. The court highlighted that the classification based solely on gender in Section 6 did not meet the twin tests of reasonable classification and rational nexus with the objective sought to be achieved. It further noted that the historical context of the Ordinance, enacted during World War II, no longer justified the exclusive reservation for women, as the emergency conditions that necessitated such measures had long since passed.\n\nThe court also addressed the argument that the Ordinance was protected under Article 33, which allows Parliament to modify rights conferred by Part III of the Constitution for armed forces personnel. It concluded that the Ordinance, being promulgated by the British Crown and later adapted, did not qualify as a law made by Parliament under Article 33.\n\nUltimately, the court declared Section 6 of the Ordinance unconstitutional, stating that the exclusive reservation for women violated the rights guaranteed under Articles 14 and 16(2). However, it clarified that this ruling would not invalidate past appointments made under the Ordinance, ensuring that the rights accrued to individuals under the law remained intact. The court allowed the petition in part, striking down the provision while preserving the validity of prior appointments and directing that any future applications by the petitioners would exclude the time spent in litigation from the age calculation for eligibility."}
{"ID": "id_1778", "Summary": "In the case of S.B. Criminal Miscellaneous (Petition) No. 3314/2021, the petitioners, Smt. Maya Devi and Banshi Lal, sought protection for their life and personal liberty under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) due to threats from private respondents arising from their relationship. The petition was prompted by the petitioner's claim that she had been compelled to leave her matrimonial home and was currently living with Banshi Lal, which had led to threats against them.\n\nDuring the proceedings, the court noted inconsistencies in a previous order dated 10.08.2021 and allowed for a modification. The petitioners' counsel argued for police protection, citing the danger to their lives. However, the Public Prosecutor opposed this request. The court, referencing a legal precedent from the Allahabad High Court in Smt. Aneeta & Anr. Vs. State of U.P. & Ors., emphasized that while live-in relationships are recognized, they should not undermine the social fabric of the country. Consequently, the court rejected the petitioners' request for police protection, stating that they could lodge a First Information Report (FIR) if any offense was committed against them.\n\nThe petition was ultimately dismissed, and the court ordered the removal of the earlier order from the website, instructing that any certified copies of the previous order be returned to the office for a fresh copy of the current order to be issued."}
{"ID": "id_1782", "Summary": "In the case of Suchitra vs. The Foreigners Regional Registration Office Goa and others, the petitioner, Ms. Olga Rosnina, challenged the deportation order dated May 17, 2023, and the subsequent denial of her dependency visa application made on February 7, 2023. The deportation order was based on alleged violations of the conditions of her E-VISA, which allowed her to stay in India. The petitioner contended that she had not violated any terms and argued that the deportation order was made without adhering to the principles of natural justice and fair play.\n\nDuring the hearing, Mr. A. D. Bhobe, representing the petitioner, emphasized that the drastic measure of deportation should not have been taken without proper inquiry or clarification from the petitioner regarding the alleged violations. He highlighted that the principles of natural justice, as enshrined in Article 14 of the Constitution of India, protect both citizens and non-citizens, and that the Central Government's powers in deportation matters must be exercised fairly.\n\nIn contrast, Mr. P. Faldessai, representing the respondents, maintained that the deportation was justified due to the purported breach of E-VISA conditions, asserting that the deportation order precluded any consideration of the dependency visa application.\n\nThe court found that the deportation order lacked the necessary compliance with natural justice principles, particularly since the petitioner had claimed no violations of her visa terms. The court noted that the situation did not involve threats to national security, and a mere allegation of a breach warranted further inquiry before such a severe action as deportation was taken. Consequently, the court set aside the deportation order and also quashed the denial of the dependency visa application, directing the respondents to expeditiously decide on the dependency visa application within two months. The petitioner was granted protection from deportation pending this decision, provided she complied with the existing terms of her stay in India. The court ordered that the decision be communicated to the petitioner within fifteen days, and the rule was made absolute without costs."}

Civil Writ Petition No. 7349/2021, the petitioner, Lava Kumar Sharma, a Senior Teacher (Mathematics) at Government Senior Secondary School Babedi, Bansur, District Alwar, challenged his suspension ordered on June 18, 2021, by the State of Rajasthan and its education department officials. The suspension was based on allegations that Sharma had sent messages via WhatsApp that were deemed disrespectful towards the State Government and a specific political party, violating the norms expected of a government servant under Rule 13 of the Rajasthan Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeals) Rules, 1958.\n\nSharma's counsel argued that the messages did not constitute misconduct warranting suspension or inquiry, asserting that the content of the messages did not criticize the government or its policies. The counsel emphasized that the petitioner’s right to express views under Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India should not be infringed upon by such actions. Citing several judgments, including *Vijay Shankar Pandey Vs. Union of India* and *Shreya Singhal Vs. Union of India*, the counsel contended that criticism of executive actions does not amount to misconduct.\n\nThe Rajasthan Civil Services Appellate Tribunal had previously refused to grant an ex-parte interim order and scheduled a hearing for July 27, 2021. However, the petitioner argued that the Tribunal failed to consider relevant legal precedents during the stay application hearing. \n\nThe High Court, upon reviewing the case, issued a notice for the writ petition and the stay application, scheduled for return on August 23, 2021. In the interim, the court stayed the effect of the suspension order, allowing Sharma to continue his duties at the school. Furthermore, the Tribunal was restrained from proceeding with the appeal, indicating that the matter warranted further judicial consideration."}

The episode featured derogatory comments about Pakistani people, including claims that all Pakistani individuals are terrorists and abusive language directed at them. Following viewer complaints, Ofcom investigated the broadcast.\n\n**Breach Findings:**\nOfcom determined that the program violated several rules of the Ofcom Broadcasting Code:\n- **Rule 2.3:** Material that may cause offense must be justified by context.\n- **Rule 3.2:** Hate speech must not be included unless justified by context.\n- **Rule 3.3:** Abusive or derogatory treatment of individuals or groups must not be included unless justified by context.\n\nThe content was found to contain uncontextualized hate speech and was deemed potentially highly offensive, particularly in the context of heightened tensions between India and Pakistan.\n\n**Arguments:**\nWorldview Media Network Limited argued that the statements made were figures of speech and that the program aimed to promote peace. They acknowledged the breach but claimed it was unintentional and expressed regret. They implemented measures to prevent future occurrences, including ceasing live debates on sensitive topics and enhancing content review processes.\n\n**Decision:**\nOfcom imposed a financial penalty of £20,000, directed the Licensee to broadcast a statement of Ofcom’s findings, and prohibited the repetition of the offending program. The decision emphasized the seriousness of the breaches, the potential harm caused, and the need for deterrence in broadcasting standards.\n\n**Legal Framework:**\nThe decision was made under the Communications Act 2003, which mandates Ofcom to protect the public from offensive material in broadcasting. The Human Rights Act 1998 and the Equality Act 2010 were also considered, ensuring that the Licensee's right to freedom of expression was balanced against the need to prevent hate speech and discrimination.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOfcom's decision reflects a commitment to uphold broadcasting standards and protect viewers from hate speech, particularly in sensitive geopolitical contexts. The imposed sanctions serve as a warning to broadcasters regarding the serious implications of failing to adhere to the Broadcasting Code."}

The FIR, filed by Anil Kumar, claims that Nadeem, an active member of the Popular Front of India (PFI), incited communal tension by asserting that Muslims must protect the Babri Masjid site due to the temple foundation ceremony at Ayodhya.\n\nNadeem's counsel, Aftab Ahmad and Yusuf Uz Zaman Safwi, contended that the allegations are fabricated and stem from Nadeem's prior legal actions against police misconduct. They argued that the FIR lacks credible evidence, as no specific individuals corroborate the claims against him, and emphasized Nadeem's reputation as a social activist focused on education and community upliftment. They also noted that the previous anticipatory bail application was unjustly denied without proper consideration of the facts.\n\nConversely, the Additional Government Advocate, Rajesh Kumar Singh, opposed the bail, asserting that Nadeem's actions were serious and indicative of a pattern of behavior aimed at disturbing communal harmony. He highlighted that the investigation revealed substantial evidence against Nadeem, who is not merely a member but an office bearer of PFI, necessitating custodial interrogation for a thorough investigation.\n\nThe court, after reviewing the FIR and the arguments presented, found that the allegations against Nadeem prima facie fulfill the criteria for an offence under Section 153A IPC, which requires intent to incite enmity between communities. The court emphasized that freedom of speech does not permit the dissemination of messages that could harm the religious sentiments of others. Consequently, the anticipatory bail application was rejected, with the court clarifying that its observations were solely for the purpose of this application and would not influence the ongoing investigation or trial."}

Vishwanathan and Mr. Rahul Kaushik, contested the High Court's directive for a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) inquiry into the operations of all nursing colleges in the state since 2017. This directive followed a report from a ten-member committee appointed by the M.P. Nursing Council, which inspected 271 nursing colleges as per Clause 8 of the Madhya Pradesh Nursing Shikshan Sanstha Manyatha Niyam, 2018. The committee's findings indicated that 201 colleges, including those operated by the petitioners, met the necessary standards, while 70 colleges did not.\n\nThe petitioners argued that the High Court's order for a CBI investigation was unwarranted given the committee's clearance of their institutions. The Supreme Court, upon hearing the arguments, issued a notice returnable on 29.11.2022 and stayed the effect and operation of the High Court's judgments and orders dated 27.09.2022 and 28.09.2022 in Writ Petition No. 25986/2021, as well as related matters, specifically concerning the colleges that had been cleared by the committee.

State of Punjab and others, decided on October 3, 2023, the petitioners sought a writ of mandamus to ensure their protection from threats posed by the private respondents, who are relatives of petitioner No. 1. The petitioners, who are in a romantic relationship, expressed their intention to marry; however, the family of petitioner No. 1 is opposed to this union and has allegedly threatened them with violence, including potential murder.\n\nPetitioner No. 1, born on August 31, 2002, and petitioner No. 2, born on April 12, 2005, have been living together in a live-in relationship and plan to marry once petitioner No. 2 reaches the legal marriageable age. Despite their attempts to seek protection from the Senior Superintendent of Police, Amritsar, through a representation dated August 6, 2023, no action was taken, prompting the filing of this writ petition.\n\nThe court emphasized that the core issue is not the legality of the petitioners' marriage but the fundamental right to life and liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. The court reaffirmed that the State has a constitutional obligation to protect the life and liberty of all citizens, regardless of their age or marital status. The judgment referenced previous cases where protection was granted to couples in similar situations, highlighting that living together without marriage does not negate the right to protection from harm.\n\nThe court cited several precedents, including Seema Kaur v. State of Punjab and others, which established that protection must be afforded to individuals in live-in relationships, irrespective of their marital status. The court also noted the societal issue of honor killings, particularly in northern India, and underscored the State's duty to safeguard individuals who choose their partners against familial opposition.\n\nIn conclusion, the court directed the Senior Superintendent of Police, Amritsar, to assess the threat to the petitioners and provide necessary protection for their life and liberty, thereby upholding their constitutional rights."}
{"ID": "id_1827", "Summary": "In the review petition R.P.No.936 of 2021, the court addressed the rights of Muslim women to unilaterally initiate divorce through khula, challenging traditional interpretations that subordinate these rights to male consent. The case arose from an appeal by a husband against a divorce decree granted to his wife under the Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939. The court reaffirmed that the right to khula is absolute and derived from the Quran, emphasizing that it does not require the husband's approval.\n\nThe review petition focused on procedural aspects of invoking khula, with the husband arguing that a wife must first seek talaq from her husband, and only upon refusal can she approach a qazi or court. The court, however, clarified that the Quran explicitly grants women the right to terminate their marriage, and the procedure for khula should not be conflated with talaq, which is a unilateral right of the husband.\n\nThe court outlined three conditions for a valid khula: the wife's declaration of termination, an offer to return the dower, and prior attempts at reconciliation. It emphasized that the legal framework must respect the Quranic injunctions, which prioritize the wife's autonomy in divorce matters. The court distinguished between the roles of Islamic scholars and legal authorities, asserting that legal interpretations must be grounded in the Quran and not solely in traditional practices.\n\nThe court also discussed the historical context of divorce rights in pre-Islamic Arabia, noting that women had the ability to initiate divorce, a right that was later codified in Islamic law. It highlighted the importance of conciliation and the role of third parties in divorce proceedings, while maintaining that the right to khula is a personal right of the wife that does not depend on the husband's consent.\n\nUltimately, the court rejected the review petition, affirming its previous ruling that Muslim women possess the right to initiate khula independently, thereby reinforcing their legal autonomy in marital matters. The court acknowledged the contributions of Advocate Hussain C.S., who provided insights during the proceedings, despite the court's disagreement with his views on procedural requirements."}

The court reviewed the petition, the supporting affidavit, and its previous order dated November 17, 2023, while hearing arguments from the respondents, represented by M/S. Nirmal S. and K. Remiya.\n\nThe court noted the distressing findings of the District Legal Services Authority (DLSA) report from Thiruvananthapuram, particularly concerning the young woman involved, who has recently turned 18. The Government Pleader, Smt. Vidya Kuriakose, informed the court that the young woman, having completed her education up to the 10th grade, is no longer studying and expresses a strong desire to return to her home state of Punjab, feeling abandoned and destitute in Kerala.\n\nIn contrast, the petitioners' counsel, Sri S. Nirmal, argued that despite their efforts to integrate with their adopted daughter, she has struggled to identify with her adoptive status, leading to the current situation. The court recognized the serious legal and factual complexities of the case, noting that the young woman is now an adult residing in a women's home, raising questions about the applicability of the cited legal provisions post-majority. Additionally, the court expressed concerns regarding her safety and protection if she were to return to Punjab, as well as her future prospects regarding career and marriage.\n\nTo address these issues, the court appointed Smt.

{"ID": "id_1860", "Summary": "In the case of Deepak Prakash Singh @ Deepak Singh versus the State of U.P., the applicant sought anticipatory bail in connection with Case Crime No. 0139 of 2023, which involved serious charges under Sections 354 and 376 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Sections 7/8 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, as well as the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act (SC/ST Act). The application was contested on the grounds of maintainability due to the bars imposed by Sections 18 and 18A of the SC/ST Act and Section 438(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.), which restrict anticipatory bail in such cases.\n\nThe applicant's counsel argued that the provisions of the POCSO Act should prevail over the SC/ST Act in cases involving both statutes, citing the Supreme Court's ruling in Prithvi Raj Chauhan Vs. Union of India, which allows for anticipatory bail if the allegations appear to be misconceived or made with malafide intent. The court also referenced the case of Rinku Vs. State of UP, affirming that the POCSO Act's procedures should be followed when both acts are applicable.\n\nThe court found the objections regarding the maintainability of the bail application to be unsustainable, as the Special Court under the POCSO Act had jurisdiction over the bail plea, despite the charges under the SC/ST Act. \n\nOn the merits, the FIR alleged that the applicant had molested the informant's minor daughter, who was 14 years and eight months old and mentally retarded. The applicant denied the allegations, claiming he was falsely implicated due to a personal rivalry with the informant's family. He argued that the FIR was filed with undue delay and lacked credible evidence linking him to the crime.\n\nThe prosecution opposed the bail application, emphasizing the victim's statements recorded under Sections 161 and 164 Cr.P.C., which supported the allegations. They highlighted the serious nature of the charges, particularly given the victim's age and mental condition, and argued that the absence of medical evidence for rape did not negate the possibility of the crime occurring.\n\nUltimately, the court concluded that the gravity of the accusations, the nature of the crime against a minor, and the role of the applicant as a teacher warranted the rejection of the anticipatory bail application. The court emphasized the need for accountability in such serious offenses to deter future incidents, thereby rejecting the application under Section 438 Cr.P.C."}

The petitioners requested that the inquiry be completed within two days, allowing their marriage to be registered by January 13, 2023, or alternatively, before January 23, 2023, if the marriage officer deemed it appropriate to proceed without the mandatory 30-day waiting period stipulated in Section 5 of the Act.\n\nThe first petitioner, a construction supervisor in Oman, returned to Kerala on December 10, 2022, and needed to return to Muscat by January 24, 2023, as his leave would expire on January 25, 2023. The second petitioner, a former teacher in Italy, could only accompany him after securing a visa, contingent upon their marriage being solemnized by January 13, 2023. The petitioners argued that the 30-day waiting period was unconstitutional or, at the very least, directory rather than mandatory, citing changes in societal norms and advancements in technology that could facilitate quicker verification of eligibility to marry.\n\nCounsel for the petitioners referenced a Division Bench decision from the Allahabad High Court, which allowed for the possibility of waiving the notice publication requirement under Section 6 of the Act, thereby expediting the marriage process. They also highlighted the Supreme Court's progressive stance in similar contexts, such as relaxing waiting periods in the Hindu Marriage Act.\n\nIn contrast, the learned Deputy Solicitor General (DSG) and Government Pleader contended that the 30-day waiting period serves a crucial purpose by allowing for objections to be raised against the proposed marriage. They cited precedents affirming the mandatory nature of this waiting period, including the case of Deepak Krishna v. District Registrar, which upheld the necessity of adhering to the statutory timeline.\n\nThe court acknowledged the need for a detailed examination of the issues raised, particularly in light of evolving social practices and the increasing number of individuals employed abroad who may wish to marry during brief visits home. However, it emphasized that granting interim relief would effectively suspend the operation of the statutory provision, which is a serious matter requiring careful consideration. The court referenced the Supreme Court's position on interim orders in cases challenging the constitutionality of legislation, underscoring the importance of not undermining statutory provisions without compelling justification.\n\nUltimately, the court declined the petitioners' request for interim relief, citing the mandatory nature of the waiting period as established by prior judgments. The case was scheduled for further proceedings in a month, with the respondents directed to file counter affidavits in the interim."}
{"ID": "id_1878", "Summary": "**Legal Summary of Writ Petition (C) No. 804 of 2020**\n\nIn this case, the Supreme Court of India addressed the constitutionality of the \"Tribunal, Appellate Tribunal and other Authorities [Qualification, Experience and Other Conditions of Service of Members] Rules, 2020\" (referred to as the \"2020 Rules\"). The Court highlighted the recurring nature of disputes regarding the appointment and functioning of various tribunals, emphasizing the importance of judicial independence and the rule of law.\n\nThe genesis of the controversy lies in the constitutional provisions enabling the establishment of administrative tribunals under Articles 323-A and 323-B of the Indian Constitution, aimed at expediting justice through specialized adjudication. The Administrative Tribunals Act, 1985, was enacted to facilitate this, but its constitutionality has been challenged multiple times, notably in the landmark case of *S.P. Sampath Kumar v. Union of India*, where the Court mandated that tribunals must function as effective substitutes for High Courts.\n\nThe 2020 Rules were framed following the Finance Act, 2017, which aimed to streamline the appointment process for tribunal members. However, the Madras Bar Association challenged these rules, arguing they violated principles of judicial independence, particularly concerning the composition of Search-cum-Selection Committees and the qualifications required for tribunal members.\n\nThe Court noted that the 2020 Rules replicated deficiencies found in the previously struck down 2017 Rules, particularly regarding the lack of judicial dominance in the selection process. The composition of the Search-cum-Selection Committees, which included government secretaries, was deemed contrary to the principles of separation of powers and judicial independence.\n\nThe Court directed the establishment of a National Tribunals Commission to oversee the appointments and functioning of tribunals, ensuring they operate independently of executive control. It mandated that the Search-cum-Selection Committees should consist of judicial members, including the Chief Justice of India or his nominee, and emphasized that the tenure of tribunal members should be a minimum of five years to enhance stability and independence.\n\nAdditionally, the Court ruled that the 2020 Rules would apply prospectively from their notification date (12.02.2020) and clarified that appointments made prior to this date would be governed by the existing parent Acts and Rules. The Court also addressed concerns regarding housing allowances for tribunal members, advocating for increased financial support to attract qualified candidates.\n\nIn conclusion, the Supreme Court reiterated the necessity for tribunals to function independently and effectively, free from executive influence, to maintain public confidence in the justice system. The Court's directives aimed to rectify the procedural shortcomings in the appointment of tribunal members and ensure adherence to constitutional principles."}

The petitioner sought a writ of declaration to declare the invalidation as illegal and requested the court to direct the respondent to evaluate her answer paper and award marks accordingly.\n\nThe petitioner, represented by Mr. G. Karthik, argued that she had successfully passed the preliminary test and participated in the main examination, where she was later called for certificate verification and an interview. Despite her expectations of scoring above the cut-off marks, she was informed that her answer paper in Part-B was invalidated due to allegedly writing irrelevant remarks, specifically the phrase \"Jai Hind, Let us live united with nature,\" at the end of her essay on the importance and conservation of natural resources. The petitioner contended that this concluding remark was relevant and appropriate to the topic.\n\nThe respondent, represented by Mr. V. Panneer Selvam, maintained that the invalidation was justified under the examination instructions, which prohibited impertinent remarks. The respondent cited specific guidelines that disqualified candidates for writing irrelevant comments or revealing their identity in answer sheets.\n\nUpon reviewing the case, the court noted that the only issue was whether the invalidation of the petitioner’s answer paper was justified. The court emphasized that the phrase \"Jai Hind\" is a common patriotic expression in India and argued that it could be seen as a natural conclusion to an essay on conservation, rather than an attempt to identify the candidate or violate examination rules. The court found that the respondent had not adequately considered the context of the entire essay and had invalidated the answer paper without proper justification.\n\nUltimately, the court ruled in favor of the petitioner, declaring the invalidation of her answer paper as illegal, unjust, and arbitrary, violating Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution of India. The court directed the respondent to validate the petitioner’s answer paper, award marks, and, if she met the requisite scores, appoint her to the relevant posts within four weeks.

(Consumer Case No. 1619 of 2018), the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission addressed a complaint filed by Aashna Roy against ITC Limited and its Chairman, alleging deficiency in service related to a hair styling incident at the ITC Maurya Hotel's salon. The complainant sought compensation for mental trauma, humiliation, and loss of career prospects after her hair was cut contrary to her explicit instructions during a visit on April 12, 2018. \n\nInitially, the Commission ruled in favor of the complainant on September 21, 2021, awarding ₹2 crores in compensation, which was subsequently challenged by the opposite party in the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court upheld the finding of deficiency in service but remanded the case back to the Commission to reassess the compensation amount, allowing the complainant to present further evidence to substantiate her claims.\n\nThe complainant detailed her experience, stating that she had requested a specific haircut but was instead given a drastically shorter style, which led to significant emotional distress and loss of modeling opportunities. Despite complaints to the salon's management, no satisfactory resolution was provided. The Commission found that the complainant had indeed been a consumer under the Consumer Protection Act, despite the opposite party's claims to the contrary.\n\nIn the subsequent proceedings, the complainant submitted additional evidence, including emails regarding job offers and modeling contracts that she claimed were lost due to the incident. However, the opposite party contended that the complainant failed to provide sufficient documentation to support her claims of loss and that the treatment she received was free of charge, thus negating any claims of negligence.\n\nAfter reviewing the evidence, the Commission determined that the complainant had sufficiently substantiated her claims for compensation but did not find merit in her request to increase the compensation amount beyond the previously awarded ₹2 crores. The Commission ordered the opposite party to pay the awarded amount along with interest at 9% per annum from the date of the original complaint until payment, emphasizing the emotional and professional impact of the incident on the complainant's life.\n\nThe Commission's final order included a directive for the release of ₹25 lakhs previously deposited with the Commission to the complainant, concluding the matter with a focus on the emotional and professional ramifications of the service deficiency experienced by the complainant."}

The petitioners argued that the cancellation was arbitrary, lacked justification, and violated principles of natural justice, as it was made without affording them an opportunity to be heard.\n\nThe Maharashtra State, represented by the Chief Secretary and the Social Justice and Special Assistance Department, defended the cancellation, asserting that the appointments were made at the pleasure of the government and were not statutory in nature. The Advocate General contended that the Commission could be disbanded at any time, and the petitioners had no legal right to their positions, as their appointments were made without a competitive selection process.\n\nThe court examined the legal framework surrounding the Commission, noting that it was established by an executive order and did not possess statutory recognition. The court concluded that the petitioners' claims regarding their tenure were unfounded, as the government had the discretion to terminate their appointments without cause. The court emphasized that changes in government policy are part of the democratic process and do not constitute arbitrary action.\n\nUltimately, the court ruled that the order cancelling the petitioners' appointments was neither illegal nor unconstitutional, affirming the government's authority to make such changes.

The petitioner requests several writs, including a writ of certiorari to annul the decision of the respondents (State and Union Territory authorities) and writs of mandamus to prevent the disclosure of names of COVID-19 positive individuals to community groups and to stop the circulation of such names in WhatsApp groups associated with resident welfare associations.\n\nThe Union of India, represented by the Solicitor General, has submitted an affidavit indicating that the guidelines issued by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare do not endorse the practice of posting such notices. The petitioner contends that the public display of a person's COVID-19 status leads to humiliation and social stigma, infringing upon their dignity and privacy, which are protected under Article 21 of the Constitution. The petitioner further argues that the practice of affixing posters is counterproductive, discouraging individuals from getting tested due to fear of public exposure.\n\nThe court, after hearing arguments from both the petitioner and the Solicitor General, notes that the guidelines from the Ministry do not support the affixing of posters outside residences of COVID-19 positive individuals. The Solicitor General confirms that no directive has been issued by the Government of India mandating such actions, and states that the practice has been retracted by some states, including Punjab and Delhi.\n\nUltimately, the court concludes that the guidelines under the Disaster Management Act, 2005 do not require the posting of such notices, and thus, no state or union territory is obligated to continue this practice. The writ petition is disposed of, affirming that the affixing of posters outside the residences of COVID-19 positive individuals is not mandated and should cease unless directed by competent authority."}

{"ID": "id_223", "Summary": "In the case of **Harish Chandra Damodar Gaikwad v. Union of India (FA-979-2009)**, the appellant, Harish Chandra Damodar Gaikwad, aged 55, residing in Ambernath, sought compensation for injuries sustained from an accidental fall while traveling on a local train on January 25, 2004. The Railway Claims Tribunal had previously rejected his claim, leading to this appeal under Section 23 of the Railway Claims Tribunal Act, 1987.\n\nThe appellant contended that he fell due to a heavy rush of passengers at Dadar Railway Station, resulting in serious injuries to his spine and pelvis, necessitating six surgeries at LTMG Hospital, Mumbai. He asserted that he was a \"bonafide passenger,\" supported by a valid season ticket and journey extension tickets. The respondents, represented by the Central Railway, countered that the injuries were due to the appellant's negligence and that he was not a \"bonafide passenger\" as defined under the relevant laws, citing a report from the Deputy Station Manager indicating that he was knocked down by a train while trespassing.\n\nThe Tribunal ruled against the appellant, stating that he was not a \"bonafide passenger\" because he failed to produce an identity card alongside his season ticket, rendering it invalid. The Tribunal also dismissed the appellant's evidence, including a police report, as insufficient.\n\nUpon appeal, the court examined the definition of \"passenger\" under Section 2(28) of the Railways Act, which requires a valid pass or ticket. The court noted that while the instructions from the Ministry of Railways mandated the production of an identity card, these were not deemed mandatory to invalidate a season ticket. The court emphasized that the appellant had a valid season ticket and journey extension tickets, and the absence of an identity card did not negate his status as a \"bonafide passenger.\"\n\nFurthermore, the court found that the evidence presented by the Deputy Station Manager was hearsay, as he did not witness the incident, and the motorman of the train was not examined. The court clarified that the concept of \"self-inflicted injuries\" requires intent, not mere negligence, and thus ruled that the appellant's injuries were sustained in an \"untoward incident\" as defined under Section 123C(2) of the Railways Act.\n\nConsequently, the court quashed the Tribunal's findings, recognizing the appellant as a \"bonafide passenger\" and directed the Railway Claims Tribunal to grant compensation in accordance with the relevant rules, ensuring that the medical evidence was verified. The court mandated that the Tribunal complete this process by July 31, 2022, and ordered the transmission of the case records to the Tribunal for further proceedings."}
{"ID": "id_226", "Summary": "The writ petitions challenge the constitutionality of the Haryana Sikh Gurdwara (Management) Act, 2014 (referred to as the 'Haryana Act'), which establishes a separate entity for managing Sikh Gurdwaras in Haryana, categorized based on their income. The Act aims to ensure that Gurdwaras, regarded as sacred by Haryana Sikhs, are managed according to their religious views, moving away from the governance under the Sikh Gurdwaras Act, 1925 (the '1925 Act').\n\nThe first petition is filed by a Haryana resident and SGPC representative, arguing that the Haryana Act violates constitutional provisions and the 1966 Act, which governs the SGPC, creating division among Sikhs. The SGPC also filed a similar petition against the Haryana Act. The Haryana government and the Haryana Sikh Gurdwara Managing Committee countered these claims, asserting the Act's validity under state legislative powers.\n\nThe Union of India contended that the Haryana Act improperly excludes the jurisdiction of the 1925 Act, which is under Parliament's exclusive legislative power as per Entry 44 of List I. The 1925 Act, enacted for better administration of Sikh Gurdwaras, has been recognized as an inter-State body corporate due to the reorganization of Punjab in 1966.\n\nThe court examined the legislative competence of the Haryana Assembly to enact the Haryana Act, considering the transitional provisions of the 1966 Act and the 1957 Act, which empower the Central Government to issue directions regarding inter-State bodies. The court noted that while the Haryana Act mirrors the 1925 Act, it infringes upon the SGPC's rights and the fundamental rights of Sikhs under Articles 25 and 26 of the Constitution.\n\nUltimately, the court found that the Haryana Act is unconstitutional as it encroaches upon the legislative domain reserved for Parliament regarding inter-State corporations. The petitions were dismissed, affirming the Haryana Act's invalidity and the SGPC's authority over Gurdwara management in Haryana. The appeal regarding the rescinded appointment of the Additional Commissioner for Gurdwara Elections was also dismissed due to lack of standing, as the term had expired."}
{"ID": "id_227", "Summary": "**Legal Summary of the Judgment on the Reappointment of Vice-Chancellor of Kannur University**\n\nThis judgment addresses the legality of the reappointment of Dr. Gopinath Ravindran as Vice-Chancellor of Kannur University, following a series of notifications and procedural actions taken by the Chancellor and the State Government. The case arose from a writ petition filed by two original petitioners, who challenged the reappointment on grounds of ineligibility due to age and procedural irregularities.\n\n**Key Facts:**\n1. Dr. Gopinath Ravindran was initially appointed as Vice-Chancellor for a four-year term starting November 24, 2017.\n2. As his term was nearing completion, a notification was issued on October 27, 2021, to form a Selection Committee for appointing a new Vice-Chancellor.\n3. A subsequent notification on November 1, 2021, invited applications for the position, stipulating that candidates must not exceed the age of sixty.\n4. On November 22, 2021, the Minister for Higher Education recommended Dr. Ravindran's reappointment, leading to the withdrawal of the earlier notifications inviting applications.\n5. The Chancellor issued a notification on November 23, 2021, reappointing Dr. Ravindran for another term.\n\n**Legal Issues:**\n1. **Reappointment Legality**: The appellants contended that reappointment was not permissible for a tenure post and that the outer age limit of sixty years applied to reappointments.\n2. **Procedural Compliance**: They argued that the reappointment process should mirror that of a fresh appointment, including the formation of a Selection Committee.\n3. **Chancellor's Authority**: Questions arose regarding whether the Chancellor had abdicated his statutory power by acting on the State Government's recommendation.\n\n**Judicial Reasoning:**\n1. **Reappointment Permissibility**: The court held that reappointment is permissible for tenure posts, emphasizing that the statute allows for such provisions to retain effective leadership.\n2. **Age Limit Application**: The court determined that the age limit under Section 10(9) of the Kannur University Act applies only at the time of initial appointment and does not restrict reappointments under Section 10(10).\n3. **Procedural Distinction**: The court concluded that the reappointment process does not require the same procedural formalities as a fresh appointment, as the statute does not mandate the formation of a Selection Committee for reappointments.\n4. **Chancellor's Discretion**: The court found that the Chancellor's decision-making process was compromised by undue influence from the State Government, which constituted an abdication of his statutory authority.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe Supreme Court allowed the appeal, quashing the notification reappointing Dr. Gopinath Ravindran as Vice-Chancellor. The court emphasized the importance of independent decision-making by the Chancellor, free from external pressures, and reaffirmed the necessity of adhering to statutory provisions in public appointments. The judgment underscores the principles of administrative law regarding the exercise of discretion and the integrity of public office appointments."}

The marriage between the petitioner and the respondent, her husband, took place on 10.03.2016, after which the petitioner faced physical and mental abuse from the respondent's family, including demands for dowry. The situation escalated when the respondent's sister-in-law assaulted the petitioner and coerced her into signing an agreement under duress. Following this, the petitioner filed an FIR against the respondent but later compromised on the assurance of no further harassment, allowing her to stay with her parents while completing her education.\n\nThe petitioner sought Rs.10,000 per month for maintenance, citing her lack of income and the respondent's employment as an assistant teacher with a monthly salary of Rs.22,000. The respondent contested the claim, admitting the marriage but denying the allegations and asserting that the petitioner voluntarily chose to live with her parents, thus absolving him of maintenance obligations.\n\nThe trial court dismissed the maintenance petition, leading to the current revision petition. The petitioner argued that the trial court erred in its findings, particularly regarding the evidence of neglect and the circumstances under which she resided with her parents. The court noted that the respondent failed to provide adequate maintenance despite the petitioner being a college student without income, and his claims of financial incapacity were unsubstantiated.\n\nThe High Court found the trial court's reasoning flawed, particularly its reliance on uncorroborated claims of the petitioner’s alleged adultery based on diary entries, which did not constitute sufficient grounds to deny maintenance. Citing precedents, the court emphasized that maintenance is a statutory right that cannot be waived or negated by agreement, and the respondent's neglect was evident.\n\nConsequently, the High Court quashed the trial court's findings and directed it to reassess the maintenance claim, ensuring a fresh judgment is issued within two months, taking into account the respondent's financial status. Both parties were ordered to appear before the trial court for further proceedings."}
{"ID": "id_237", "Summary": "In Writ Petition (Criminal) No. 68/2018, the father of a girl student pursuing an MBBS course filed a petition following her unnatural death on September 5, 2017. The petitioner lodged a First Information Report (FIR) with the local police on September 11, 2017, leading to a charge-sheet that named two individuals as accused under Sections 306 and 201 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. The investigation was subsequently transferred to the Crime Investigation Division (CBCID) of the State police, which later submitted a closure report under Section 173(8) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. \n\nOn October 30, 2018, the learned Magistrate took cognizance of the charge-sheet, and the case was committed to the Sessions Court. During the proceedings, the Additional Advocate General for Uttar Pradesh informed the court about the status of the closure report, which had not yet been adjudicated. The court noted the existence of other unnatural death cases, potentially suicides, within the same district, raising concerns about the circumstances surrounding the girl’s death.\n\nGiven the contradictory findings from the two investigative reports and the serious nature of the incidents, the court determined that a further investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) was warranted. The CBI is to be assisted by the two previous investigating agencies, and upon completion of its investigation, the CBI will submit its report to the appropriate court. Consequently, the writ petition was disposed of in these terms, along with all pending applications. The hearing took place on January 23, 2023, with representation from multiple legal counsels for both the petitioner and the respondents."}

PC). The petitioner alleged that he had fallen victim to an online loan scam, resulting in a loss of approximately Rs. 20,700. When the police showed reluctance to register the complaint, the petitioner sought the Magistrate's intervention to initiate a case.\n\nThe Magistrate, in the contested order, acknowledged the apparent commission of cognizable offences but directed the Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) of the Crime Branch, Jammu, to investigate the allegations and register a First Information Report (FIR) only if cognizable offences were confirmed. The petitioner’s counsel argued that this approach contradicted the Magistrate's initial satisfaction regarding the existence of cognizable offences.\n\nUpon reviewing the order, the court identified a contradiction: while the Magistrate recognized the likelihood of cognizable offences, the directive to the Crime Branch to determine their existence before registering an FIR was inconsistent. Consequently, the court deemed the latter part of the order legally flawed, as it improperly delegated the decision of FIR registration to the official respondents.\n\nThe court ultimately set aside the impugned order, mandating that the Incharge Cyber Cell register an FIR and ensure that the investigation is conducted by the appropriate branch handling cyber offences. The case was disposed of along with any connected applications, affirming the need for prompt action in cases of online fraud."}
{"ID": "id_239", "Summary": "In the case at hand, the appellant, a wife, filed an appeal under Section 19 of the Family Court Act, 1984, in conjunction with Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, challenging the Family Court's judgment dated December 8, 2021, which granted a divorce to the respondent, her husband, on the grounds of cruelty as per Section 13(1)(ia) of the HMA, 1955. The couple was married on March 8, 2007, and had one daughter born on November 12, 2007. \n\nThe respondent alleged that the appellant deserted their matrimonial home just four months after their marriage and subsequently filed false criminal complaints against him, including allegations of dowry demands. Despite initially filing a petition for annulment of their marriage, the appellant withdrew it in August 2009, admitting that her claims were based on misinformation. Following this, the couple cohabited until December 2, 2009, when they moved to a rented accommodation due to ongoing disputes.\n\nThe respondent claimed that the appellant attempted suicide on December 5, 2009, after which she absolved him and his family of any responsibility for her actions. Despite efforts to improve their relationship, the appellant continued to exhibit behavior that the respondent characterized as cruel, leading him to seek divorce. The appellant contested the divorce, asserting that the respondent had concealed his prior marriage and had subjected her to cruelty, including dowry demands and mental torture.\n\nThe Family Court, after reviewing the evidence, concluded that the appellant had not substantiated her claims against the respondent. It noted that her actions, including the attempt to commit suicide and subsequent allegations, constituted cruelty towards the respondent. The court emphasized that the appellant's behavior had subjected the respondent to significant mental distress, aligning with precedents set by the Supreme Court regarding mental cruelty.\n\nUltimately, the Family Court's decision to grant the divorce was upheld, with the appellate court finding no merit in the appeal. The judgment reinforced the principle that unsubstantiated allegations and the filing of false complaints can amount to mental cruelty, justifying the dissolution of marriage under the Hindu Marriage Act."}

This FIR involves a total of 52 accused, with five specifically named, and 42 individuals already arrested.\n\nThe State's preliminary submissions indicate that Taufiq, one of the accused arrested on August 9, 2023, has implicated the petitioner as an accomplice. Investigations revealed that call records and tower locations indicated communication between Taufiq and the petitioner on July 29 and 30, 2023, just prior to the incident on July 31, 2023. The petitioner was located within 1.5 kilometers of the crime scene during these dates, contradicting his claims of non-involvement. Additionally, statements from the petitioner's security officers confirmed his proximity to the incident.\n\nThe State further highlighted that the petitioner had made public statements on social media, asserting his commitment to advocate for the affected individuals. The petitioner was issued a notice on August 25, 2023, to appear for investigation on August 31, 2023, but he requested a delay due to health issues, which was not honored, leading to his nomination as an accused by the head of the Special Investigation Team (SIT) on September 4, 2023. The SIT, comprising senior police officials, is tasked with overseeing the investigation, which is reported to be progressing effectively, contributing to restored peace in the region.\n\nThe petitioner's counsel argued that the petitioner was only informed of his status as an accused during the current proceedings and sought the formation of a high-level SIT, led by officers of at least Inspector General rank, to handle the investigation of the violence that occurred on July 31, 2023. The counsel requested that the investigation details remain confidential from political authorities.\n\nThe court granted notice of motion regarding the petitioner's request for a high-level SIT and allowed the petitioner to pursue legal remedies for the protection of his liberty. The respondents, represented by Mr. Sabharwal, accepted the notice and requested an adjournment to file a response, with the case adjourned to October 19, 2023.

The respondent was the State of U.P., with representation from various legal counsels.\n\nThe court, presided over by Hon'ble Justices Siddhartha Varma and Ajit Kumar, addressed the alarming surge of COVID-19 cases that had overwhelmed medical facilities in key cities such as Prayagraj, Lucknow, Varanasi, Kanpur, and Gorakhpur. The judges noted that the existing healthcare infrastructure was inadequate, with Prayagraj's population of approximately 3 million being served by only 1,477 hospital beds, highlighting a severe shortfall in capacity.\n\nDespite the government's acknowledgment of the crisis and plans to establish temporary hospitals, the court expressed dissatisfaction with the lack of concrete action and the slow pace of response. The judges emphasized the government's responsibility to ensure public health and criticized the prioritization of elections over health safety, noting that social distancing measures were not being enforced during the electoral process.\n\nThe court highlighted the dire consequences of the pandemic, including the risk of widespread infection and the potential collapse of the healthcare system if urgent measures were not implemented. It pointed out that the current strategies, such as night curfews, were insufficient and merely symbolic.\n\nIn response to the escalating situation, the court issued a series of directives aimed at curbing the spread of COVID-19. These included the closure of all non-essential establishments, restrictions on public gatherings, and the suspension of religious activities until April 26, 2021. The court mandated that only essential services remain operational and called for robust implementation of vaccination programs.\n\nFurthermore, the court urged the government to consider a complete lockdown for at least two weeks to effectively break the transmission chain of the virus and provide relief to healthcare workers. The matter was scheduled for further review on April 26, 2021, emphasizing the judiciary's commitment to safeguarding public health in the face of governmental shortcomings."}

Saraf addressed a writ petition concerning an acid attack on two siblings, a 17-year-old girl (petitioner no. 1) and her 14-year-old brother (petitioner no. 2). The petition primarily sought compensation for the female victim, as the brother had already received ₹4,50,000 under existing rules. The petitioners argued that, in accordance with the Supreme Court's judgments and the NALSA’s Compensation Scheme for Women Victims/Survivors of Sexual Assault/other Crimes, 2018, a minimum compensation of ₹8,00,000 should be awarded, with an additional 50% due to the victim's minor status.\n\nThe Court referenced several Supreme Court rulings, notably Laxmi vs. Union of India, which highlighted the inadequacy of compensation across different states and mandated a minimum of ₹3,00,000 for acid attack victims. The Court also discussed the severe physical, social, and psychological ramifications of acid attacks, emphasizing that monetary compensation alone cannot address the lifelong challenges faced by victims, including social stigma and the need for ongoing medical care.\n\nIn light of these considerations, the Court determined that the compensation for the main victim, Chanchal, should be enhanced to ₹10,00,000, reflecting the severity of her injuries and the extensive treatment already incurred by her family. Additionally, the Court ordered that the sister, Sonam, should receive ₹5,00,000, with the total compensation to be disbursed within specified timeframes.\n\nThe judgment underscored the State's obligation to adhere to the Supreme Court's directives and the necessity for the West Bengal government to align its compensation scheme with NALSA’s guidelines. The Court directed the State to amend its compensation framework within eight weeks to ensure compliance with the Supreme Court's standards.\n\nJustice Saraf concluded by lamenting the current state of governance in West Bengal, urging the government to reclaim its historical commitment to women's rights and welfare, thus reinforcing the need for timely and adequate compensation for victims of heinous crimes. The writ petition was disposed of with these directives, and the Registrar General was instructed to ensure prompt communication of the order to relevant authorities."}

The appellant received a ten-year rigorous imprisonment sentence for the rape charge and three years for the other charges, with all sentences running concurrently.\n\nThe prosecution's case centers on Deepika Jagushte (PW-7) and her husband Shailesh Jagushte (PW-8), who, after being childless for two years, sought the appellant's assistance, believing he could help them conceive. They visited the appellant regularly, where he provided them with vibhuti (holy ash) and conducted rituals. In May 2015, the appellant suggested a 'Reiki procedure' that involved the couple having sexual relations in his presence, which they did multiple times under the appellant's direction.\n\nOn July 24, 2016, during a visit to their home, the appellant allegedly instructed Shailesh to leave the room, claiming he needed to perform a procedure on Deepika. Once alone, the appellant is accused of sexually assaulting her. Following the incident, a complaint was filed, leading to an investigation and the eventual charges against the appellant.\n\nDuring the trial, the prosecution presented ten witnesses, while the appellant maintained his innocence, claiming false implication. The Sessions Judge found the evidence of PW-7 and PW-8 credible and consistent, despite the defense's arguments regarding the improbability of the events and the delay in reporting the incident.\n\nThe appellant's counsel argued that the couple's education and the presence of other devotees made the allegations implausible, and questioned the timing of the complaint. However, the court noted that the victims' faith in the appellant played a significant role in their actions and decisions.\n\nThe court upheld the conviction, affirming that the appellant's actions fell within the definition of rape as per Section 375 of the IPC. However, it modified the sentence for the rape charge from ten years to seven years, as the incident occurred before the amendment that set a minimum sentence of ten years.\n\nIn conclusion, the appeal was partly allowed, modifying the sentence for the rape charge while confirming the convictions under Sections 354 of IPC and 3(2) of the Black Magic Act. The appellant is to serve seven years of rigorous imprisonment for the rape charge, alongside fines and concurrent sentences for the other offenses."}
{"ID": "id_304", "Summary": "On November 20, 2023, a writ petition was filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India by Prasanta Karmakar, an Arjuna Awardee and medalist swimmer, challenging the three-year suspension imposed by the Paralympic Committee of India (PCI) on February 7, 2018. The suspension, effective from January 20, 2018, barred him from participating in any sports events organized by PCI and recommended disciplinary action from his employer, the Haryana Sports Department.\n\nThe case arose from events during the XVI National Para Swimming Championship held in Jaipur from March 31 to April 3, 2017, where Karmakar, serving as a coach, allegedly directed an associate to film female swimmers. This action drew objections from parents, leading to complaints against him. Despite being warned, Karmakar continued filming, resulting in police intervention and his agreement to delete the footage. Following this, he reportedly threatened PCI officials and made derogatory statements in media interviews.\n\nIn response to the complaints, PCI issued a Show-Cause Notice on August 16, 2017, to which Karmakar denied the allegations and requested supporting documents. A personal hearing was conducted on January 20, 2018, after which the Disciplinary Committee decided on the suspension.\n\nKarmakar's petition sought to quash the suspension, allow his participation in swimming activities, and claim damages for what he described as arbitrary and illegal debarment, violating his fundamental rights under Article 19(1)(g). He argued that the suspension was disproportionate and that filming swimmers was not prohibited by PCI's rules.\n\nConversely, PCI's counsel cited Bye-law Clause 19.1.6, which prohibits misbehavior by athletes, asserting that Karmakar's actions warranted the suspension. They contended that he was given ample opportunity to defend himself and that the Disciplinary Committee's decision was justified based on the severity of the complaints against him.\n\nThe court, upon reviewing the case, noted that Karmakar had completed his suspension period by the time of the hearing but chose to examine the merits of the case. It referenced the relevant Bye-laws, affirming that the rules apply equally to coaches and athletes, and concluded that Karmakar's behavior constituted misconduct. The court emphasized that it would not interfere with the Disciplinary Committee's decision unless it was found to be unreasonable or unfair, which it was not in this instance.\n\nUltimately, the court dismissed Karmakar's writ petition, upholding the suspension and rejecting his claims for reinstatement and damages."}

This FIR was registered following the murder of Raghvendra, leading to charges under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the M.P. Dakaiti Aur Vyapharan Prabhavit Kshetra Adhiniyam, 1981 (MPDVPK Act).\n\nThe investigation resulted in the arrest of the accused, with charges framed against them, including serious offenses such as murder and robbery. Notably, three of the five accused were juveniles, with one being tried as an adult. Despite the trial commencing over four years ago, the proceedings have been delayed primarily due to the non-appearance of formal witnesses, including police officers, necessitating the issuance of bailable and arrest warrants.\n\nThe petitioner’s counsel emphasized the fundamental right to a speedy trial under Article 21 of the Constitution, arguing that the delay, which is not attributable to the complainant, undermines justice. The counsel cited several Supreme Court judgments that reinforce the right to a timely trial and highlighted the systemic issues causing delays, including ineffective service of summons to witnesses.\n\nThe State's counsel acknowledged the delays but pointed out the challenges in securing witness attendance, particularly due to transfers and relocations. Both parties expressed concern over the prolonged trial, which has caused significant distress to the petitioner, who has already suffered the loss of his son.\n\nThe Court recognized the importance of timely justice and the adverse effects of delays on the prosecution's case, particularly in serious offenses like murder. It reiterated the necessity for a structured approach to ensure witness attendance, suggesting the creation of WhatsApp groups for efficient communication regarding summons and witness protection. This innovative approach aims to facilitate timely notifications and safeguard witnesses from intimidation.\n\nThe Court directed the police and prosecution to take proactive measures to ensure the presence of witnesses and to expedite the trial process. It mandated that the trial court schedule hearings on a weekly basis and address any attempts by the defense to delay proceedings. The order concluded with directives to relevant authorities to implement these measures promptly, emphasizing the collective responsibility of all stakeholders in the justice system to uphold the right to a speedy trial.\n\nBoth petitions were allowed and disposed of with the aforementioned directions, and compliance was to be reported in a subsequent hearing scheduled for November 20, 2023."}

The applications were considered together due to the identical pleas of the co-accused.\n\nThe prosecution's case alleges that on 02.12.2020, police apprehended the accused while they were carrying bags containing a total of 12 kg of Ganja each. The bags were searched, and the narcotic substance was recovered, leading to their formal arrest on 03.12.2020. The prosecution claims that the accused were involved in a conspiracy to sell illegal cannabis, supported by call detail records (CDR) indicating frequent communication between them and another individual, Manish, who allegedly facilitated the drug transaction.\n\nThe defense argued that the quantity of Ganja recovered was intermediate, thus not invoking the stringent provisions of Section 37 of the NDPS Act, which applies to commercial quantities. They contended that the CDR evidence was inadmissible and raised concerns about the legality of the search and seizure, claiming procedural violations under the NDPS Act, including the lack of proper authorization for the search and the improper handling of the seized samples.\n\nThe court noted that the prosecution's reliance on CDR details to establish conspiracy was insufficient without additional corroborative evidence. It emphasized that the invocation of Section 29 of the NDPS Act, which pertains to conspiracy, requires clear evidence of abetment or conspiracy, which was not adequately demonstrated in this case.\n\nThe court also highlighted the prolonged detention of the accused, who had been in custody for over three years, and noted the delays in the trial process. Citing precedents, the court acknowledged that undue delay in trial could infringe upon the right to a speedy trial under Article 21 of the Constitution of India, thus warranting consideration for bail.\n\nUltimately, the court granted bail to both applicants, stipulating conditions including the requirement to inform the court of any change in address, regular reporting to the investigating officer, and restrictions on leaving the country. The judgment emphasized that the observations made were solely for the purpose of the bail decision and should not be construed as a reflection on the merits of the case. The bail applications were disposed of accordingly."}
{"ID": "id_333", "Summary": "In the case at hand, the petitioner sought the quashing of FIR No. 162/2021, registered at Police Station Daryaganj, Delhi, under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO). The FIR was filed on the basis of a statement from the victim, a 17-year-old girl, who alleged that the accused, Mohd. Amaan Malik, had engaged in sexual relations with her without consent, following a pattern of blackmail and coercion.\n\nThe victim recounted that she had developed a friendship with the accused while attending tuition classes and was subsequently lured to a guest house where she was given alcohol and assaulted. After discovering her pregnancy, the victim's mother confronted the accused, leading to a coerced marriage. The victim claimed that the accused continued to threaten and abuse her, demanding an abortion and physically assaulting her.\n\nDuring the investigation, medical examinations confirmed the victim's pregnancy, and DNA tests established the accused as the biological father. The victim's age was corroborated by school records, confirming she was a minor at the time of the alleged offences. The petitioner argued that the relationship was consensual and that the marriage was valid under Muslim personal law, asserting that the victim's family had consented to the marriage.\n\nThe State's counsel contended that the victim's consent was irrelevant due to her age, emphasizing that the allegations of sexual assault were supported by her statements and medical evidence. The court referenced established legal principles regarding the quashing of FIRs, noting that such actions should be taken sparingly and only in cases where no cognizable offence is disclosed.\n\nUltimately, the court found that the allegations in the FIR and the victim's statements indicated a prima facie case of sexual assault, and the consent of a minor is not legally recognized. The court dismissed the petition, allowing the case to proceed in the trial court, while clarifying that its observations would not affect the trial's merits. The judgment was ordered to be uploaded on the court's website."}
{"ID": "id_355", "Summary": "In the case of Anil Vishnu Anturkar v. Chandrakumar Popatlal Baldota & Ors., the petitioner, a Senior Advocate, challenged a witness summons issued on March 23, 2015, requiring him to appear before the Civil Judge, Senior Division, Pune, to provide evidence in Special Civil Suit No. 1209 of 2004. The summons was set for March 27, 2015, while the petition was filed with a hearing date of April 4, 2015. The petitioner sought to quash the summons, which was stayed by an interim order on March 31, 2015.\n\nThe petitioner contended that the summons demanded the production of a letter dated January 11, 2004, addressed to his deceased client, Shri Dara Bharucha, which was claimed to be a privileged communication under Section 126 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. The petitioner argued that he had not received a copy of the plaint in the civil suit, thus lacking clarity on the suit's purpose and the other defendants involved. He emphasized that the communication was a professional opinion and, as such, protected from disclosure without the client’s express consent, which he did not possess, especially since the client was deceased.\n\nIn contrast, the respondent's counsel argued that the petitioner was merely required to confirm his signature on the already disclosed communication, asserting that it was no longer privileged since it had been made public.\n\nThe court examined the provisions of Section 126 of the Evidence Act, which prohibits a barrister from disclosing any communication made during the course of their professional engagement without the client’s consent. The court noted that this obligation persists even after the professional relationship has ended. It also referenced Section 129, which protects confidential communications between a client and their legal adviser, but clarified that the case at hand primarily concerned professional communications under Section 126.\n\nUltimately, the court concluded that the communication dated January 11, 2004, constituted a privileged communication, and the petitioner could not be compelled to produce it or confirm his signature. The witness summons was deemed invalid and was quashed, allowing the petition in favor of the petitioner without costs."}
{"ID": "id_357", "Summary": "In the case presented before the court, the petitioner, represented by Mr. Devadatt Kamat and a team of advocates, challenges the orders dated November 3, 2023, and February 20, 2023, issued by the respondents, which dismissed the petitioner's application for a stay of demand during the pendency of an appeal before the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) concerning an assessment order dated December 30, 2022. The petitioner seeks a stay of demand while the appeal is ongoing.\n\nThe senior counsel for the petitioner argues that the discretion to grant a stay should be exercised judiciously, based on relevant grounds, and not arbitrarily. He contends that the impugned orders lack proper consideration and reflect a mechanical approach, demonstrating a complete non-application of mind. The petitioner asserts a strong prima facie case, citing a Service Agreement with Justice and Education Fund Inc. (JEF), which outlines the legitimacy of the business activities and the proper disclosure of receipts in the Income Tax Return (ITR). The agreement specifies unit prices for deliverables, including articles, videos, and short scripts, and asserts that all intellectual property rights associated with the work produced belong exclusively to JEF.\n\nThe petitioner further argues that the rejection of the stay application based on financial stringency is untenable, as the financial statements provided demonstrate the company's viability. The counsel emphasizes that under Section 220(6) of the Income Tax Act, 1961, there is no requirement for a pre-deposit to obtain a stay, and the Supreme Court's ruling in CIT v. LG Electronics India (P) Ltd. supports this position.\n\nThe respondents, however, contend that the petitioner has not established a prima facie case, citing findings from the assessment order that question the genuineness of the transactions between the petitioner and JEF. The Assessing Officer noted that the agreement appeared to lack commercial substance, with predetermined payments and insufficient evidence linking receipts to actual services rendered. The officer highlighted discrepancies in the timing of content uploads and the absence of binding directions from JEF, suggesting that the arrangement was merely a façade to justify the remittance of funds.\n\nThe court, upon reviewing the arguments and evidence, concluded that the petitioner has not demonstrated a prima facie case in its favor, stating that the financial claims lack credibility given the Assessing Officer's findings. The court dismissed the writ petition but clarified that its findings are limited to the current proceedings and will not affect the appellate process.\n\nIn summary, the court found that the petitioner failed to establish a strong case for a stay of demand, leading to the dismissal of the petition while preserving the rights of both parties in the appellate context."}

State of Maharashtra**\n\n**Parties Involved:**\n- **Appellant:** Abdul Rauf Dawood Merchant, aged 31, currently imprisoned at Pune Central Prison.\n- **Respondents:** State of Maharashtra, represented by D.N. Nagar Police Station (C.R. No. 572/1998).\n\n**Background:**\nThis appeal challenges the judgment and order dated April 29, 2002, by the Additional Sessions Judge, Greater Mumbai, convicting the appellant for multiple serious offenses, including murder, attempted murder, robbery, and violations of the Arms Act, in connection with the assassination of Gulshan Kumar Dua, the Managing Director of Super Cassette Industries, on August 12, 1997.\n\n**Key Facts:**\n- Gulshan Kumar was shot dead in broad daylight outside Shiv Mandir, Andheri, while returning to his car after offering prayers.

The petitioners were represented by a team of senior advocates led by Dr. Abhishek Manu Singhvi. The crux of the petition revolves around the quashing of FIR No. 37/2015, which the petitioners argue is based on allegations similar to those in FIR No. 605/2017, previously quashed by the Hon’ble Supreme Court on 23.10.2017. \n\nThe petitioners contended that the police investigation into FIR No. 37/2015 resulted in a negative final report, indicating that the matter is of a civil nature, specifically concerning a loan of Rs. 25 Crores. They emphasized that the allegations had already been adjudicated in their favor by the Supreme Court, which noted that the criminal proceedings were initiated to obstruct ongoing insolvency proceedings under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code. \n\nDuring the hearing, the court acknowledged the petitioners' willingness to appear before the trial court but expressed concern over the issuance of arrest warrants without prior summons. The court issued notices to the respondents and allowed time for the respondents to file a reply.

State of U.P. and Others, the petitioners, represented by counsel Sudhir Mehrotra, seek to quash an FIR dated March 24, 2022, registered as Case Crime No. 108/2022 under Sections 363 and 366 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) at Police Station Rasoolpur, District Firozabad. They also request protection from arrest and a transfer of the investigation to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). The petitioners allege that the FIR was filed as part of a pattern of harassment by police officials in District Mathura, who have previously lodged numerous false cases against them and their family members to coerce them into compromising earlier disputes.\n\nThe background of the case reveals a series of incidents beginning with an attempted murder of the petitioners' brother, Puneet Kumar, in 2013, which led to the filing of various FIRs against the petitioners and their family. The petitioners' mother, Maya Devi, sought intervention from the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) due to the police's alleged misconduct, resulting in further investigations that implicated several police personnel in the wrongful detention and framing of the petitioners.\n\nThe petitioners assert that the recent FIR was filed in retaliation for their complaints against the police, particularly after a report by the Special Enquiry Cell found prima facie evidence of police misconduct. They contend that the complainant, Rekha Devi, was manipulated by police officer Harvendra Mishra to lodge the FIR against them. The petitioners also highlight discrepancies in the evidence, such as the victim's illiteracy and the language of the alleged communications.\n\nIn a companion writ petition, the complainant seeks a fair investigation into the same FIR, indicating a shared concern for the integrity of the investigative process. The Senior Superintendent of Police, Agra, has acknowledged the transfer of the investigation to Agra, but the petitioners argue that this does not ensure impartiality given the involvement of local police.\n\nThe court, upon reviewing the allegations and the findings of the Special Enquiry report, recognizes the need for a fair investigation, citing precedents that allow for the transfer of cases to ensure justice. The State Counsel expressed no objection to transferring the investigation to the CBI, which the court subsequently ordered. The court directed the Principal Secretary of Home, U.P. Government, to facilitate the transfer of Case Crime No. 108/2022 to the CBI, restraining local police from further proceedings in the matter.\n\nThe court scheduled a follow-up hearing for November 9, 2022, during which the CBI is expected to report on the progress of the investigation. This decision underscores the court's commitment to ensuring a fair trial and investigation, particularly in light of the serious allegations against law enforcement officials."}

The court noted that the petitioner had complied with the previous order dated November 1, 2022, regarding the deposit of maintenance arrears, a fact not disputed by the respondent's counsel. However, the respondent's counsel indicated that the release of the deposited amount was contested by the petitioner.\n\nAdditionally, it was brought to the court's attention that the respondent had filed RP(FC) No. 316 of 2022 to seek an enhancement of maintenance, prompting the court to direct that both petitions be heard together on January 5, 2023. The interim order was extended until that date, and the court called for the lower court records.\n\nThe court expressed concern over a recurring issue where Family Courts delay the release of maintenance arrears to claimants, often requiring further orders from the higher court. This practice was deemed detrimental to the claimants' interests, as timely access to funds is crucial for their survival. Consequently, the court ordered the Family Court to release the deposited amount within three days of receiving the order, emphasizing the need for prompt compliance.\n\nFurthermore, the court mandated that all Family Court judges ensure the immediate release of maintenance arrears to claimants, advising that the courts should contact claimants directly to facilitate this process. If direct payment was not feasible, the amounts could be deposited according to legal procedures.

The petitions challenge the ADI's decisions communicated via memos dated July 3, 2020, and October 14, 2020, which dissolved the panels for the appointment of a clerk and laboratory attendants, respectively.\n\n**Key Facts:**\n1. **WPA 7283 of 2020:** The petitioner contested the ADI's memo dated July 3, 2020, which rejected the panel for the clerk position on grounds of procedural violations, including failure to requisition candidates from the employment exchange within 45 days and postponing the interview without approval.\n2. **WPA 507 of 2021:** The petitioner challenged the ADI's memo dated October 14, 2020, which similarly rejected the panel for laboratory attendants, citing procedural lapses including lack of preliminary screening and failure to obtain necessary approvals.\n\n**Legal Issues:**\n1. **Nature of the 45-Day Requirement:** The court examined whether the 45-day requisition rule was mandatory or directory. It concluded that noncompliance with this timeline does not invalidate the entire selection process, as it serves the purpose of facilitating timely appointments.\n2. **Postponement of Interviews:** The court found that the school authorities had informed the DI of the postponement due to unforeseen circumstances, and the DI's silence on the matter precluded penalizing the school for this action.\n3. **Candidate Age Eligibility:** The court ruled that the age of candidates should be assessed based on the date of advertisement rather than the date of requisition, affirming that the petitioner was eligible as he was of age at the time of advertisement.\n4. **Applicability of Recruitment Rules:** The court determined that the 2009 Rules, which superseded the 2005 Rules, apply to the selection process since the advertisement was published after the enactment of the new rules.\n\n**Decision:**\nThe court set aside the impugned memos from the ADI, acknowledging that the grounds for rejection were not tenable in law. However, it clarified that the selection process must adhere to the 2009 Rules, which require that appointments be made through the West Bengal School Service Commission, not the managing committee of the school. Consequently, both writ petitions were dismissed, and no relief was granted to the petitioners.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe judgment emphasizes the importance of procedural compliance in recruitment processes while also recognizing the need for flexibility in applying rules to avoid unjust outcomes. The court's decision reflects a balance between upholding procedural integrity and ensuring that candidates are not unfairly disadvantaged by technicalities."}

It highlighted the necessity for clear orders or guidelines regarding the installation of such surveillance equipment. Consequently, the State Police Chief was added as the fifth respondent to facilitate the development of appropriate guidelines in consultation with the State Government. The Government Pleader was tasked with ensuring that the State Police Chief received a copy of the court's order and was informed of the court's concerns regarding privacy implications."}

The appeals were filed by Mr. Aroon Purie, Mr. Parampreet Singh Randhawa, and Mr. Saurabh Shukla, against the summoning order issued in connection with a complaint alleging defamation due to an article published in *India Today* titled \"Mission Misconduct.\"\n\nThe article, published between April 23 and April 30, 2007, reported serious allegations against Indian officials in the UK, including sexual misconduct and corruption. It specifically mentioned an officer of the Indian Foreign Service accused of soliciting sexual favors, which led to disciplinary actions against him. The complainant, an unnamed officer, alleged that the article was defamatory and based on unverified information, causing significant harm to his reputation.\n\nThe original complaint was filed by the officer in question, who claimed that the article was published maliciously and without substantiation, implicating several individuals, including the editor and correspondent of *India Today*. The complaint sought legal action against the accused under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) for defamation.\n\nThe Metropolitan Magistrate found sufficient grounds to proceed against the accused, leading to the appeals being filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, seeking to quash the summoning order. The High Court dismissed these petitions, asserting that the allegations raised disputed questions of fact that could not be resolved at that stage.\n\nDuring the Supreme Court proceedings, the counsel for the appellants argued that the Editor-in-Chief, Mr. Aroon Purie, could not be held liable under Section 7 of the Press and Registration of Books Act, 1867, as there was no clear evidence of his involvement in the publication of the article. The public servants involved contended that their actions were merely administrative and did not constitute defamation.\n\nThe Supreme Court, referencing previous judgments, concluded that while the Editor-in-Chief could be presumed responsible for the publication, the allegations against him were insufficient to establish liability. The Court emphasized that the public servants acted within their official capacity and were protected from prosecution under the IPC.\n\nUltimately, the Supreme Court accepted the appeals concerning Mr. Aroon Purie and the public servants, quashing the summoning order and the complaint against them, while rejecting the appeal of Mr. Saurabh Shukla, the article's author, indicating that his case would be subject to trial. This decision underscores the complexities of defamation law, particularly in the context of media publications and the responsibilities of editors and journalists."}
{"ID": "id_470", "Summary": "**Legal Summary of the Judgment on Bail Application of Manish Sisodia**\n\nThe judgment addresses the bail application of Manish Sisodia, the former Deputy Chief Minister of Delhi, which was previously dismissed by a Special Judge on April 28, 2023. The Enforcement Directorate (ED) initiated an investigation under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) concerning alleged irregularities in the formulation and implementation of the Delhi Excise Policy for 2021-22, implicating Sisodia and others in a conspiracy to facilitate kickbacks and illegal financial gains.\n\n**Factual Background:**\nThe case stems from an FIR registered by the CBI against Sisodia and others, alleging conspiracy under Section 120B of the Indian Penal Code and violations of the Prevention of Corruption Act. The ED's investigation revealed that the excise policy was allegedly designed to benefit certain private entities, including Indo Spirits, which was purportedly established as a vehicle for recouping kickbacks. The policy reportedly allowed for exorbitant profit margins and facilitated cartelization, leading to significant financial losses for the government.\n\n**Arguments Presented:**\n1. **Defense Arguments:** Sisodia's counsel argued that there was insufficient evidence to establish his involvement in any wrongdoing. They contended that the allegations were based on hearsay and lacked corroborative evidence. The defense emphasized discrepancies in witness statements and asserted that the ED's reliance on statements recorded under Section 50 of the PMLA was misplaced, as these lacked independent verification.\n\n2. **Prosecution Arguments:** The ED contended that Sisodia played a pivotal role in the conspiracy, manipulating the excise policy to benefit private players in exchange for kickbacks. They highlighted the systematic nature of the alleged conspiracy, including the involvement of various stakeholders and the use of proceeds from crime to fund political activities, including election campaigns.\n\n**Court's Findings:**\nThe court noted that the allegations against Sisodia were serious, involving a deep-rooted conspiracy with significant implications for public funds. It acknowledged the complexity of proving such conspiracies, which often occur behind closed doors, and stated that direct evidence is rarely available. The court emphasized that the statements made under Section 50 of the PMLA, while not conclusive, could indicate a pattern of involvement in illicit activities.\n\nThe court also considered the potential for witness tampering, given Sisodia's political stature and the nature of the allegations. It concluded that the evidence presented by the ED, including witness statements and the overall context of the case, suggested a strong likelihood of Sisodia's involvement in the alleged money laundering activities.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nUltimately, the court upheld the dismissal of Sisodia's bail application, finding that he did not meet the criteria for bail under Section 45 of the PMLA, which requires a showing of reasonable grounds for believing the accused is not guilty. The court reiterated the need for a cautious approach in economic offenses, given their potential to undermine public trust and financial integrity.\n\nThe petition for bail was dismissed, and the court underscored the gravity of the charges and the necessity of maintaining the integrity of the ongoing investigation."}

The petitioner contends that according to the precedent set in Parshuram Vs. State of U.P. (Matter Under Article 227 No. 31424 of 2021), once an election petition is resolved, the prescribed authority becomes functus officio, thus lacking the jurisdiction to issue further orders, including the recount directive.\n\nConversely, the respondents, represented by learned counsel Mukesh Mohan Sharma and Arvind Kumar Shukla, argue that the petitioner has a statutory remedy available through a revision under Section 12-C (6) of the Act, rendering the writ petition non-maintainable. However, the court, upon reviewing the arguments and the record, finds that the order impugned appears to exceed the authority granted to the prescribed authority under the Act, as it contravenes the established legal principle that prohibits further orders post-decision of an election petition.\n\nConsequently, the court determines that a prima facie case for intervention exists and stays the operation of the January 2 order pending further proceedings. The court issues notices to additional respondents and sets timelines for the filing of counter-affidavits and rejoinders. Furthermore, the court expresses dissatisfaction with the lack of legal assistance provided by the learned Standing counsel, emphasizing the need for improved representation in future hearings.

The complaint alleged offenses including rioting, theft, and defilement of a place of worship, stemming from a long-standing family dispute over property inherited from their late father, Munish Ram.\n\nThe facts reveal that Krishna Devi, the petitioner No. 1, was granted ownership of 40 kanals and 8 marlas of land through a transfer deed dated May 23, 2005. Respondent No. 2, who is her brother, contested this transfer in Civil Suit No. 57 of 2006, claiming the property was ancestral and that he was in possession. This suit was dismissed on September 17, 2013, affirming the validity of the transfer deed and the subsequent mutation in favor of Krishna Devi. Despite this, Respondent No. 2 filed another suit in 2014, which led to a status quo order regarding the land.\n\nThe criminal complaint filed by Respondent No. 1 in 2015 mirrored the allegations from the civil suits, leading to the petitioners being summoned under IPC Sections 148, 295, and 149. The petitioners contended that the complaint was an abuse of legal process, as it concealed the outcomes of the civil suits that established their rightful possession of the land. They argued that the allegations lacked merit, particularly regarding the offense under Section 295 IPC, which pertains to the desecration of places of worship, asserting that a family samadh does not constitute a place of worship under the law.\n\nThe court, upon reviewing the evidence and legal arguments, found that the civil proceedings had conclusively established the petitioners' possession of the disputed land, which was not disclosed in the complaint. The court ruled that the continuance of the criminal proceedings was an abuse of process, as no offenses under the cited IPC sections were substantiated. Consequently, the court quashed the complaint and the summoning order, thereby dismissing all subsequent proceedings arising from it.\n\nIn conclusion, the court emphasized that the allegations made by Respondent No. 1 were unfounded and that the legal rights established in the civil suits should have precluded the initiation of the criminal complaint. The decision underscores the importance of judicial integrity and the need to prevent misuse of legal processes in ongoing disputes."}
{"ID": "id_524", "Summary": "In the case of **Vinod Shivkumar Vs. State of Maharashtra**, the court addressed a bail application concerning the applicant, Vinod Shivkumar, who was arrested following the suicide of Mrs. ‘D’, a Range Forest Officer. The prosecution alleged that Mrs. ‘D’ had left three suicide notes, one addressed to her superior, Mr. Reddy, and the others to her mother and husband, implicating Shivkumar in her distress. The notes described a pattern of harassment, humiliation, and threats that Mrs. ‘D’ allegedly faced from Shivkumar, suggesting that such treatment led her to contemplate suicide.\n\nThe applicant's counsel, Mr. Firdos Mirza, contended that the letters, even if taken at face value, did not establish a prima facie case of abetment to suicide as defined under Section 306 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). He referenced the Supreme Court's ruling in **Amalendu Pal alias Jhantu v. State of West Bengal** to support his argument. Furthermore, he argued that the allegations in the letters were contradicted by other evidence collected during the investigation, which he claimed undermined the prosecution's case.\n\nThe court acknowledged the emotional weight of the letters but noted that the determination of whether the applicant's conduct constituted abetment would ultimately be for the trial court to decide. It recognized that while there appeared to be a prima facie case for abetment, the charges under Section 312, concerning miscarriage, lacked sufficient evidence of intent.\n\nIn considering the bail application, the court emphasized that the existence of a prima facie case is not the sole factor in deciding bail. Other considerations include the gravity of the offense, the applicant's status, and the risk of flight or influencing witnesses. The prosecution argued against bail, citing the applicant's alleged attempt to flee after the incident; however, the court found no compelling evidence to suggest that the applicant posed a flight risk or would interfere with the trial.\n\nUltimately, the court granted bail to Shivkumar, stipulating that he must furnish a personal bond of Rs. 1,00,000 with two solvent sureties, report to the police bi-monthly, and refrain from contacting witnesses. The court also mandated that he provide his current address and contact information to the Investigating Officer and deposit his passport, ensuring he would not leave the country without court permission. The decision reflects a careful balancing of the prosecution's claims and the applicant's rights, emphasizing that pre-trial detention should not serve as punishment."}
{"ID": "id_541", "Summary": "**Legal Summary of Judgment Delivered on 15.09.2023**\n\n**Parties Involved:**\n- **Applicant:** Jiyaullah\n- **Opposite Party:** State of U.P. and Another\n- **Counsel for Applicant:** Mirza Ali Zulfaqar\n- **Counsel for Opposite Party:** G.A.\n- **Judge:** Hon'ble Anish Kumar Gupta, J.\n\n**Case Background:**\nThe applicant, Jiyaullah, filed an application under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) seeking to quash the charge sheet dated 16.03.2020 and the cognizance/summoning order dated 10.12.2020, along with the entire proceedings of Case No. 21205 of 2020 (State vs. Ziya Ullah). The case involved allegations under Sections 419, 420, 376, 504, and 506 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), stemming from Case Crime No. 20/2019 at P.S. Mahila Thana, District Sant Kabir Nagar.\n\n**Factual Summary:**\nThe victim, born on 01.06.1994, alleged that she and the applicant developed a romantic relationship during meetings at her sister's marriage in Gorakhpur, which continued for approximately eight years. The victim's family reportedly facilitated the applicant's trip to Saudi Arabia, expecting marriage upon his return. However, after repeated pressures for marriage, the applicant denied the proposal, leading to the victim's complaint in 2019. The victim claimed that their physical relationship began when she was 17, and continued under the promise of marriage until the applicant's refusal in 2018.\n\n**Legal Arguments:**\nThe applicant's counsel argued that the prosecution was a misuse of legal process, emphasizing the consensual nature of the relationship and the absence of any offense as per the allegations. Citing precedents from the Supreme Court, the counsel contended that prolonged consensual relationships cannot be classified as rape, particularly when the promise of marriage was not false at inception.\n\nThe State's counsel maintained that the victim was a minor during the initial stages of the relationship, thus negating the possibility of consent under Section 375 IPC.\n\n**Judicial Reasoning:**\nThe court examined the nature of consent in the context of the relationship, referencing several Supreme Court judgments that clarify the legal standards for consent and the implications of a promise to marry. The court noted that the relationship was consensual, supported by the victim's family, and that the applicant's subsequent refusal to marry did not retroactively invalidate the consent given during the relationship.\n\nThe court concluded that the allegations did not establish an offense under Section 376 IPC, as the relationship was consensual and the promise of marriage was not false at its inception. Consequently, the application under Section 482 Cr.P.C. was allowed, quashing the charge sheet, cognizance order, and all proceedings related to the case.\n\n**Final Ruling:**\nThe court quashed the charge sheet dated 16.03.2020, the cognizance/summoning order dated 10.12.2020, and the entire proceedings of Case No. 21205 of 2020, affirming that no offense was established against the applicant."}
{"ID": "id_560", "Summary": "In the case identified by Neutral Citation Number 2023/DHC/001854, the appellant's appeal challenges the order dated January 29, 2021, which rejected Application No. 6570/DEL NP/2009 by the Assistant Controller of Patents. The court expressed significant dissatisfaction with the impugned order, describing it as poorly drafted and lacking clarity, making it difficult to discern the reasoning behind the Assistant Controller's conclusions. \n\nThe court noted that the order failed to clearly delineate the claims, the First Examination Report (FER), and the reasoning of the Assistant Controller. It highlighted that the order included irrelevant cut-and-paste elements, such as a partial diagram, which contributed to its incomprehensibility. The only semblance of reasoning found in the order was a vague assertion regarding the nature of the apparatus, which lacked any substantive explanation.\n\nThe court criticized the Assistant Controller for demonstrating confusion regarding the claims and objections raised in the FER and the notice of hearing. It pointed out that the order incorrectly referenced Section 2(1)(j) instead of Section 2(1)(ja) and based the rejection on Section 3(k), which was not mentioned in the notice of hearing. The court emphasized that the order reflected a haphazard assembly of various documents without coherent reasoning, leaving the appellant unable to understand the basis for the rejection.\n\nThe court expressed its astonishment at the arbitrary nature of the order, underscoring the importance of a well-reasoned decision in patent matters, which have significant implications for innovation and public interest. It stressed that patent decisions must be made with careful consideration and should not be mechanically issued.\n\nConsequently, the court quashed the impugned order and remanded the matter back to the Controller of Patents for reconsideration, ensuring that the appellant would receive a fair hearing. The court mandated that the reassessment be conducted by a different officer and completed within two months, emphasizing that the new decision must be uninfluenced by the previous order. The appeal was thus allowed, and any related miscellaneous applications were dismissed as moot."}
{"ID": "id_57", "Summary": "In the matter concerning Mr. Tejas Pravin Dugad and others, the petitioners, who are directors of M/s. Ganraj Ispat Private Limited, sought relief under Article 226 of the Constitution of India against the Union of India and other respondents, including the Directorate General of GST Intelligence and the State of Maharashtra. The petitioners challenged the legality of proceedings initiated against them under the Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 (GST Act), claiming that the procedures outlined in the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) were not adhered to during the investigation.\n\nThe background of the case involves the arrest of Tushar Munot, a sole proprietor of M/s. Rutu Enterprises, in October 2020, followed by a search of the petitioners' company premises in November 2020, where documents were seized. The petitioners contended that they were informed of GST liabilities amounting to ₹84,00,046, which they deposited under protest, asserting their intention to contest the liability.\n\nThe petitioners argued that the prosecution was based on misconceptions and that the necessary provisions of the CrPC were not followed, rendering the actions against them illegal. They sought a writ of mandamus to quash the proceedings and stay any coercive actions against them.\n\nIn response, the respondents maintained that no summons had been issued to the petitioners and that the investigation was conducted in accordance with the powers granted under the GST Act. They alleged that the petitioners were involved in fraudulent activities, including the issuance of fake invoices to avail input tax credit, leading to significant tax evasion.\n\nThe court examined the arguments presented by both parties, noting that the GST Act contains specific provisions that govern the investigation and prosecution of offences under the Act, which may differ from the CrPC. The court highlighted that the provisions of the GST Act take precedence in cases involving GST-related offences, allowing for simultaneous adjudication and prosecution.\n\nUltimately, the court dismissed all petitions, concluding that the petitioners had not demonstrated any illegality in the proceedings against them. The court imposed costs of ₹25,000 on each petitioner, to be deposited within four weeks, acknowledging the expenses incurred by the respondents in defending the case. The decision underscored the seriousness of white-collar offences and the necessity for compliance with the statutory framework governing GST investigations."}
{"ID": "id_573", "Summary": "In the case WP(C) No. 267 of 2021, Nisha Sharma, the petitioner, challenged the judgment of the Central Administrative Tribunal, Jammu, which dismissed her application TA No. 61/37 of 2020. The Tribunal's order, dated 12.02.2021, upheld the advertisement issued on 06.02.2019 for two posts of Lady Assistant Zila Sainik Welfare Officer, one for Jammu and another for Srinagar, and declined to extend the petitioner’s contractual appointment.\n\nThe petitioner argued that her service conditions allowed for a contractual appointment of three years, extendable up to a maximum of 12 years or until she reached the age of 60. However, the court noted that while the appointment was indeed contractual and extendable, it was not mandatory for the authorities to extend it. The petitioner was initially appointed on 23.04.2013 for three years, and her contract was extended for another three years, after which it expired, leading to the cessation of her employment.\n\nThe Tribunal found that the petitioner had no inherent right to continue in her position beyond the contractual term, emphasizing that a contractual appointment concludes upon the expiration of the contract unless renewed. The court further clarified that the service conditions did not guarantee an extension of service for the full 12 years or until the age of 60, and no legal provision prevented the replacement of a contractual employee after the contract's expiration.\n\nAdditionally, the posts were created to benefit widows and wives of armed forces personnel, highlighting the need to provide opportunities to a broader group of eligible candidates rather than allowing one individual to monopolize the position. Given that the petitioner had already served for six years, the court deemed it reasonable for the respondents to seek new appointments for these posts.\n\nUltimately, the court found no merit in the petition, affirming the Tribunal's decision and dismissing the case along with any connected applications."}

The appeal challenged the High Court's order dated 02.06.2022, which had previously considered the arguments from both the appellant and the respondent-State. The High Court's decision was based on a thorough examination of the competing claims presented.\n\nThe crux of the appeal centered on the appellant's request for the quashing of the FIR and any subsequent proceedings against him. Notably, the complainant, in an affidavit submitted with IA No. 153718 of 2023, acknowledged that the allegations against the appellant stemmed from a misunderstanding. The complainant expressed a desire to withdraw the complaint against the appellant, indicating a lack of intent to pursue the matter further.\n\nTaking into account the complainant's retraction and the context of the High Court's ruling, the Court found that continuing with the FIR against the appellant would be inappropriate. Consequently, the Court set aside the High Court's order, allowing the appeal and quashing the FIR against the appellant. The Court clarified that its decision did not extend to any other aspects of the case or the remaining accused, leaving those matters unaddressed.\n\nThe judgment was delivered on 08-08-2023, with representation from both parties' counsel, and the application for impleadment was granted, with the delay condoned and notice issued.

{"ID": "id_578", "Summary": "In the writ petition filed by Jang Bahadur Kushwaha against the State of U.P. and five others, the petitioner raises significant concerns regarding the ongoing strike by the Tehsil Bar Association in Rasra, District Ballia, which has disrupted court functioning since January 31, 2023. The petitioner seeks a directive for the State Bar Council of Uttar Pradesh to take immediate action against the lawyers responsible for this strike, which is in defiance of several Supreme Court verdicts.\n\nOn January 19, 2024, the Bar Council's counsel claimed that the strike had ended and normal court operations had resumed. However, the court required clarification on the duration of the strike and the actions taken by the Bar Council regarding the ongoing situation. The Bar Council's written instructions indicated that while there was no current strike, they did not specify how long the lawyers had been abstaining from work.\n\nEvidence presented by the petitioner revealed that the lawyers had been on strike for various reasons unrelated to their profession, including the deaths of family members of advocates. Notably, on multiple occasions, the Bar Association called for strikes due to the deaths of individuals not directly connected to the legal profession, indicating a pattern of misuse of strike actions.\n\nThe court emphasized that strikes by lawyers, which halt judicial proceedings, are detrimental to the justice system, equating such actions to a temporary withdrawal of services that ultimately harms the delivery of justice. The court noted that the legal profession should not be treated like a trade union, as lawyers possess the means to address grievances through established legal channels rather than through strikes.\n\nThe court referenced several Supreme Court judgments that have established it as unprofessional for lawyers to refuse court attendance due to strikes called by Bar Associations. It reiterated that genuine grievances should be addressed through the Grievance Redressal Committee, which includes judicial officers and Bar Association representatives.\n\nThe court also highlighted the functions of the State Bar Council as outlined in the Advocates Act, 1961, which includes addressing misconduct among advocates and promoting legal aid. It called for the Bar Council of Uttar Pradesh to provide guidelines regarding the observance of condolences and the regulation of strikes, emphasizing the need for accountability among lawyers to uphold the dignity of the judicial system.\n\nThe court directed the Bar Council to present any existing guidelines on these matters and to report on actions taken concerning the ongoing strike. The case is scheduled for a fresh hearing on February 5, 2024."}
{"ID": "id_582", "Summary": "**Legal Summary of Bail Application in ECIR No. ECIR/HIU-II/14/2022**\n\n**Parties Involved:**\n- **Applicant:** Sh. Sanjay Singh, represented by Mr. Mohit Mathur, Sr. Advocate, and others.\n- **Respondent:** Directorate of Enforcement (ED), represented by Mr. S.V. Raju, ASG, and others.\n\n**Case Background:**\nThe applicant seeks bail under Section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, in connection with ECIR No. ECIR/HIU-II/14/2022, registered under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (PMLA). This case stems from a predicate offence investigated by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which registered an FIR on 17.08.2022 concerning alleged irregularities in the Delhi Liquor Policy for 2021-2022. The CBI's investigation revealed a conspiracy involving kickbacks and corruption among public servants and private entities in the liquor trade.\n\n**Key Allegations:**\nThe CBI alleges that the accused, including the applicant, conspired to exploit loopholes in the excise policy, resulting in substantial financial losses to the government and illegal gains for the conspirators. The applicant was arrested on 04.10.2023 and has been in judicial custody since then.\n\n**Arguments for Bail:**\n1. **Judicial Custody Duration:** The applicant has been in custody for an extended period without sufficient evidence to justify continued detention.\n2. **Lack of Material Evidence:** The applicant's counsel argues that the ED's case relies heavily on the statements of co-accused turned approver, Dinesh Arora, which are inconsistent and lack corroboration.\n3. **No Direct Involvement:** The applicant contends he is neither named in the FIR nor charge-sheeted in the predicate offence, and there is no recovery of proceeds of crime from him.\n4. **Procedural Violations:** The applicant's counsel claims that the arrest was based on assumptions rather than concrete evidence.\n\n**Arguments Against Bail:**\n1. **Seriousness of Charges:** The ED argues that the applicant is a key conspirator in a significant money laundering case, with evidence linking him to proceeds of crime amounting to Rs. 2 crores.\n2. **Corroborative Evidence:** The prosecution presents statements from multiple witnesses, including the approver, which indicate the applicant's involvement in the conspiracy and receipt of kickbacks.\n3. **Legal Framework of PMLA:** Under Section 45 of the PMLA, bail can only be granted if the court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to believe the applicant is not guilty and unlikely to commit further offences.\n\n**Court's Reasoning:**\nThe court emphasized that the twin conditions under Section 45 of the PMLA must be satisfied for bail. It noted that the evidence presented, including the statements of the approver and corroborating witnesses, established a prima facie case against the applicant. The court also highlighted that the applicant's involvement in the conspiracy, as outlined in the statements and corroborated by call detail records, could not be dismissed at this stage.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe court denied the bail application, citing the serious nature of the allegations and the substantial evidence against the applicant. It directed the trial court to expedite proceedings, ensuring the applicant's right to a fair trial while maintaining judicial integrity.\n\n**Final Ruling:**\nThe bail application of Sh. Sanjay Singh is dismissed, with a directive for expedited trial proceedings."}

The bail application was filed under Section 439 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.). The petitioner’s counsel argued that Jugal had no prior criminal record, a claim that the Public Prosecutor did not contest.\n\nConsidering the circumstances, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic which has delayed court proceedings, the court decided to grant bail without commenting on the merits of the case. The court ordered that Jugal be released on bail upon executing a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 with two sureties of Rs. 25,000 each, ensuring his appearance at all scheduled hearings until the trial's conclusion.\n\nThe court also noted the absence of information regarding the petitioner’s criminal antecedents in the lower court's order, highlighting a common issue where trial courts fail to provide complete antecedent details, which can lead to delays in bail applications. The court emphasized the necessity for trial courts to include comprehensive antecedent reports in their orders, whether the accused has prior records or not. This report should detail any previous FIRs, case numbers, sections, dates, and statuses of arrests and releases.\n\nTo ensure compliance, the court directed that this order be communicated to all District and Sessions Judges in Rajasthan, mandating that they implement these requirements in future bail hearings. The Public Prosecutors were also instructed to obtain antecedent reports in advance for all bail cases. The court scheduled a follow-up on this matter for January 5, 2021, to ensure adherence to the new procedural requirements."}

The marriage was solemnized on 19.06.2002, and two children were born from this union. \n\n**Procedural History:**  \nThe appellant initially obtained an ex parte divorce decree on 03.08.2016, which was later recalled upon the respondent's application on 24.05.2018. The divorce petition was restored, and the respondent filed a written statement denying the allegations. The appellant subsequently amended his petition to include new allegations of cruelty, supported by testimonies from witnesses.\n\n**Arguments:**  \n- **Appellant's Contentions:** The appellant argued that the Family Court failed to consider the evidence demonstrating the respondent's cruelty, citing multiple false criminal cases filed against him by the respondent, which he claimed were intended to harass him. He contended that the continuous legal battles and the respondent's behavior constituted mental cruelty, leading to an irretrievable breakdown of their marriage. The appellant referenced the Supreme Court's judgments in *Naveen Kohli Vs. Neelu Kohli* and *K. Srinivas Rao Vs. D.A. Deepa* to support his claims.\n\n- **Respondent's Contentions:** The respondent, Pratibha Jha, argued that she had not committed any acts of cruelty and that the appellant had also filed false complaints against her. She claimed that their relationship deteriorated due to the appellant's extramarital affair and his wrongful actions regarding their joint business. The respondent maintained that the appellant failed to prove any cruelty on her part.\n\n**Judgment:**  \nThe Court found that while the appellant did not conclusively establish cruelty in their day-to-day life, the respondent's actions, including filing false complaints, contributed to the breakdown of the marriage. The Court noted that both parties had been living separately since 2013, and attempts at reconciliation had failed. Citing precedents, the Court recognized that forcing the parties to remain married under such circumstances would amount to cruelty.\n\nThe Court ultimately set aside the Family Court's order and dissolved the marriage on the grounds of cruelty and irretrievable breakdown. The appellant was ordered to pay the respondent a sum of Rs. 1,00,00,000 (One Crore) as permanent alimony, to be paid within three months, with interest accruing at 6% per annum if not paid timely.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe dissolution of marriage was granted based on established cruelty and the irretrievable breakdown of the marital relationship, reflecting the Court's commitment to ensuring justice while considering the welfare of both parties involved."}

Radha, the licensee of shop No.505, reported her rent was raised from ₹1,156 to ₹7,400 retroactively from July 1, 2016, while Mangayarkarasi's rent for shop No.2-GF-M increased from ₹1,704 to ₹8,450 for the same period.\n\nThe petitioners argued for an interim stay on the rent increase, referencing similar cases where interim stays were granted pending appeals. However, the court emphasized that previous writ petitions by similarly situated shop owners had been dismissed on merits, and discretionary interim orders do not set binding precedents. The court highlighted the importance of municipal revenue and the potential adverse effects of prolonged stays on public welfare initiatives.\n\nThe court reiterated the constitutional mandate under Article 226(3) of the Constitution of India, which requires that applications to vacate interim orders be disposed of within two weeks. Failure to do so results in automatic vacation of the interim order, a provision deemed mandatory by several High Courts, including Rajasthan and Calcutta. The court criticized the registry for delays in listing such applications, which could lead to financial losses for the state.\n\nUltimately, the court dismissed both writ petitions, affirming the validity of the rent increases as reasonable and in the public interest, and ordered the petitioners to comply with the revised rents or vacate the premises. The court also directed the High Court registry to ensure timely listing of vacate stay petitions to prevent injustice and financial loss to the state."}
{"ID": "id_612", "Summary": "In a series of writ petitions filed under Article 32 of the Indian Constitution, the Supreme Court examined the implications of Article 324, particularly Article 324(2), which governs the composition and appointment of the Election Commission of India. The Court noted that the Election Commission consists of the Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) and other Election Commissioners, appointed by the President, subject to any law made by Parliament.\n\nThe petitions highlighted concerns regarding the current appointment process, which is perceived as lacking transparency and fairness, potentially undermining the independence of the Election Commission. The petitioners sought a mandamus to compel the Union Government to establish a more robust and impartial selection process, advocating for the formation of a neutral collegium to recommend appointments.\n\nThe Court, recognizing the significance of the matter, referred the issue to a Constitution Bench for a definitive interpretation. The Bench emphasized the necessity of an independent Election Commission to uphold democratic values and ensure free and fair elections, which are fundamental to the Constitution's basic structure.\n\nThe Court reviewed various past judgments and reports, including those from the Dinesh Goswami Committee and the Law Commission, which recommended reforms to the appointment process. It was noted that the absence of a specific law governing these appointments creates a constitutional vacuum, leading to arbitrary practices.\n\nUltimately, the Court ruled that the appointment of the CEC and Election Commissioners should be made based on recommendations from a three-member committee comprising the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, and the Chief Justice of India. This structure aims to enhance accountability and reduce executive influence over the Election Commission. The Court also suggested that the grounds for removal of Election Commissioners should align with those of the CEC, thereby reinforcing their independence.\n\nThe Court's decision underscores the importance of a transparent and accountable electoral process, reflecting the aspirations of the Indian populace for a robust democracy. The ruling mandates that these guidelines remain in effect until Parliament enacts a law to formalize the appointment process, thereby addressing the long-standing concerns regarding the integrity of the electoral system in India."}
{"ID": "id_618", "Summary": "On October 13, 2023, the Supreme Court of India convened to hear a petition involving significant procedural matters related to the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT). The petitioners, represented by senior advocates including Mr. Neeraj Kishan Kaul and Mr. Abhinav Agrawal, sought to address the implications of a prior order issued by the Court on September 20, 2023, which had set aside the NCLAT's directive to restore the status quo ante after the conclusion of arguments in a case reserved for judgment. The Court emphasized that any actions taken must adhere to the final outcome of the NCLAT proceedings.\n\nThe Court expressed a prima facie view that the NCLAT's mandate could not be circumvented by delaying the declaration of results until a judgment was rendered. Consequently, the Court issued a notice returnable on October 30, 2023, and dispensed with the personal presence of the contemnors, pending further directions. It ordered the scrutinizer to promptly declare the results of the Annual General Meeting held on September 29, 2023, and instructed the NCLAT to issue its judgment in the pending appeal once it was informed of the AGM results.\n\nDuring the proceedings, it was reported that Mr. Ankur Saigal, present in Court, had communicated the Court's order to the NCLAT, requesting that the judgment be withheld until the scrutinizer's report was available. However, the NCLAT bench, comprising Mr. Rakesh Kumar and Dr. Alok Srivastava, proceeded to deliver its order, which, if true, would constitute a defiance of the Supreme Court's directive.\n\nIn light of these developments, the Supreme Court mandated an inquiry by the Chairperson of the NCLAT to verify whether the order was brought to the attention of the judges and the circumstances under which they delivered their judgment despite the Supreme Court's clear instructions. The Chairperson is required to submit a report by 5 PM on October 16, 2023, detailing the findings of this inquiry.

The petitioner argues that the Commissioner of Police should be restrained from registering any new FIRs under this section during the pendency of the case.\n\nThe court, represented by Mr. Kirtiman Singh for the Union of India (UOI) and Mr. Rahul Mehra for the State, acknowledges the application but notes that the petition does not qualify as a Public Interest Litigation (PIL). Consequently, the request for a general relief applicable to all cases invoking Section 4 is deemed impermissible. The court also addresses the petitioner's argument regarding the necessity of a larger bench for substantial constitutional questions, referencing Article 145(3) of the Constitution. The court finds no constitutional or legal basis for this request, affirming that the matter has been appropriately assigned to the current bench as per the Chief Justice's roster.\n\nOn the substantive issues, the petitioner contends that Section 3 of the Act, which renders the practice of triple talaq void and illegal, undermines the justification for criminalizing its pronouncement under Section 4, which prescribes penalties for such actions. The petitioner cites previous judgments, including Shayara Bano Vs. UOI and Behram Khurshid Pesikaka Vs. State of Bombay, to support this argument; however, the court finds that these cases do not substantiate the petitioner's claims.\n\nThe court emphasizes that legislation is presumed valid unless declared otherwise by a competent authority. It interprets Section 4 as a legislative effort to deter the traditional practice of triple talaq, asserting that the declaration of such practices as void does not preclude the legislature from criminalizing their continuation. Consequently, the court declines to grant any interim relief to the petitioner, and the case is adjourned sine die, allowing the parties to reapply following the Supreme Court's judgment."}

Following the retirement of Mr. Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul on December 25, 2023, the necessity to maintain full judicial strength prompted the Collegium to recommend a candidate for this vacancy.\n\nThe Collegium engaged in thorough deliberations regarding eligible Chief Justices and senior puisne Judges from various High Courts, supported by a compilation of relevant background materials. In making its recommendation, the Collegium considered several critical factors: the seniority of the judges, their merit, performance, and integrity, as well as the imperative of ensuring diversity and inclusion within the Supreme Court. This included representation from underrepresented High Courts, the appointment of individuals from marginalized communities, gender diversity, and minority representation.\n\nAfter a comprehensive evaluation of the qualifications and integrity of the candidates, the Collegium identified Mr. Justice Prasanna Bhalachandra Varale as a highly suitable candidate for appointment as a Supreme Court Judge. Mr. Justice Varale, who was appointed as a Judge of the High Court of Bombay on July 18, 2008, and later elevated to Chief Justice of the High Court of Karnataka on October 15, 2022, has demonstrated exceptional performance and integrity in his judicial capacity. His extensive experience encompasses a wide range of legal issues, and he has maintained high professional ethics throughout his career.\n\nNotably, Mr. Justice Varale is recognized as the senior-most Judge from a Scheduled Caste among High Court Judges and is the only Chief Justice from such a background among the Chief Justices of High Courts nationwide. The Collegium also acknowledged that there are currently three Judges from the High Court of Bombay serving on the Supreme Court bench.\n\nIn light of these considerations, the Collegium unanimously resolved to recommend Mr. Justice Prasanna B Varale for appointment as a Judge of the Supreme Court of India."}
{"ID": "id_638", "Summary": "In Writ Petition (Civil) No. 823/2022, heard on January 2, 2023, the petitioner, Mr. Ashok Pandey, an Advocate appearing in person, challenged the eligibility criteria for appointment as a Judge of the Supreme Court based on his interpretation of Article 217 of the Constitution. He argued that individuals who have shifted their practice from a State Bar Council to the Supreme Court should be deemed ineligible for such appointments. The petitioner highlighted that four names had been recommended from the Allahabad High Court for appointment, and noted that six individuals fitting this profile had been appointed in the last three years. He referenced letters from the President of the Supreme Court Bar Association, suggesting that the Court had acknowledged the superiority of lawyers practicing in the Supreme Court over those in the High Court.\n\nThe petitioner further contended that his interpretation of Article 217(2) warranted the matter being referred to a Constitution Bench. However, the Court found the petition to be meritless, stating that the interpretation proposed would imply that the Supreme Court is excluded from the pool of courts from which judges can be appointed to the High Court. The Court clarified that the appointment process involves recommendations from the High Court Collegium, which includes the Chief Justice and two senior judges, followed by government inputs and a decision from the Supreme Court Collegium.\n\nThe Court emphasized that there is no constitutional prohibition against appointing lawyers practicing in the Supreme Court as Judges of the High Court, and that all lawyers are enrolled with a State Bar Council. The views expressed by the President of the Bar Association do not carry the Court's endorsement, except for the general principle that advocates practicing in the Supreme Court may be considered for High Court appointments in appropriate cases. The Court concluded that the mere filing of the petition does not entitle the petitioner to a hearing before a Constitution Bench, and given the nature of the matter and the misuse of judicial time, the petition was dismissed with costs of Rs. 50,000 to be deposited within four weeks in the Supreme Court Mediation and Conciliation Project Committee (MCPC)."}
{"ID": "id_644", "Summary": "In the case presented, the appellant, represented by Mr. Inderpal Khokhar, challenges the Family Court's judgment and decree dated May 27, 2019, which granted a divorce to the respondent under Section 13(1)(ia) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, citing mental cruelty as the basis. The parties were married on December 2, 2007, and have one male child born on November 15, 2009, who is currently in the appellant's custody. \n\nDisputes arose leading the appellant to file a complaint with the CAW Cell, resulting in FIR No. 15/2013 against the respondent and his parents under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, including 498A and 406. The respondent and his parents were arrested, with the respondent spending three days in custody and his parents one day. Ultimately, they were acquitted on August 10, 2015, and the appeal against this acquittal was dismissed on January 29, 2016, indicating that the allegations were not substantiated.\n\nThe Family Court found that the appellant's actions constituted mental cruelty towards the respondent, as the serious allegations made were not proven, and the respondent's trust was irreparably damaged. The court emphasized that the mere lack of opposition to the bail application filed by the respondent and his parents did not mitigate the appellant's irresponsible conduct, which included pursuing unproven criminal allegations.\n\nThe Family Court's judgment referenced the Supreme Court's ruling in K. Srinivas Vs. K. Sunita, which established that filing a false criminal complaint constitutes matrimonial cruelty, thereby entitling the aggrieved spouse to a divorce. The Family Court concluded that the appellant had successfully established grounds for divorce due to cruelty, as the parties had been living separately for over seven years.\n\nThe appeal was dismissed, with the court noting that the appellant is entitled to seek permanent alimony and that the respondent has an obligation to maintain the minor child. The matter regarding permanent alimony and child maintenance is set for consideration, with notice issued to the respondent, returnable on December 10, 2021."}

{"ID": "id_676", "Summary": "On June 13, 2022, the High Court addressed multiple writ petitions concerning violent protests in West Bengal, specifically WPA (P) 258, 256, 259, and 260 of 2022. The petitioners, including Niladri Saha, Devdutta Maji, Masum Ali Sardar, and Paramita Dey, alleged that since June 9, 2022, protests had escalated into significant public disorder, resulting in extensive property damage and threats to public safety. The petitioners claimed that the police failed to act against unruly mobs, which engaged in violent acts such as burning vehicles, attacking passengers, and vandalizing local businesses, including BJP party offices and various shops.\n\nIn WPA (P) 258 of 2022, the petitioners requested the deployment of military or Central Para Military Forces to restore order and urged the National Investigation Agency (NIA) to investigate the incidents. WPA (P) 256 of 2022 echoed similar concerns, seeking accountability for those responsible for blocking National Highway No. 6 and demanding stringent actions against them to prevent future occurrences. WPA (P) 260 of 2022 also raised issues regarding the potential for further unrest during religious processions.\n\nThe petitioners argued that the state police's inaction and failure to maintain law and order necessitated intervention from central forces. The Advocate General for the State acknowledged the protests were triggered by inflammatory remarks made by individuals, leading to unrest not only in West Bengal but also in other states. He reported that 26 FIRs had been registered, 240 arrests made, and prohibitory orders issued, alongside internet suspensions in affected districts.\n\nIn contrast, WPA (P) 259 of 2022 sought to allow peaceful processions and challenged the imposition of Section 144 of the Cr.P.C. The Advocate General requested an adjournment to provide a detailed affidavit on the current situation and the measures taken by the state to control the unrest.\n\nThe Court expressed hope that state authorities would take all necessary steps to maintain peace and prevent further incidents. It emphasized the need for immediate action if the state police could not manage the situation, including the potential calling of central forces. The Court also directed the collection of video evidence to identify perpetrators and discussed the issue of compensation for those who suffered property losses due to the violence. The matter was scheduled for further hearing on June 15, 2022."}

The petitioners include various trusts and non-profit organizations engaged in social welfare activities.\n\n**Facts:**\nThe petitioners argue that the amendments, particularly Sections 7, 12(1A), 12A, and 17(1), are arbitrary and infringe upon their fundamental rights under Articles 14, 19, and 21 of the Constitution. The amendments impose stringent regulations on the receipt and utilization of foreign contributions, including a complete prohibition on transferring foreign contributions to other entities and mandating that contributions be received only in a designated account at the State Bank of India, New Delhi.\n\n**Arguments:**\n1. **Petitioners' Claims:**\n   - The amendments violate the right to equality and freedom of association by imposing unreasonable restrictions.\n   - Section 7's prohibition on transferring foreign contributions is overly broad and arbitrary.\n   - Section 12A's requirement for Aadhaar numbers as identification for office bearers is an invasion of privacy.\n   - Section 17(1) restricts operational flexibility by mandating a single bank for receiving contributions.\n\n2. **Respondents' Defense:**\n   - The amendments are necessary to enhance transparency and accountability in the utilization of foreign contributions.\n   - The legislative intent is to prevent misuse and ensure that contributions are used for the intended purposes.\n   - The provisions do not infringe upon fundamental rights but rather regulate the acceptance of foreign contributions in the interest of national sovereignty and integrity.\n\n**Decision:**\nThe Supreme Court upheld the validity of the amendments, stating that:\n- The restrictions imposed by the amendments are reasonable and serve a legitimate state interest in regulating foreign contributions.\n- The complete prohibition on transferring foreign contributions is justified to prevent misuse and ensure accountability.\n- The requirement for Aadhaar numbers is permissible, with the provision allowing for alternative identification methods for foreign nationals.\n- The amendments are consistent with the objectives of the FCRA and do not violate the fundamental rights of the petitioners.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe Court declared that the amended provisions of the FCRA, specifically Sections 7, 12(1A), 12A, and 17, are constitutional and serve the purpose of safeguarding national interests while regulating foreign contributions effectively. The petitions were disposed of without any order as to costs."}

The appellant was accused of humiliating the prosecutrix, a member of the Scheduled Caste, during an incident at her workplace, where he allegedly made derogatory remarks regarding her caste after she rejected his advances.\n\nThe prosecutrix reported that on January 25, 2022, while working as a receptionist, the appellant entered her office with four associates, disregarding her request to sign the visitors' book. Following a confrontation with her employer, the appellant allegedly insulted her in front of colleagues, using caste-related slurs, which prompted her to file a complaint.\n\nThe Special Judge denied bail, citing prima facie evidence supporting the allegations under Sections 3(1)(r) and 3(1)(s) of the SC and ST Act, which prohibit discrimination and humiliation based on caste. The appellant contended that the FIR did not specify his caste, arguing that the prosecution must prove he is not a member of a Scheduled Caste or Tribe for the charges to apply. He referenced previous judgments to support his claim that the absence of such information in the FIR undermined the case against him.\n\nHowever, the court clarified that while the prosecution must establish the accused's caste status, this does not necessitate its inclusion in the FIR. The court emphasized that the intent to insult or humiliate based on caste must be assessed in context, and mere reference to caste in allegations can suffice for charges under the SC and ST Act. The court also noted that the prosecutrix's humiliation occurred in public view, further substantiating the charges.\n\nUltimately, the court upheld the Special Judge's decision, affirming that the evidence presented warranted the denial of anticipatory bail, as the allegations met the criteria for offences under the SC and ST Act. The appeal was dismissed, with the court clarifying that its findings were limited to the bail application and did not reflect on the merits of the case."}
{"ID": "id_691", "Summary": "In the case of Rajib Samanta versus The State of West Bengal & Ors., the petitioner, represented by Mr. Rajdeep Majumder and others, challenged an ex parte order issued on August 18, 2023, by the Sub Divisional Magistrate of Contai, Purba Medinipur, under Section 144(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Cr.P.C.), which prohibited a political rally planned for August 19, 2023. The petitioner, who is the Mandal President of an opposition political party, had notified the local police about the rally on August 14, 2023. However, the order was promulgated just a day before the event, compelling the petitioner to reschedule the rally to August 26, 2023.\n\nThe petitioner argued that the order was a deliberate attempt to suppress democratic rights, lacking any reference to specific criminal cases or incidents that warranted such a restriction. He contended that the order was not valid beyond the specified date of August 19, 2023, and cited the Supreme Court's ruling in Babulal Parate v. State of Maharashtra, emphasizing that the Magistrate must demonstrate a necessity for immediate prevention of specific acts to justify the imposition of Section 144.\n\nIn response, the State's counsel highlighted reports indicating the registration of four criminal cases in the vicinity around the dates leading to the order, asserting that the administration deemed the order necessary to maintain public order. However, the court found that the impugned order did not adequately consider the conditions required under Section 144, as it failed to establish a clear and present danger to public safety or tranquility.\n\nAfter reviewing the submissions and the reports, the court concluded that the order was not justified and set it aside, affirming the need for the administration to ensure a level playing field for all political entities. The court directed that the petitioner be allowed to hold the rally on August 26, 2023, under specific conditions to ensure peace and order, including the nomination of responsible individuals to liaise with local authorities and adherence to sound regulations during the event.\n\nThe judgment emphasized the importance of safeguarding citizens' rights while maintaining law and order, ultimately disposing of the writ petition with the aforementioned directives."}
{"ID": "id_692", "Summary": "In the case before the Supreme Court, the appellants, Sudhir Vilas Kalel (Appellant No. 1) and Sushila Sitaram Kalel (Appellant No. 2), contested the validity of a No Confidence Motion against the latter, who served as the Sarpanch of Jambulani Gram Panchayat. The crux of the dispute hinged on whether Appellant No. 1 was a valid member of the Panchayat entitled to vote during the motion, which required a three-fourths majority to pass. The High Court had ruled against the appellants, prompting their appeal.\n\nThe legal question centered on Appellant No. 1's entitlement to vote, which depended on his membership status under the Maharashtra Temporary Extension of Period for Submitting Validity Certificate Act, 2023 (Temporary Extension Act). This Act allows individuals who applied for a Caste Validity Certificate before filing their nomination papers to submit the certificate within twelve months of the Act's commencement, provided their application was pending at that time.\n\nAppellant No. 1 had filed his nomination on December 30, 2020, but only applied for the Validity Certificate on the same day. The elections were held on January 18, 2021, and he was declared elected on January 21, 2021. He was required to submit the Validity Certificate by January 20, 2022, but failed to do so, leading to his automatic disqualification under the Maharashtra Village Panchayats Act, 1959.\n\nThe Supreme Court analyzed the statutory framework, including the Caste Certificate Act, 2000, and the Temporary Extension Act, emphasizing that candidates must diligently pursue their applications for Validity Certificates. The Court noted that Appellant No. 1's application was effectively rejected due to non-compliance with procedural requirements, and thus he could not claim the protections offered by the Temporary Extension Act.\n\nThe Court concluded that Appellant No. 1 was disqualified from being a member of the Panchayat, which meant the No Confidence Motion against Appellant No. 2 had indeed been validly carried, as the voting majority was calculated without Appellant No. 1's participation. Consequently, the Supreme Court upheld the High Court's decision, affirming the validity of the No Confidence Motion and directing that Appellant No. 2 cease her duties as Sarpanch, with a fresh election to be conducted for the position. The appeal was dismissed, and no costs were awarded."}

No. 1782/2023) filed by the petitioners, who were Civil Service aspirants participating in the Civil Services Examination 2023 (CSE-2023) conducted by the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC). The examination, comprising three stages, was still ongoing, with the petitioners having only completed the preliminary examination.\n\nThe petitioners contended that the General Studies Paper-II, or Civil Services Aptitude Test (CSAT), included numerous questions not aligned with the officially notified syllabus. They argued that despite being a qualifying paper, the performance in CSAT significantly impacted their chances in Paper-I, as only candidates meeting the 33% qualifying mark in CSAT would be considered for merit ranking. They claimed that the syllabus was intended to be at a Class X level, yet many questions pertained to advanced topics like Commutation, Permutation, and Combination, typically covered in higher education, thus disadvantaging candidates from humanities backgrounds.\n\nIn response, the UPSC asserted that the CSAT question paper was developed by a committee of experts, and the examination was conducted fairly and transparently, with no malafide intentions. They emphasized that the qualifying marks were established according to the examination rules and could not be altered for the petitioners' convenience.\n\nThe Tribunal, in its dismissal of the O.A., acknowledged the UPSC's reputation for conducting examinations fairly and noted that the petitioners had not provided sufficient evidence of any statutory violations or miscarriages of justice. The Tribunal emphasized its limited jurisdiction and the necessity to respect the expertise of the academic panel responsible for the question paper. It highlighted that the examination process involved over six lakh candidates, and the grievances of only fourteen petitioners could not warrant interference in such a large-scale examination.\n\nThe Tribunal further noted that the results of the preliminary examination had already been declared, with 14,624 candidates qualifying, none of whom were petitioners. The Tribunal concluded that the petitioners' claims lacked merit and dismissed the application, stating that it would not entertain challenges to the academic decisions of the expert panel unless clear evidence of arbitrariness or illegality was presented.\n\nThe High Court upheld the Tribunal's decision, reiterating that it could not question the expert panel's judgment regarding the examination content. The Court dismissed the petition and connected applications, affirming the integrity of the examination process and the UPSC's authority in setting examination standards. No costs were awarded."}

State of M.P. & Ors.**, the High Court of Madhya Pradesh addressed the urgent need to enforce Covid-19 protocols during political gatherings amid rising infection rates in Gwalior. On October 3, 2020, the Court issued interim orders directing District Magistrates across nine districts to invoke the Disaster Management Act and the Indian Penal Code against individuals and political functionaries violating these protocols during election campaigns. \n\nDespite these measures, reports indicated continued large gatherings by political parties, prompting the Court to issue a stricter interim order on October 12, 2020, mandating the registration of cognizable offenses against violators, particularly targeting political leaders. The amicus curiae highlighted ongoing breaches of social distancing and mask-wearing guidelines, suggesting that candidates violating these protocols should be disqualified from campaigning or that elections be postponed until the pandemic situation improved.\n\nDuring the proceedings, the Advocate General presented documents revealing multiple FIRs lodged against political candidates for violating Covid-19 protocols, yet notable political figures, including Union Minister Shri Narendra Singh Tomar and former Chief Minister Shri Kamal Nath, had not faced similar actions. The Court emphasized the necessity of equal enforcement of the law, leading to assurances from the Additional Advocate General that FIRs would be filed against these leaders.\n\nThe Court underscored the conflict between the right to campaign and the fundamental right to life and health, asserting that the latter must take precedence. It recognized the importance of election campaigns but stressed that they should not compromise public health. The Court noted the Election Commission's non-mandatory guidelines for virtual campaigning and urged candidates to adopt such methods to mitigate health risks.\n\nConsequently, the Court issued an interim order prohibiting District Magistrates from allowing physical gatherings unless candidates could demonstrate the impossibility of virtual campaigning, with any such permissions requiring prior approval from the Election Commission. Additionally, candidates must provide sufficient resources for health safety measures at any permitted gatherings. The Court mandated the registration of FIRs against the aforementioned political leaders and ordered continued enforcement of prior interim orders until the next hearing.\n\nThis ruling reflects the Court's commitment to balancing electoral rights with public health imperatives during the ongoing pandemic, ensuring that political activities do not endanger the lives of citizens."}

The applicant's counsel, Mr. N.S. Giripunje, argued that this practice aligns with a precedent set by the Division Bench in Arjun Kishanrao Malge vs. State of Maharashtra, which purportedly supported such inclusion.\n\nHowever, upon review, the court found no directive from the Division Bench mandating the victim's inclusion as a party in appeals against convictions under the POCSO Act. The court clarified that while Section 40 of the POCSO Act entitles the family or guardian of a child to legal assistance, it does not necessitate their presence as a party in appellate proceedings. The court emphasized that the victim's family should be informed of the case's status but should not be compelled to participate in the appeal process.\n\nThe court further examined relevant provisions of the POCSO Rules, particularly Rule 4, which outlines the responsibilities of the Special Juvenile Police Unit (SJPU) and local police in safeguarding the child's interests and ensuring they are informed about the proceedings. The court noted that while the victim's family is entitled to updates, their presence in court is not obligatory, especially in applications for suspension of sentence where the appellate court can rely on the prosecutor's representation.\n\nThe court referenced a judgment from the Calcutta High Court, which similarly concluded that the victim is not a necessary party in criminal appeals stemming from convictions under the IPC or POCSO Act. The court reiterated that the victim's family should be notified of proceedings but should not be required to attend unless specifically directed.\n\nUltimately, the court ordered the removal of the victim's name from the appeal and application, reinforcing that the victim's presence is not mandatory in such cases. The court directed the Registry to process applications under Sections 439 and 389 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, ensuring that the victim's family is informed of the proceedings without necessitating their court attendance. The court also instructed the Director General of Police to issue guidelines to ensure that child victims are not unnecessarily brought to court, thereby alleviating the burden on families, particularly those from economically weaker backgrounds."}

APP (DB) No. 98 of 2015 dated 25-07-2022**\n\n**Parties Involved:**\n- **Appellant:** ‘F’ (name changed for anonymity)\n- **Respondent:** The State of Bihar\n\n**Background:**\nThe appellant, referred to as ‘F’, challenges the conviction and sentencing by the 1st Additional Sessions Judge-cum-Special Judge (POCSO), Bhojpur, for committing aggravated penetrative sexual assault against his two minor daughters, D-1 and D-2, under Sections 376(i) of the Indian Penal Code and Sections 6 and 10 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (POCSO Act). The appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment for the offence under Section 6 of the POCSO Act and five years of rigorous imprisonment for the offence under Section 10, with both sentences running concurrently.\n\n**Facts of the Case:**\nThe prosecution alleges that the appellant repeatedly sexually assaulted his eldest daughter, D-1, from 2007 until the FIR was lodged on 30-07-2013. Following the death of the appellant's wife in 2007, the assaults intensified, with D-1 eventually reporting the abuse to the Mahila Police Station. The FIR led to the registration of Crime No. 56 of 2013 against the appellant.\n\nD-1 testified that her father threatened her and her younger sister, D-2, to prevent them from disclosing the abuse. She described instances where the appellant administered sleep-inducing drugs to facilitate the assaults and mentioned a pregnancy in 2009, which resulted in an abortion arranged by the appellant.\n\nThe investigation was conducted by the Station House Officer, who recorded witness statements and arranged medical examinations for both victims. Medical evidence indicated that D-1 was between 17 to 19 years old at the time of examination, corroborating her claims of being a minor during the assaults.\n\n**Arguments:**\nThe appellant's defense argued that the prosecution failed to prove the victims' ages and that the evidence presented was insufficient to establish guilt. The defense also claimed that the allegations were fabricated due to personal vendettas, particularly from the victims' maternal aunt, who allegedly wanted to marry the appellant.\n\n**Judgment:**\nThe Patna High Court upheld the trial court's findings, emphasizing the credibility of the victims' testimonies, which were consistent and corroborated by medical evidence. The court noted that the victims had no motive to falsely implicate their father, and the evidence presented was sufficient to establish the appellant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nThe court reiterated the legal principle that the testimony of a victim in sexual assault cases holds significant weight, especially when corroborated by medical evidence. The court dismissed the appeal, affirming the conviction and sentences imposed by the trial court.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe appeal was dismissed, and the conviction of the appellant for aggravated penetrative sexual assault against his minor daughters was upheld, reinforcing the legal protections afforded to children under the POCSO Act and the Indian Penal Code. The court emphasized the need for sensitivity in handling cases of sexual violence, particularly involving minors."}

The petitioner contended that these provisions undermine the independence of the judiciary and the principle of separation of powers.\n\n**Key Provisions Challenged:**\n1. **Sections 12 and 13 of the Ordinance**: These sections impose restrictions on the appointment of tribunal members, including a minimum age requirement of 50 years.\n2. **Sections 184 and 186(2) of the Finance Act, 2017**: These sections govern the conditions of service for tribunal members, including their tenure and eligibility.\n\n**Arguments:**\n- The petitioner argued that the age restriction is arbitrary and discriminatory, effectively barring competent younger advocates from appointment.\n- It was asserted that the provisions infringe upon the independence of the judiciary, as they impose undue restrictions on the appointment and tenure of tribunal members.\n- The petitioner sought a declaration that the challenged provisions are ultra vires the Constitution and requested the establishment of a separate wing to address tribunal requirements.\n\n**Judicial Reasoning:**\n1. **Historical Context**: The court reviewed the evolution of tribunals in India, tracing back to the 42nd Amendment, which introduced Articles 323-A and 323-B to facilitate the establishment of administrative tribunals to alleviate the burden on High Courts.\n2. **Precedent Cases**: The court referenced previous judgments, including *S.P. Sampath Kumar v. Union of India* and *L. Chandra Kumar v. Union of India*, which emphasized the necessity of maintaining judicial review and the independence of the judiciary.\n3. **Separation of Powers**: The court underscored that the independence of the judiciary is a fundamental aspect of the Constitution's basic structure, and any legislative action that undermines this principle is unconstitutional.\n\n**Court's Findings:**\n- The first proviso to Section 184(1), which sets a minimum age of 50 years for tribunal appointments, was declared unconstitutional as it violates the principles of equality and non-discrimination under Article 14.\n- The second and third provisos regarding allowances and benefits were also struck down for being inconsistent with the court's previous directives regarding the conditions of service for tribunal members.\n- Section 184(7), which mandated the recommendation of two names for each post by the Selection Committee, was deemed unconstitutional as it contradicted the court's earlier rulings.\n\n**Final Ruling:**\nThe court ruled in favor of the petitioner, declaring the challenged provisions void and unconstitutional. It reinstated the earlier directive that tribunal members should have a term of five years, with eligibility for reappointment, and emphasized the need for appointments to be made without arbitrary age restrictions. The court also highlighted the urgent need for the Union to expedite the filling of vacancies in tribunals to ensure effective administration of justice.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe judgment reinforces the principles of judicial independence and the separation of powers, asserting that legislative measures must not infringe upon the judiciary's role or undermine the rights of individuals seeking justice through tribunals. The court's decision aims to restore public confidence in the judicial system and ensure that tribunals function effectively as part of the justice delivery mechanism in India."}

Additionally, the petitioner seeks to remove any barriers to his access to the office premises and to prevent Respondent No. 1 from soliciting clients or making false representations regarding the partnership status.\n\nDuring the hearing, Mr. Nigam expressed the petitioner’s willingness to mediate the dispute, provided that a status quo ante is maintained. In contrast, Dr. Singhvi and Mr. Kaul indicated that Respondent No. 1 is open to mediation but without the condition of restoring the previous status.\n\nThe court, acknowledging the parties' inclination towards mediation, appointed Mr. Sriram Panchu as the mediator and directed both parties to meet with him on October 17, 2020, or alternatively on October 18, 2020, if necessary. The mediator is granted the discretion to set his fees, which will be shared equally by the parties. The court also permitted the parties to communicate this order to the mediator via email or WhatsApp and encouraged them to provide a brief note for his consideration.\n\nThe case is scheduled for further listing on October 20, 2020, to monitor the progress of the mediation process."}
{"ID": "id_740", "Summary": "**Legal Summary of Criminal Appeal Nos. 590-591 of 2021**\n\nThis case involves an appeal by Somesh Chaurasia against the State of Madhya Pradesh concerning the High Court's order dated July 23, 2019, which denied two applications for revocation of bail and suspension of sentence for the second respondent, Govind Singh, who had been convicted under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and sentenced to life imprisonment. The High Court had previously suspended his sentence pending appeal on February 3, 2016.\n\nThe appellant and the State filed applications seeking cancellation of Govind Singh's bail, citing his criminal history, including two prior murder convictions and a new FIR (No. 143 of 2019) alleging his involvement in the murder of the appellant's father while on bail. The High Court, however, chose not to revoke the bail, stating that further investigation was warranted and directed that it be completed within 90 days.\n\nSubsequent developments revealed that despite the issuance of a warrant for his arrest, Govind Singh evaded capture, leading to concerns about police complicity in shielding him due to his political connections, as his spouse is an MLA. The Additional Sessions Judge (ASJ) expressed apprehensions about being pressured by law enforcement due to his orders related to the case.\n\nThe Supreme Court took serious note of the ASJ's concerns and the failure of the police to apprehend Govind Singh, ultimately directing the Director General of Police (DGP) to ensure his arrest. The DGP's initial explanations for the lack of action were deemed unacceptable, prompting the Court to emphasize the need for adherence to the rule of law.\n\nOn March 28, 2021, Govind Singh was finally arrested. The Supreme Court found that the High Court had erred in its decision to allow the second respondent to remain on bail despite serious allegations against him, including committing murder while his sentence was suspended. The Court highlighted the importance of judicial independence and the need to protect the integrity of the judicial process from political influence.\n\nConsequently, the Supreme Court set aside the High Court's order, cancelled Govind Singh's bail, and directed that he be moved to another jail to ensure the fair conduct of the ongoing criminal proceedings. The Court also mandated an inquiry into the ASJ's concerns regarding undue pressure from law enforcement, underscoring the necessity of maintaining judicial independence and the integrity of the legal system.\n\nIn conclusion, the Supreme Court's ruling reinforces the principles governing the cancellation of bail in serious criminal cases, particularly when new allegations arise during the period of suspension, and emphasizes the judiciary's role in safeguarding the rule of law against external influences."}

No. 20475 of 2021) filed by Kasmira Bibi against the State of West Bengal and others, represented by Mr. Rwitendra Banerjee. Despite the court's order on February 8, 2023, the private respondents failed to appear. The petitioner, who has sought assistance from the State Legal Services Authority, reported ongoing torture by her in-laws, the private respondents.\n\nThe Kandi Police Station submitted a report on February 15, 2023, indicating that 11 FIRs had been lodged against the in-laws, including Hasan Sk., Sahatulla Sk., Jamela Bibi, Akbor Sk., and Nusnehar Bibi. Notably, ten of these FIRs have led to charge-sheets under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, including Sections 498A, 323, 376, and 354, reflecting serious allegations of domestic violence and sexual offenses.\n\nThe court expressed concern over the Kandi Police's failure to oppose bail for the accused before the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, despite the gravity of the charges and the multiple charge-sheets filed. The court deemed the situation extraordinary, highlighting the continuous oppression faced by the petitioner and the prima facie establishment of serious charges against the accused.\n\nConsequently, the court canceled the bail granted to the accused on February 6, 2023, invoking its powers under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. It ordered the immediate custody of the accused and mandated the Kandi Police to establish a police presence outside the petitioner’s residence to ensure her safety and peace. The court directed the Kandi Police to submit a further report on the adjourned date, scheduled for February 28, 2023, and allowed the petitioner to utilize all amenities in her home. The counsel for the petitioner was also granted the liberty to mention the matter in case of any urgency. All parties were instructed to act on a server copy of the order downloaded from the court's official website."}
{"ID": "id_744", "Summary": "In the case of Rajshree vs. State of Maharashtra, the Applicant challenged the order dated March 1, 2019, from the Additional Sessions Judge at Dindoshi, which denied her application for discharge from charges of rape and assault. The complaint, lodged by the prosecutrix on February 17, 2016, detailed a relationship that began in 2008, evolving from friendship to a romantic bond, with both families aware of their intentions to marry. The prosecutrix alleged that the Applicant engaged in forcible sexual intercourse under the pretext of marriage, claiming that while some encounters were consensual, others were not.\n\nThe court noted that the prosecutrix, being of mature age, had the capacity to understand the implications of her actions. It was emphasized that the relationship lasted for eight years, during which the prosecutrix admitted to consensual physical relations, suggesting that the promise of marriage was not the sole reason for her consent. The court referenced the Supreme Court's distinction between a false promise of marriage and a mere breach of promise, indicating that consent given under a misconception of fact does not equate to non-consent.\n\nThe court further analyzed the prosecutrix's statements, concluding that her consent was not solely based on the promise of marriage, but also on her emotional attachment to the Applicant. The allegations of assault were deemed vague and lacking in detail. Ultimately, the court found insufficient grounds to proceed with charges under Section 376 of the Indian Penal Code, leading to the decision to discharge the Applicant from the case, as the relationship dynamics did not support the claims of non-consensual acts. The revision application was thus allowed, and the impugned order was set aside."}

Phukan (Public Prosecutor, Assam)\n- **Respondents:** Mr. S. Nawaz (Counsel for Respondent No.1), Ms. Padmini Baruah (Counsel for Proforma Respondent No.2, Chief Minister of Assam, Dr. Himanta Biswa Sarma)\n\n**Facts of the Case:**\nThe case arises from a petition filed under Section 482 read with Section 397 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, seeking to quash an order dated 05.03.2022, issued by the learned S.D.J.M. (S)-I, Kamrup (M), Guwahati. The order directed the Officer-in-Charge of Dispur Police Station to register a case based on a First Information Report (FIR) lodged by Abdul Khaleque, a Member of Parliament, alleging that the Chief Minister of Assam made inflammatory statements during a public speech on 10.12.2021, which incited communal disharmony and violated Sections 153 and 153-A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).\n\n**Central Allegations:**\nThe FIR claimed that the Chief Minister's remarks regarding the eviction exercise at Gorukhuti were communal in nature and incited violence against the Muslim community. The complainant argued that the Chief Minister's statements justified past violence and encouraged further communal strife.\n\n**Procedural History:**\n1. The FIR was lodged on 29.12.2021, but the Officer-in-Charge of Dispur Police Station conducted a preliminary inquiry and found no grounds for investigation, notifying the Deputy Commissioner of Police.\n2. Following this, the complainant filed an application under Section 154(3) Cr.P.C. and subsequently a Complaint Petition under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. before the learned S.D.J.M. (S)-I, which led to the impugned order.\n\n**Arguments:**\n- **Petitioners' Argument:** The petitioners contended that the learned Magistrate failed to consider the full context of the speech and the preliminary inquiry report, which found no cognizable offence. They argued that the FIR did not disclose any actionable offence under the IPC and that the learned Magistrate acted without proper application of mind.\n- **Respondent's Argument:** The respondent's counsel maintained that the FIR disclosed cognizable offences and that the learned Magistrate was correct in directing the police to register the case.\n\n**Judgment and Reasoning:**\nThe High Court found that the learned Magistrate had erred in directing the registration of the FIR without adequately considering the evidence, including the full text of the speech delivered by the Chief Minister. The Court emphasized that the allegations in the FIR did not constitute a cognizable offence as defined under Sections 153 and 153-A IPC. The Court also noted procedural lapses, including the lack of opportunity for the Chief Minister to be heard before the order was passed.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe High Court allowed the petition, quashing the impugned order dated 05.03.2022, thereby preventing the registration of the FIR against the Chief Minister. The Court underscored the necessity for judicial scrutiny and adherence to procedural fairness in matters involving allegations against public officials.\n\n**Key Legal Principles:**\n- The registration of an FIR is mandatory if it discloses a cognizable offence; however, if it does not, a preliminary inquiry may be conducted.\n- The learned Magistrate must apply judicial mind and consider all relevant materials before directing an investigation under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C.\n- The necessity of hearing all parties involved, especially in cases involving public officials, is crucial to ensure justice and prevent abuse of process."}

The petitioners sought a writ of mandamus to suspend construction in compliance with orders from the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) and to rescind a movement pass issued on April 19, 2021, which allowed construction activities to continue.\n\nThe petitioners argued that the DDMA's order imposed restrictions on movement and activities, mandating the closure of non-essential services, including construction, unless workers resided on-site. They contended that the movement pass was issued in violation of these restrictions, allowing vehicles for the project to operate under the erroneous assumption that the construction was essential. The petitioners highlighted the risks posed to workers and the public due to ongoing construction amidst rising COVID-19 cases, asserting that the project did not qualify as an essential service.\n\nIn response, the Solicitor General of India, Mr. Tushar Mehta, representing Respondents No. 1 and 2, argued that the project was vital for public infrastructure and that the construction activities complied with DDMA orders, as workers were residing on-site. He emphasized that the project included essential public amenities and was crucial for national events, such as the Republic Day celebrations. The court was informed that measures were in place to ensure worker safety, including health insurance, medical facilities, and adherence to COVID-19 protocols.\n\nThe court examined the DDMA orders and found that they permitted construction activities where workers resided on-site. It noted that the movement pass was valid and justified, as it facilitated the transportation of materials and workers already on-site. The court concluded that the petitioners failed to substantiate their claims of a breach of DDMA orders and that the construction was essential for public interest.\n\nUltimately, the court dismissed the petition, labeling it as motivated and lacking genuine public interest, imposing costs of ₹1,00,000 on the petitioners to be deposited with the Delhi State Legal Services Authority. The judgment underscored the importance of the Central Vista Project and affirmed the legality of the ongoing construction activities under the prevailing circumstances."}

The IPAB had dismissed the petitioner's request for an adjournment, citing the absence of representation and alleging that the lead counsel, Akshay Srivastava, misrepresented his availability by claiming to be in quarantine while evidence from his Facebook indicated he was on holiday.\n\nThe IPAB expressed regret over what it deemed irresponsible false representations and imposed costs of Rs. 5,000 on the petitioner, directing that the amount be deposited with the PM Cares Fund. The matter was also referred to the Bar Council of India for potential action against the counsels involved. \n\nUpon review, this Court noted that the presumption made by the IPAB regarding Akshay Srivastava being the lead counsel lacked sufficient justification, as Suwarn Rajan Chauhan was actually the arguing counsel who was under quarantine and unfortunately passed away shortly after the hearing. The Court criticized the IPAB for relying on social media evidence without allowing the counsel an opportunity to explain their circumstances, emphasizing that such postings should not be determinative of a person's location.\n\nThe Court found the IPAB's actions to be excessively strict and quashed the December 30 order, restoring the rectification petitions for re-hearing. Given that the IPAB has since been abolished, the Court directed that the petitions be heard by itself, with the registry instructed to register the petitions appropriately and list them for hearing on February 23, 2023. The interim relief granted to Respondent 2 prior to the impugned order was also restored, ensuring that the status quo prior to the IPAB's decision was maintained until the matter is resolved.\n\nIn conclusion, the writ petition was allowed, and the costs imposed by the IPAB were set aside, with no additional costs ordered by the Court."}

The petitioners, comprising industrialists and associations, argue that the Act imposes unreasonable restrictions on their fundamental rights under Article 19 of the Constitution, particularly the right to conduct business and trade.\n\n**Key Facts:**\n1. The 2020 Act mandates that private employers in Haryana must reserve 75% of jobs for local candidates (defined as those domiciled in Haryana) for positions with a gross monthly salary of less than ₹30,000.\n2. The petitioners contend that this law infringes upon their rights to equal employment opportunities and violates Articles 14, 19, and 21 of the Constitution.\n3. The State justifies the Act by citing the need to address local unemployment and protect the interests of Haryana's residents, arguing that it is a reasonable classification based on domicile.\n\n**Legal Arguments:**\n- **Petitioners' Arguments:**\n  - The Act violates the fundamental rights of citizens to move freely and reside anywhere in India (Articles 19(1)(d) and 19(1)(e)).\n  - It creates a discriminatory environment against non-residents of Haryana, undermining the unity and integrity of the nation.\n  - The State lacks legislative competence to impose such restrictions, as employment is a matter that falls under the Union List (Entry 81).\n  \n- **State's Arguments:**\n  - The Act is a valid exercise of the State's power to legislate for the welfare of its residents and is justified under Articles 19(5) and 19(6) as a reasonable restriction in the interest of the general public.\n  - The classification based on domicile is permissible and does not violate the Constitution.\n\n**Court's Reasoning:**\n1. **Maintainability of the Petition:** The court held that the petitions are maintainable as they involve fundamental rights violations, despite being filed by associations.\n2. **Legislative Competence:** The court found that the State does not have the authority to legislate on matters of employment in a manner that discriminates based on domicile, as this falls under the Union's jurisdiction.\n3. **Discrimination and Fundamental Rights:** The court emphasized that the Act's provisions create a barrier to free movement and employment opportunities for citizens from other states, violating Articles 14 and 19.\n4. **Reasonable Restrictions:** The court concluded that the restrictions imposed by the Act are not reasonable and do not serve the public interest, as they unjustly limit the rights of individuals to seek employment.\n\n**Decision:**\nThe Punjab and Haryana High Court declared The Haryana State Employment of Local Candidates Act, 2020 unconstitutional and held it to be ultra vires the Constitution of India. The Act is ineffective from the date it came into force, thereby allowing the petitioners' challenge to succeed.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis judgment reinforces the principles of equality and non-discrimination enshrined in the Constitution, emphasizing that legislative measures cannot infringe upon the fundamental rights of citizens, particularly in matters of employment and free movement across the country."}

The petitioner challenged FIR No. 174/2020, which accused her of offenses under Sections 295-A and 505(2) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), registered at Police Station Gandhi Nagar, Jammu. \n\nThe petitioner contended that her tweet, which depicted a woman revered during the Navratras but sexually assaulted at other times, aimed to highlight the issue of rape in India and did not intend to hurt any religious sentiments. Citing the Supreme Court's ruling in Mahendra Singh Dhoni v. Yerraguntla Shyamsundar, (2017) 7 SCC 760, the petitioner argued that Section 295-A IPC applies only to acts intended to outrage religious feelings, asserting that her tweet did not meet this criterion.\n\nIn response, the learned Additional Advocate General (AAG) noted that the petitioner’s tweet had incited protests from a particular group, suggesting that it did indeed hurt community sentiments. The court refrained from delving into the merits of the case at this stage, emphasizing that the investigation was still in its early stages. However, it acknowledged that the petitioner was already granted anticipatory bail by the Principal Sessions Judge, Jammu.\n\nConsequently, the court directed that the investigation could proceed, but the Investigating Agency was prohibited from filing a final report without prior permission from the court.

The bail application was prompted by a significant deterioration in the petitioner’s health, as detailed in an additional affidavit submitted to the court, which included medical records from various hospitals.\n\nThe Additional Solicitor General (ASG), Mr. S.V. Raju, acknowledged receipt and verification of the medical documents, confirming that while the prosecution opposed the bail on merits, they recognized the petitioner’s medical condition warranted consideration. The ASG noted that during the petitioner’s previous bail period, there had been no violations of bail conditions or evidence tampering.\n\nThe petitioner’s medical history indicated serious health issues, including acute low back pain and bilateral lower limb radiculopathy, as documented in medical records from Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital and Central Jail Hospital, Tihar. The petitioner had undergone multiple examinations and treatments, with recommendations for further medical care, including potential surgery.\n\nThe court emphasized the importance of the right to life and dignity, which encompasses the right to adequate medical treatment, particularly for individuals who are sick or infirm. Citing precedents, including the case of Devaki Nandan Garg vs. Directorate of Enforcement, the court noted that Section 45 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) allows for bail under specific conditions for those who are sick or infirm, thereby exempting them from the usual stringent requirements.\n\nUltimately, the court granted bail to the petitioner on the condition of furnishing a personal bond of Rs. 1,00,000 with two sureties, alongside several stipulations to ensure compliance with the legal process. These conditions included surrendering the passport, regular communication with the investigating officer, and refraining from any criminal activity during the bail period. The court clarified that this decision was based solely on the petitioner’s medical condition and should not be construed as a precedent or an indication of the merits of the case.\n\nThe petition and the associated application were disposed of, with instructions for the order to be communicated to the concerned Jail Superintendent for compliance."}

The complaint alleged offenses under Sections 376 (rape), 328 (causing hurt by means of poison), 120B (criminal conspiracy), and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).\n\nThe respondent No. 2 filed her complaint on June 21, 2018, after an Action Taken Report (ATR) from the police indicated that the allegations were unsubstantiated. Despite this, the Metropolitan Magistrate ordered the registration of an FIR, citing the Supreme Court's ruling in Lalita Kumari v. Government of Uttar Pradesh, which mandates FIR registration in cases of cognizable offenses. The petitioner contended that the Magistrate failed to consider the ATR and that the complaint did not meet the requirements of Section 154 Cr.P.C., which necessitates that information about cognizable offenses be reported to the police.\n\nThe Special Judge upheld the Magistrate's decision, emphasizing that the inquiry conducted was preliminary and did not negate the need for an FIR. The petitioner argued that the police investigation disproved the complainant's claims, asserting that he could not have been at the alleged location at the time of the incident, supported by witness statements and CCTV footage.\n\nThe State's counsel maintained that the courts had made concurrent decisions, and the petitioner could not seek a second revision. The respondent's counsel argued that she had previously approached the police, fulfilling the requirements of Section 154(3) Cr.P.C., and that the police's failure to act constituted a miscarriage of justice.\n\nThe High Court reiterated its supervisory powers under Section 482 Cr.P.C. to prevent abuse of process and ensure justice. It concluded that the complaint to the Commissioner of Police, received prior to the filing of the complaint before the Magistrate, satisfied the requirements of Section 154(1) Cr.P.C. The Court found no merit in the petitioner's claims that the FIR registration was unwarranted, affirming that the learned MM's orders were justified and that the police had a duty to register the FIR and conduct a thorough investigation.\n\nUltimately, the High Court dismissed the petition, vacated interim orders, and directed the immediate registration of the FIR, mandating that the investigation be completed and a detailed report submitted within three months."}

Stan Swamy was arrested on October 8, 2020, under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) for allegedly being involved in a conspiracy to incite violence and create communal disharmony. The case originated from a report filed on January 8, 2018, by Mr. Tushar Ramesh Damgude, who claimed that an event organized by Elgar Parishad on December 31, 2017, in Pune featured provocative performances and speeches that incited violence, leading to riots near Bhima-Koregaon.\n\nThe investigation revealed that members of Kabir Kala Manch, associated with the event, were allegedly spreading hatred and inciting violence. Following searches of various suspects' residences, incriminating documents and electronic data were recovered, which the prosecution argued indicated a larger conspiracy involving the Communist Party of India (Maoist) aimed at overthrowing the government through armed revolution.\n\n**Arguments:**\nFr. Swamy contended that he is a Catholic priest and a tribal rights activist, asserting that he was not present at the Elgar Parishad event and had no involvement in the alleged conspiracy. He claimed that the accusations against him were baseless, citing a lack of prima facie evidence and procedural delays in the investigation. He also argued that the documents relied upon by the prosecution were inadmissible and that his involvement in human rights activism should not be criminalized.\n\nThe prosecution, however, maintained that there was substantial evidence linking Swamy to the banned organization, including over 140 emails exchanged with co-accused, documents recovered from his electronic devices, and testimonies indicating his active participation in activities supporting the CPI (Maoist).\n\n**Decision:**\nThe court, after considering the gravity of the charges, the nature of the evidence, and the provisions of Section 43-D(5) of the UAPA, concluded that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the accusations against Fr. Swamy were prima facie true. The court emphasized that the collective interest of society outweighed the applicant's right to personal liberty, particularly given the serious nature of the allegations.\n\n**Ruling:**\nThe bail application filed by Fr. Stan Swamy was rejected, with the court affirming that the evidence presented by the prosecution warranted his continued detention pending trial. The court highlighted the need for a thorough examination of the evidence during the trial phase, noting that the applicant's age and health concerns did not mitigate the severity of the charges against him.\n\n**Final Order:**\nBail Application (Exh.04) in Special Case No.871 of 2020 stands rejected."}
{"ID": "id_8", "Summary": "In the case of W.P.(C) No.24058 of 2022, the petitioners, couples seeking assisted reproductive technology (ART) services, challenge the upper age limits set by the Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Act, 2021, which restricts women to 50 years and men to 55 years. They argue that these age limits, as prescribed under Section 21(g) of the ART Act, are irrational, arbitrary, and infringe upon their fundamental right to reproduction, as recognized by the Supreme Court of India.\n\nThe petitioners, represented by Advocates Akash Sathyanandan and Alex Scaria, contend that prior to the ART Act's enactment, the National Guidelines for ART did not impose an upper age limit, allowing them to pursue treatments without concern for age. The introduction of the ART Act on January 25, 2022, abruptly halted ongoing treatments, causing significant emotional distress among the petitioners. They highlight the absence of a transitional provision in the ART Act, contrasting it with the Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, which includes such provisions.\n\nThe amicus curiae, providing insights into the psychological, ethical, and social implications of restricting access to ART, emphasizes that such limitations could exacerbate frustrations for families unable to conceive naturally. The report suggests that advanced parental age may correlate with stable family environments and better socio-economic conditions, although it acknowledges concerns regarding the physical capacity of older parents.\n\nThe Central Government, represented by Deputy Solicitor General S. Manu, defends the age limits, asserting that the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Health and Family Welfare thoroughly considered relevant factors before establishing the criteria of 21 to 50 years for women and 21 to 55 years for men. The government argues that the legislation is well-founded and does not warrant judicial interference.\n\nThe court, upon reviewing the legislative history and the evolution of the ART Act, notes that while the age limits were established without extensive discussion, the absence of deliberation alone does not render the provision unconstitutional. The court recognizes that reproductive rights are integral to personal liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution, and any restrictions must be reasonable.\n\nUltimately, the court finds the upper age limit to be excessive and arbitrary, particularly for those already undergoing treatment when the ART Act was enacted. It directs that petitioners currently receiving ART services may continue their treatment and instructs the National Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy Board to reassess the age limits and recommend necessary amendments to the Central Government. The court emphasizes the need for a transitional provision in the ART Act and reserves the petitioners' right to approach the court again if necessary."}

The petitioner had applied for a mining lease in 1994 under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, and subsequently under the Mineral Concession Rules, 1960, and the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957. \n\nThe petitioner’s application was recommended by the District Collector and approved by the UOI in 1997, leading to the execution of the mining lease in 1998. However, following a series of public interest litigations regarding the arbitrary allocation of coal blocks from 1993 to 2011, the Supreme Court ruled that many allocations were illegal, including those involving the petitioner, which were listed in the Second Judgment.\n\nThe UOI subsequently filed a contempt petition against the petitioner for failing to pay an additional levy of ₹295 per metric tonne of coal extracted, as mandated by the court's judgments. The petitioner contended that it was not a beneficiary of the flawed allocation process and had followed the correct legal procedures for obtaining its mining lease. \n\nThe court examined the sequence of events and determined that the petitioner had not been allocated coal blocks through the Screening Committee or the Government Dispensation Route, as it had applied directly to the State Government, which independently recommended the lease to the UOI. The court found that the UOI's inclusion of the petitioner in the list of errant mine owners was erroneous and that the petitioner had not been afforded an opportunity to clarify its position before the court.\n\nUltimately, the court ruled in favor of the petitioner, quashing the UOI's demand for the additional levy and dismissing the contempt petition as meritless. The UOI was ordered to pay litigation costs of ₹1,00,000 to the petitioner within four weeks, highlighting the UOI's failure to conduct due diligence and the unjust consequences faced by the petitioner due to the UOI's actions."}

The court, after considering the arguments and the previous order concerning Nupur Sharma, concluded that it was appropriate to transfer all FIRs and complaints against Kumar to the IFSO unit of Delhi Police to ensure a unified investigation. \n\nThe court issued several directives: all FIRs related to the case were to be transferred to the IFSO unit, with specific FIRs treated as lead cases for investigation; the IFSO unit was authorized to gather information from state agencies as needed; no coercive actions would be taken against Kumar for eight weeks to allow her to seek further relief; and any future FIRs related to the same incident would also be transferred to the IFSO unit.\n\nThe court clarified that the petitioner could pursue her primary prayer for quashing the FIRs through the Delhi High Court under Article 226 or Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code, emphasizing that it had not expressed any opinion on the merits of the allegations in the FIRs. The petition was disposed of in accordance with these directives."}

The allegations were primarily focused on the conduct of the trial court and the presiding judges, claiming bias and favoritism towards the accused, which the appellant argued compromised the victim's right to a fair trial.\n\n**Key Allegations:** The appellant's appeal included claims that:\n1. The trial court proceedings were improperly influenced by the presiding judge, who allegedly disregarded the victim's requests for a female judge as mandated by the Supreme Court.\n2. The judge was accused of favoring the accused and conducting proceedings in a manner that undermined the victim's rights, including ignoring objections raised by the victim's counsel.\n3. The appellant contended that the judge's actions were arbitrary and prejudicial, leading to an unjust acquittal of the accused.\n\n**Judicial Findings:** The learned Single Judge, upon reviewing the allegations, determined that the statements made by the appellant were not merely criticisms but constituted contempt of court. The judge emphasized that:\n- The allegations were scandalous and aimed at undermining the dignity of the judiciary.\n- Such statements could potentially disrupt the administration of justice and public confidence in the judicial system.\n- The conduct of the appellant was deemed to be malicious and intended to scandalize the court.\n\n**Contempt Proceedings:** The court issued a notice of contempt against the appellant, leading to a hearing where the appellant maintained that his statements were factual and not contemptuous. However, the court found that:\n- The allegations were baseless and made with the intent to tarnish the reputation of the judges involved.\n- The appellant's refusal to retract or apologize for his statements further solidified the court's position on the contemptuous nature of his remarks.\n\n**Decision:** The court held the appellant guilty of contempt under Section 2(c)(i) of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, stating that the allegations made were not only unfounded but also detrimental to the integrity of the judiciary. Consequently, the appellant was sentenced to:\n- **Simple Imprisonment:** 6 months\n- **Fine:** ₹2,000 (with an additional 7 days of imprisonment in default of payment)\n\n**Additional Orders:** The court allowed the appellant a brief period to attend to personal matters before being taken into custody and directed that he be permitted to bring necessary medications to jail.\n\n**Conclusion:** This case underscores the judiciary's commitment to maintaining its dignity and the principle of fair trial, emphasizing that while criticism of judicial decisions is permissible, it must be grounded in truth and not aimed at scandalizing the court or its officers. The ruling serves as a reminder of the boundaries of acceptable discourse regarding judicial conduct."}

Sangli, along with the charge sheet RCC Case No. 86/2021, which involved allegations under sections 406, 498-A, 504, 506 read with 34 of the Indian Penal Code. The Petitioners were represented by Mr. Umesh Mankapure, while the State was represented by Ms. M.M. Deshmukh, and Mr. Dilip Shinde appeared for Respondent No. 2. The matter was heard finally at the admission stage with consent from all parties.\n\nThe FIR was lodged by Respondent No. 2 following her marriage to Amol Amrit Salunkhe on July 13, 2020. She alleged that she was driven out of her matrimonial home in November 2020 and claimed that her husband had failed to establish a conjugal relationship since their marriage. Additionally, she accused her in-laws, including the Petitioners, of taunting and insulting her, with specific allegations against the Petitioners being that they commented on her cooking skills and her upbringing.\n\nThe Court noted that minor disputes do not amount to cruelty as defined under Section 498-A of the IPC, which requires evidence of willful conduct likely to drive a woman to suicide or cause grave injury, as well as continuous or persistent harassment. Citing the Supreme Court's ruling in Manju Ram Kalita v. State of Assam, the Court emphasized that the allegations against the Petitioners did not meet the threshold for cruelty.\n\nFurthermore, the Court referred to the guidelines established in State of Haryana v. Ch. Bhajan Lal, which outline circumstances under which inherent powers under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code may be exercised, particularly when the allegations do not prima facie constitute an offense or when the proceedings are maliciously instituted.\n\nIn light of the nature of the accusations, the Court concluded that the FIR against the Petitioners was not substantiated and thus decided to quash the FIR and the charge sheet. Consequently, the Petition was allowed, and the FIR No. 0009/2021 and the associated charge sheet RCC Case No. 86/2021 were quashed concerning the Petitioners. The case was disposed of accordingly."}
{"ID": "id_843", "Summary": "In the case of **Anuja Arun Redij v. The State of Maharashtra and Anr**, the petitioner, Anuja Arun Redij, sought to quash a communication from the Regional Forest Officer dated 18th March 2019, which rejected her application for compensation following the death of her husband, Arun Arvind Redij, due to a wild boar attack. The incident occurred on 5th February 2019 when the deceased, returning home from work, encountered a wild boar, leading to a fatal accident. The petitioner applied for compensation based on a Government Resolution (GR) dated 11th July 2018, which stipulates a compensation of Rs. 10 lakhs for deaths caused by wild animal attacks.\n\nDespite the submission of relevant documents, including the FIR and postmortem report, the Regional Forest Officer denied the claim, citing a failure to notify the nearest forest officer within 48 hours and the absence of a panchanama conducted within three days. The petitioner contested this decision, arguing that the police had promptly reported the incident, and the reasons for rejection were unjustified.\n\nThe court, upon reviewing the case, found that the reasons provided by the Regional Forest Officer were not acceptable. It emphasized that the police's obligation to inform the forest department was clear, and the timeline cited by the respondents was irrelevant to the claim. The court noted that the GR clearly entitles victims of wild animal attacks to compensation, reinforcing the state's duty to protect citizens under Article 21 of the Constitution of India.\n\nThe judgment referenced a similar case where compensation was granted despite procedural delays, highlighting the need for a benevolent interpretation of the GR. Ultimately, the court ruled in favor of the petitioner, ordering the state to pay Rs. 10 lakhs in compensation, along with 6% interest from three months post-application, and awarded litigation costs of Rs. 50,000. The communication rejecting the compensation claim was quashed, and the state was directed to comply within three months."}
{"ID": "id_85", "Summary": "In the case of Bombay Lawyers Association v. Jagdeep Dhankar & Ors., the petitioner, a registered body of advocates, sought to disqualify the Vice President of India and the Law Minister from their constitutional posts, alleging that their public statements demonstrated a lack of faith in the Constitution and undermined the authority of the Supreme Court. The petitioner argued that the conduct of the respondents had shaken public confidence in the judiciary and violated their fundamental duties under Article 51-A of the Constitution, which mandates respect for constitutional institutions.\n\nThe petitioner’s counsel, Mr. Ahmad Abdi, contended that the respondents' derogatory remarks about the judiciary and their attacks on the collegium system were unbecoming of their positions, thereby lowering the dignity of the Supreme Court. He cited precedents, including the Calcutta High Court's ruling in Babul Supriyo v. State of West Bengal, emphasizing the expectation of dignified conduct from public representatives, and the Supreme Court's decision in A.I.I.M.S. Students Union v. A.I.I.M.S., which, while noting that fundamental duties are not enforceable, provides guidance for interpreting legal issues.\n\nIn response, the Additional Solicitor General, Mr. Anil Singh, dismissed the petition as frivolous and publicity-seeking, asserting that both respondents had affirmed their commitment to the Constitution and the judiciary. He argued that the Vice President could not be removed through a writ petition under Article 226 and referenced the Supreme Court's ruling in Dattaraj Nathuji Thaware v. State of Maharashtra, which cautions against the admission of PILs that are politically motivated or for publicity.\n\nThe court acknowledged the importance of public interest litigation (PIL) as a tool for protecting public interest but emphasized that it should not be used for publicity or political disputes. The court affirmed the credibility of the Supreme Court, stating that it cannot be diminished by individual statements, and reiterated that all citizens, including those in constitutional positions, must respect the Constitution.\n\nUltimately, the court concluded that the petition did not warrant intervention under Article 226, finding no basis to disqualify the respondents from their constitutional roles. The petition was dismissed, reinforcing the principle that fair criticism of judicial decisions is permissible while maintaining the majesty of the law."}

The petitioners highlighted a grave situation where Anis Khan, known for his outspoken criticism of educational institutions demanding donations and the poor conditions of hospitals in Uluberia, was reportedly killed following an interrogation by police personnel.\n\nOn February 19, 2022, it was alleged that Civic Volunteers, acting under the influence of the Bagnan Police, visited Khan's residence. They initially interacted with his father before proceeding to the third floor, where Khan was brutally assaulted and subsequently murdered, with his body being disposed of from the higher floor. The petitioners expressed concerns that the authorities attempted to mitigate public outrage by offering a job to Khan's brother, while also fearing that the investigation might be compromised due to the involvement of individuals associated with the ruling party.\n\nThe court ordered that a list of dates and a notarized affidavit dated February 21, 2022, be served to Amitesh Banerjee, the Senior Standing Counsel for the State, and instructed that any additional relevant facts be communicated to him.

{"ID": "id_870", "Summary": "In the case of W.P.(C) No. 2454 of 2020, the petitioners, Xenia Dhar, Palak Sharma, Gaurav Mitra, Vishal Raj Singh, and Aditya Raj, challenged a notice issued by the National Law School of India University (NLSIU), Bengaluru, which announced a separate examination for admission to its Five Years B.A. LL.B. (Hons) degree program scheduled for 12.09.2020. The petitioners argued that this action was illegal and arbitrary, violating the Bye Laws of the Consortium of National Law Universities (NLUs) and infringing upon their right to a fair examination process.\n\nThe background of the case highlights the establishment of NLSIU in 1987 as the first National Law University, leading to the formation of 23 NLUs across India aimed at enhancing legal education standards. A Public Interest Litigation (PIL) in 2006 prompted the introduction of the Common Law Admission Test (CLAT), which was first conducted in 2008. The CLAT consortium was formalized in 2019, with NLSIU as a founding member. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the CLAT 2020 examination was postponed multiple times, with the latest date set for 28.09.2020.\n\nThe petitioners contended that NLSIU's decision to conduct a separate examination violated the principles of promissory estoppel and was made without adequate notice, undermining the integrity of the admission process. They also claimed that the notice was issued shortly before the examination date, which was arbitrary and whimsical.\n\nIn response, NLSIU's counsel argued that the university faced unique challenges due to its trimester system, necessitating a separate examination to avoid a zero academic year. They emphasized that the decision was made after thorough consideration by the university's faculty and aimed to facilitate a fair and accessible examination process for students.\n\nThe court, after hearing the arguments, noted that the petitioners were primarily contesting the internal regulations of the CLAT consortium, which is based in Bengaluru, indicating that the dispute was inter se among the NLUs. The court highlighted the principle of forum non-convenience, suggesting that it would be inappropriate to adjudicate matters with potential nationwide implications, especially when similar issues were pending in the Supreme Court and other jurisdictions.\n\nUltimately, the court concluded that the petitioners did not present sufficient grounds to invoke its extraordinary writ jurisdiction, given the broader ramifications of the case and the ongoing legal proceedings in other courts. Therefore, the court declined to interfere with the notice issued by NLSIU, allowing the separate examination to proceed as planned."}

Central Bureau of Investigation**\n\n**Case Overview:**\nThe case involves Christian James Michel, a British citizen, who filed an application for release from custody, having been extradited from Dubai on December 4, 2018. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) registered a First Information Report (FIR) against him and 17 others on March 12, 2013, for offenses under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. The substantive charges against Michel primarily relate to Sections 8, 9, and 12 of the Prevention of Corruption Act.\n\n**Key Facts:**\n1. Michel was extradited to India after expressing willingness to cooperate with the investigation but was detained during extradition proceedings in Dubai.\n2. The applicant contended that he had already served more than five years in custody, exceeding the maximum sentence for the alleged offenses prior to amendments made in 2014.\n3. The applicant invoked the Doctrine of Specialty, arguing that he could only be tried for the offenses specified in the extradition decree, which did not include certain charges brought against him.\n\n**Arguments Presented:**\n- **For the Applicant:**\n  - Michel argued that the charges under Sections 415 and 420 IPC were not substantiated in the charge sheets filed by the CBI.\n  - He claimed that the absence of specific allegations under the relevant sections of the IPC and the Prevention of Corruption Act warranted his release, as he had already served the maximum sentence.\n  - The applicant also cited a judgment from the Italian court that exonerated him, asserting that double jeopardy principles should apply.\n\n- **For the CBI:**\n  - The CBI countered that the application lacked merit and was an attempt to mislead the court, emphasizing that the applicant had not disclosed previous court orders relevant to the case.\n  - They argued that the extradition decree included charges of conspiracy and fraud, which justified the ongoing prosecution.\n  - The CBI maintained that the applicant's detention was lawful and that the charges under Section 467 IPC, which carries a potential life sentence, were valid.\n\n**Court's Reasoning:**\nThe court noted that the applicant's arguments regarding the Doctrine of Specialty had been previously adjudicated by higher courts, which found no merit in his claims. The court emphasized that the extradition treaty with the UAE allowed for prosecution of connected offenses, and the applicant could not evade trial for serious charges, including those under Section 467 IPC. The court also highlighted that the applicant's detention was in accordance with legal procedures and that the findings of the UN Human Rights Council were not binding on Indian courts.\n\n**Decision:**\nThe application for release filed by Christian James Michel was dismissed by the court, which found no merit in the claims made by the applicant. The court reiterated that nothing in the order would affect the merits of the ongoing case.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe case underscores the complexities of extradition law, the application of the Doctrine of Specialty, and the legal standards for determining the validity of charges in the context of international treaties. The court's ruling reflects a commitment to uphold procedural integrity while addressing serious allegations of corruption and fraud."}

No. 660/2021 for serious offences under various sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Arms Act. The petitioner’s counsel asserts that he was a minor at the time of the alleged offences, supported by documents including a School Bonafide Certificate and an Aadhar Card confirming his date of birth as June 4, 2005. However, the police officer, respondent No. 3, PI Samadhan Wagh, allegedly demanded a bribe of Rs. 50,000 from the petitioner’s father and failed to present the documents proving the petitioner’s juvenility to the Juvenile Justice Board.\n\nThe Juvenile Justice Board, upon the police's request, ordered a medical examination to determine the petitioner’s age, which concluded he was approximately 20-21 years old. This led to the petitioner being treated as an adult in subsequent court proceedings. The petitioner’s counsel contends that the Board did not follow the mandated procedures for age determination as outlined in Section 94 of the Juvenile Justice Act, which requires that age be established through documents before resorting to medical tests.\n\nThe court found merit in the petitioner’s claims, noting the lack of compliance with the statutory provisions and the failure to consider the submitted documents that indicated the petitioner’s juvenility. Consequently, the court quashed the orders of the Juvenile Justice Board and directed that the investigation be reassigned to Senior Inspector Jeevan Kharat, who must present the relevant documents to the Board within a week. The court also ordered the immediate transfer of the petitioner to a Children Observation Home until further orders are issued.\n\nAdditionally, the court instructed the Additional Commissioner of Police to investigate the allegations against PI Samadhan Wagh and to hear the petitioner regarding his grievances.

The FIR stemmed from allegations made by the informant, Pratik Kothari, who claimed that the petitioners had engaged in fraudulent activities related to the sale of flats in a construction project named 'Breathe' in Kolkata.\n\nThe petitioners initially approached the Supreme Court under Article 32 of the Constitution, which allowed them to withdraw their petition with the liberty to approach the High Court. Following this, they filed the present writ petition in the High Court, seeking to quash the FIR and related proceedings, asserting that they were falsely implicated and that the police acted in collusion with the informant.\n\nThe petitioners contended that the FIR was based on a slow construction pace and dishonored cheques, which they argued were issued under duress. They claimed that the police had coerced them into signing agreements and handing over cheques, violating their rights to life, liberty, and dignity. The petitioners also highlighted procedural violations, including the lack of notice under Section 41-A of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.).\n\nThe High Court noted the petitioners' allegations of police misconduct and the historical context of similar complaints against the Dhanbad Police. It acknowledged the need for judicial intervention given the prima facie evidence of police high-handedness. The court issued notices to the respondents and directed the preservation of CCTV footage from the Bankmore Police Station, which was allegedly relevant to the case.\n\nThe court emphasized that the FIR disclosed sufficient grounds for investigation, rejecting the petitioners' claims of innocence at this stage. It highlighted the importance of allowing the investigation to proceed, as the allegations involved disputed facts that could not be resolved without a trial. The court dismissed the writ petition, vacating any interim protection previously granted to the petitioners, and mandated the Jharkhand Police to ensure proper installation and maintenance of CCTV cameras in police stations, in compliance with Supreme Court directives.\n\nIn conclusion, the High Court determined that the petitioners had not made a case for quashing the FIR, allowing the criminal proceedings to continue while directing the police to adhere to procedural safeguards regarding the treatment of individuals in custody.

The incident, as detailed in the FIR, involved the accused allegedly pelting stones at police vehicles and setting them on fire following Friday prayers, resulting in injuries to police personnel and significant disruption of law and order.\n\nThe applicant's counsel argued that the allegations against him were unfounded and based on general accusations rather than specific actions. It was contended that the applicant did not participate in the violence, nor did he instigate the mob, which reportedly included over 200 individuals. The defense highlighted that the applicant, a social worker, was falsely implicated due to his activism against local injustices. Furthermore, it was noted that other co-accused, similarly situated, had been granted bail, establishing a precedent for the applicant's release.\n\nIn contrast, the prosecution opposed the bail application, asserting that the applicant played a significant role in inciting the mob and that his actions were detrimental to national integration. They emphasized the severity of the incident, which involved injuries to police personnel and damage to public property, arguing that the applicant's prior criminal history and the nature of the accusations warranted the denial of bail.\n\nThe court, after reviewing the arguments and evidence, noted that while the applicant was named in the FIR, the allegations were largely general and did not substantiate claims of direct involvement in the violence. The court acknowledged that the applicant had been in custody since June 10, 2022, and that many similarly accused individuals had already been granted bail. It concluded that the applicant's involvement appeared limited to organizing a gathering rather than instigating violence.\n\nUltimately, the court allowed the bail application, stipulating that the applicant be released on bail upon furnishing a personal bond and two sureties, with conditions to ensure his appearance in court and to prevent any interference with the case. The decision underscored the principle that bail is the norm and incarceration the exception, particularly when the evidence does not convincingly establish the applicant's culpability in the alleged mob violence."}

The petition requests a writ of mandamus to allow the medical termination of pregnancy (MTP) in the interest of justice, along with any other relief deemed appropriate by the court.\n\nThe petitioner’s counsel presented that an FIR (No. 894/2023) had been registered against the accused, Kapil Lodhi, under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (POCSO), and the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. The petitioner, aged 17, alleged that she was raped by the accused, which resulted in her pregnancy. The petitioner’s mother worked as a maid in the accused's household, where the accused developed a relationship with the minor under the pretext of marriage.\n\nThe court considered the submissions and previously directed a medical examination of the petitioner by a team of specialists, which confirmed that the termination of pregnancy was medically feasible. The court noted that the petitioner is a minor, and her consent is not relevant in this context due to her age. The court emphasized the psychological and social implications of the pregnancy on the minor, particularly the stigma associated with giving birth to a child conceived through rape.\n\nThe court referenced the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, particularly Sections 3 and 5, which outline the conditions under which a pregnancy may be terminated, including provisions for minors. The court highlighted that the anguish caused by a pregnancy resulting from rape is presumed to constitute a grave injury to the mental health of the pregnant woman.\n\nCiting precedents, including the Supreme Court's ruling in *Murugan Nayakkar Vs. Union of India*, the court underscored the importance of considering the minor's trauma and the potential risks to her health. The court ruled in favor of the petitioner, allowing the termination of her pregnancy and directing the Chief Medical and Health Officer of District Sagar to facilitate the procedure by January 5, 2024, ensuring the presence of qualified medical personnel during the process.\n\nAdditionally, the court mandated that the fetus be preserved for DNA testing, and the petitioner’s father must submit an affidavit confirming the circumstances of the case. The trial court was instructed to report any changes in the prosecutrix's testimony, particularly if she were to recant her allegations.\n\nIn conclusion, the writ petition was allowed, granting the petitioner permission to undergo a medical termination of pregnancy, with the court ensuring that all necessary precautions and legal requirements are met to protect the minor's health and rights."}

The petitioner sought directions for a fair and impartial investigation into FIR No. 409, registered on December 24, 2021, at Police Station Mundkati, which initially charged under Section 365 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and later included Sections 302 and 201 IPC after the discovery of Rizwan's decomposed body on December 30, 2021.\n\nThe petitioner alleged that his son was murdered as part of a criminal conspiracy linked to a previous FIR in which he was falsely implicated. During the investigation, names of several suspects were disclosed, but the investigating officer reportedly failed to act on this information, allegedly due to bribery. Despite the formation of a Special Investigation Team (SIT) and various status reports indicating ongoing investigations, no conclusive evidence was found against the suspects, and the cause of death remained undetermined due to pending histopathological reports.\n\nThe court noted that the investigation had reached a dead end, with no incriminating evidence against the suspects and no CCTV footage or eyewitness accounts available. The petitioner argued for the transfer of the investigation to an independent agency, such as the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), due to the lack of progress and credibility in the state investigation.\n\nCiting precedents from the Supreme Court, the High Court emphasized that the power to transfer investigations should be exercised sparingly and only in exceptional circumstances, particularly when public confidence in the investigation is at stake. Given the circumstances of the case, including the brutal nature of the crime and the failure of the SIT to identify the culprits, the court concluded that transferring the investigation to the CBI was necessary to ensure a credible and thorough inquiry.\n\nConsequently, the court ordered the investigation to be handed over to the CBI, directing the Superintendent of Police, Palwal, to ensure the complete case record was transferred within two weeks. The petition was disposed of with the directive for the CBI to conduct a free and impartial investigation in accordance with the law."}

The respondents provided evidence of prior inspections and demolitions of unauthorized structures, asserting that the appellants had continued unauthorized construction despite these actions.\n\nThe City Civil Judge dismissed the appellants' motion, concluding that they had not established a prima facie case for the relief sought. The court noted that the appellants had failed to comply with the notice and had not applied for retention of the unauthorized work as required under the M.R.T.P Act. The respondents argued that the suit was premature and barred under Section 149 of the M.R.T.P Act, which states that orders issued under the Act cannot be questioned in court.\n\nThe appellants' counsel argued that the notice was arbitrary and did not comply with statutory requirements, specifically that it failed to provide the requisite notice period. However, the respondents' counsel emphasized the appellants' history of violations and the need for strict enforcement of planning regulations to ensure public safety and compliance with the law.\n\nUltimately, the court upheld the dismissal of the appeal, affirming the validity of the respondents' actions and the legality of the notice issued under the M.R.T.P Act. The court concluded that the appellants had not demonstrated entitlement to equitable relief, given their ongoing violations and the lack of clean hands in their approach to the court. The appeal was dismissed without costs, and any pending applications were also disposed of."}

{"ID": "id_978", "Summary": "**Legal Summary of Bhagwani v. The State of Madhya Pradesh (Criminal Appeal Nos. 101-102 of 2022)**\n\nIn the case of Bhagwani versus The State of Madhya Pradesh, the appellant Bhagwani challenged the High Court's affirmation of his conviction and death sentence imposed by the Trial Court under multiple sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO Act). The charges included kidnapping, gang rape, murder, and destruction of evidence, stemming from the brutal assault and death of an 11-year-old girl on April 14, 2017.\n\nThe incident occurred during a naming ceremony at Anil Maravi's residence, where the victim was last seen. After the family realized the girl was missing, her body was discovered the following morning, showing signs of severe trauma and sexual assault. The post-mortem revealed asphyxia and neurogenic shock as causes of death, alongside evidence of rape.\n\nThe investigation led to the arrest of Bhagwani and his accomplice Satish, with circumstantial evidence linking them to the crime. Witness testimonies indicated their presence at the event and subsequent suspicious behavior. The prosecution presented forensic evidence, including DNA analysis, which corroborated the involvement of both accused in the heinous acts.\n\nDuring the trial, the defense argued the lack of direct evidence against Bhagwani, claiming procedural errors and inadequate legal representation. However, the Trial Court found the circumstantial evidence compelling, leading to a conviction and death sentence for both accused.\n\nThe High Court upheld the conviction, prompting Bhagwani to appeal to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court, while recognizing the gravity of the offenses, noted significant concerns regarding the fairness of the trial, particularly the lack of adequate opportunity for the defense to present mitigating circumstances during sentencing. The Court emphasized the necessity of considering the potential for rehabilitation and reformation of the accused, especially given his young age and absence of prior criminal history.\n\nUltimately, the Supreme Court upheld the conviction but commuted the death sentence to life imprisonment for 30 years without remission, reflecting the brutal nature of the crime while acknowledging the need for a fair trial process. The Court's decision underscored the balance between justice for the victim and the rights of the accused under the Indian Constitution.\n\n**Key Elements:**\n- **Parties:** Bhagwani (Appellant) vs. The State of Madhya Pradesh (Respondent)\n- **Charges:** IPC Sections 363, 366A, 364, 346, 376D, 376A, 302, 201; POCSO Act Sections 5(g)(m) and 6\n- **Facts:** Victim's abduction, sexual assault, and murder; circumstantial evidence leading to conviction\n- **Arguments:** Defense claimed lack of direct evidence and procedural errors; prosecution emphasized strong circumstantial and forensic evidence\n- **Decision:** Conviction upheld; death sentence commuted to life imprisonment for 30 years without remission."}
{"ID": "id_99", "Summary": "In the case before the Delhi High Court, the plaintiffs, represented by Mr. Dushyant K. Mahant, Mr. Subhash Bhutoria, and Ms. Aashima Kapoor, initiated proceedings against multiple defendants, including MANAT DHABA and others, under I.A. 24016/2023, invoking Order XXXIX Rules 1 and 2 of the Civil Procedure Code (CPC). On December 4, 2023, the Court issued a notice regarding the application and appointed a Local Commissioner (LC) to investigate the matter, with the LC's report submitted on December 22, 2023.\n\nThe LC's findings revealed that Mr. Randeep Thakur, the owner of defendant No.1 (MANAT DHABA), was uncooperative and denied any acknowledgment of the plaintiffs' trademark MANNAT, despite the plaintiffs asserting that their trademarks have been registered since 2008 and are well-known in the industry. In contrast, Mr. Narender Malik, representing defendant No.2 (New MANNAT DHABA), acknowledged receipt of the suit documents and indicated plans to rebrand the establishment as \"MAHADEV DHABA,\" with an affidavit to be filed confirming this change and an undertaking not to use the plaintiffs' trademarks.\n\nDefendant No.3 (SHRI MANNAT DHABA), represented by Mr. Sarvdeep Saini, had rebranded from \"DELIGHT AMBROSIA\" to \"MANMEET DHABA\" to compete with nearby establishments, while defendant No.4 (APNA MANNAT DHABA) was found to have retained the MANNAT branding due to its popularity, despite the owner, Mr. Nitin Yadav, being unrepresented in court.\n\nThe Court, after considering the LC's report and the plaintiffs' claims, determined that a prima facie case for an ad-interim injunction was established against defendants No.1, 3, and 4, thereby restraining them from using any branding similar to the plaintiffs' registered trademarks. The Court ordered that the defendants could approach the plaintiffs for potential settlement regarding rebranding. The matter is scheduled for further proceedings on February 5, 2024, to complete service and pleadings, with compliance under Order XXXIX Rule 3 of the CPC required within one week. The order will also be made available on the Court's website."}
{"ID": "id_991", "Summary": "In the case of MFA No. 8998 of 2017, the appellant, referred to as the husband, challenged the dismissal of his petition for divorce under Section 13(i)(a) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, by the II Additional Principal Judge, Family Court, Bengaluru. The marriage between the parties was solemnized on November 15, 2007, and the husband alleged that the wife subjected him to humiliation regarding his appearance, leading to mental distress. He claimed that the wife filed a false complaint against him and his family under Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code, which resulted in harassment and legal troubles for him.\n\nThe husband further asserted that the wife had left their matrimonial home and was living with her parents, refusing to reconcile. He described her behavior as cruel, stating that she had made unfounded allegations against him, including claims of an illicit relationship, which he argued constituted mental cruelty. The wife contested these claims, admitting to the marriage and their daughter but denying the allegations of cruelty, asserting that the husband was abusive and demanding dowry.\n\nThe Family Court, after examining the evidence, dismissed the husband's petition, concluding that he had not established a case for cruelty as defined by legal standards. The court referenced the Supreme Court's ruling in Naveen Kohli vs. Neelu Kohli, emphasizing that the conduct complained of must be severe enough to be intolerable.\n\nOn appeal, the husband’s counsel argued that the Family Court failed to appreciate the evidence of cruelty and the impact of the wife's allegations on the husband's mental well-being. The court acknowledged that mental cruelty could arise from false accusations and noted that the wife’s complaints had indeed caused significant distress to the husband.\n\nUpon reviewing the evidence, the appellate court found that the wife's allegations were baseless and had not been substantiated, which could reasonably be expected to cause mental anguish. The court also noted that the wife had not shown willingness to reconcile, further supporting the husband's claims of cruelty.\n\nConsequently, the appellate court set aside the Family Court's judgment, allowing the husband's petition for divorce and dissolving the marriage. The court did not address issues of alimony or maintenance, stating that any future petitions regarding these matters would be considered on their own merits. The final ruling dissolved the marriage solemnized on November 15, 2007, between the parties."}
