{"ID": "id_10", "Summary": "The Allahabad High Court on Thursday stayed the Lucknow Development Authority (LDA)’s decision to carry out large scale demolitions in Akbar Nagar-I and II areas and directed LDA to first initiate the resettlement process for those going to be affected [Syed Hamidul Bari v. State of UP]. \nJustice Pankaj Bhatia questioned the “tearing hurry” being shown to demolish the properties of persons belonging to disadvantaged sections without implementation of the scheme for their rehabilitation. \n“At this stage, it is not clear as to what is the tearing hurry in which huge occupations by the relatively poor class of persons are being proposed to be demolished forthwith without even waiting for the scheme of relocating the adversely affected persons being implemented in letter and spirit and also exposing the poorest of the poor to the ensuing harsh winters,” asked the Court.\nConsidering that fundamental rights including the right to livelihood would prima-facie be affected due to the actions of LDA and that State has a bounden duty to ensure Article is not violated, the Court ordered that no demolition shall be carried out in the entire area.\nIt further ordered the LDA to give reasonable time of four weeks to the inhabitants to apply in terms of the scheme for their rehabilitation.\n“The Lucknow Development Authority shall thereafter take steps for resettlement of the persons who have applied in terms of the scheme forthwith and obtain vacant physical possession of the present premises in their occupation,” the Court directed.\nThe Court opined that though the petitioners have not been able to demonstrate any prima-facie title in their favour, they have “successfully established their possession, even if the said possession is an illegal possession.”\nThe High Court passed the order in a batch of petitions challenging the demolition orders passed by the LDA. The appeals filed under UP Urban Planning and Development Act against the demolition orders had earlier been dismissed by the appellate authority.\nThe matter was taken up on a mentioning by Senior Advocate JN Mathur today. It was argued that appellate authority had dismissed the challenge on the basis of materials which were never provided to the petitioners, who were facing the demolition.\nIt was also submitted that the petitioners have been in occupation of the premises prior to enactment of Urban Planning and Development Act, 1973, and thus the proceedings under it could not have been initiated against them.\nHowever, the counsel representing the LDA challenged the submission and also contended that petitioners had failed to establish any title over the property in question. \nIt was also argued that the properties are located over a river belt and the petitioners cannot claim any right of adverse possession.\nConsidering the submissions, the Court noted that though the petitioners have been in occupation of the land without any title in their favour, government roads have been constructed in the area and other municipal services are being provided to them with the passage of time.\nIt also found that some were also paying the municipal taxes and a school was being run in the vicinity. On the issue of whether the petitioners have been in occupation of the properties prior to the 1973 Act, the Court said it can be considered subsequently.\nThe Court also noted that appeals were dismissed on December 16 and execution was happening within five days of the passing of those orders. \n“It is also an admitted fact that the Lucknow Development Authority has initiated the process of relocating the various persons in terms of their scheme as recorded hereinabove and in fact, a camp has been set up wherein around 70 to 80 people have enrolled and registered themselves for being relocated at other places, in terms of the scheme,” the Court recorded.\nIt sought the responses of the State government and LDA and listed the matter for further directions and decision on January 22, 2024. \nSenior Advocate JN Mathur with advocates Kazim Ibrahim, Amit Khare, Amrendra Nath Tripathi, Akshay Kumar Singh and Aishvarya Mathur represented the petitioners.\nAdvocates Ratnesh Chandra with Sri Sankalp Mishra represented the Lucknow Development Authority.\nChief Standing Counsel Shailendra Kumar Singh with Additional Chief Standing Counsel Pankaj Srivastava represented the State."}

It would be against public interest,\" the bench explained.\nOrdinarily, an accused in such offences is entitled to the relief of pre-arrest bail, but the same would not apply here, the Bench made it clear.\n\"The same standard would not be applicable when the accused is the Investigating Officer, a police officer charged with the fiduciary duty of carrying forward the investigation to its rightful conclusion so as to punish the guilty. The respondent is alleged to have failed in this fundamental duty as a police officer...Presumptions and other considerations applicable to a layperson facing criminal charges may not carry the same weight while dealing with a police officer who is alleged to have abused his office.\"\nThe Court made the observations while disposing of an appeal against a High Court order that had granted pre-arrest bail to the police officer who was booked for the offences of impersonation and forgery. The officer had allegedly changed the name of the father of one Ranjeet Kumar Saw from Lakhan Saw to Balgovind Saw and subsequently arrested Ranjeet Kumar Saw, son of Balgovind Saw, so as to shield Ranjeet Kumar Saw, son of Lakhan Saw.\nA trial court had earlier rejected his anticipatory bail plea. The allegation was that he had changed the name of the accused in the first information report (FIR) lodged in a case.\nThe top court at the outset observed that in bail cases, circumstances peculiar to the accused and the larger interest of the public/state also have to be considered.\n\"Considering the position held by the respondent, even if he was suspended from service and the chargesheet had already been filed against him, the possibility of his tampering with the witnesses and the evidence was sufficiently high\", the Bench underscored.\nThe appeal was eventually allowed.

{"ID": "id_1002", "Summary": "The Chhattisgarh High Court recently observed that if a husband indulges in excessive drinking of alcohol instead of discharging his duties, it would amount to mental cruelty to his wife and family, including his children [Payal Sharma vs Umesh Sharma].\nJustices Goutam Bhaduri and Sanjay Agrawal made the observation while allowing the wife's plea for the dissolution of her marriage on grounds of cruelty. \nThe bench noted that the husband, in this case, did not even pay the school fees for his two children, even though his wife was not employed.\n\"It is very natural that the wife would depend upon the husband for her household need and to upbring her children to give a good education and life. If the husband instead of discharging of his obligation indulges himself in excessive drinking habit, which deteriorates the family condition, it would naturally lead to a mental cruelty to the wife and the entire family including children,\" the bench held. \nThe Court observed that many of the allegations of cruelty by the husband arose because of his allegedly excessive drinking habits. \nThe Court was told that after consuming liquor and while in an intoxicated state, the husband used to abuse and assault his wife. It was further submitted that the condition got aggravated to the point where he even sold household goods to buy alcohol. \nThe bench further noted that while the couple had two children, the husband never paid their school fees. When the wife asked for money to pay these fees or for other household goods, he is alleged to have abused and assaulted her.\nSince the husband did not cross-examine the wife on these allegations during family court proceedings, the High Court deemed that these allegations were accepted. \nThe Court remarked that it could, therefore, be safely stated that the husband was mentally cruel to his wife. \n\"The conduct of the wife would show that she tried to save the marriage as otherwise in the earlier occasion the application seeking divorce on the similar ground of excessive drinking would not have been withdrawn on the promise of the husband that he would mend his behaviour,\" the bench further opined.\nWith these observations, the bench dissolved the February 2, 2006 marriage between the couple. The Court also ordered the husband to pay ₹15,000 per month to the wife as maintenance. \nAdvocate Barun Kumar Chakrabarty appeared for the wife. None represented the husband."}

The speech which was delivered at a party event had sparked such a controversy that the MLA soon resigned.\nThe petitioner contended that by publicly insulting the Constitution, Cherian violated Articles 173(a) and 188 of the Constitution of India which set out the qualifications and oath sworn by MLAs.\nOn the other hand, Advocate General (AG) K Gopalakrishna Kurup, submitted that as per Articles 191 and 192 of the Constitution, there are certain parameters and procedures to be followed to disqualify a member of the State Legislative Assembly or Legislative Council.\nReferring to a full bench decision of the Court in KC Chandy v R Balakrishna Pillai, the AG argued that even if there was a breach of oath by a Minister, it would not call for disqualification as an MLA and that the reliefs sought for in the instant writ petition cannot be granted under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.\nAs it had done previously, the bench opined that the provisions of Article 173(a) which deals with qualifications for MLAs are not applicable since Cherian has already been elected as a member of the State Legislature. \n\"Whether the 1st respondent (Cherian) has violated the Oath of office, on the basis of the subject matter, is a matter which could be identified or deciphered only by a fact finding body, taking into account the attendant circumstances.

{"ID": "id_1012", "Summary": "The Kerala High Court recently observed that while verifying a service candidate's character and antecedents, the government cannot disqualify a person from entering government service only because a criminal case was registered against him.[State of Kerala & Ors. v Durgadas & Ors.].\nThe government cannot merely restate allegations made by the prosecution in a criminal case to hold that a service candidate is \"bad\" or \"unsuitable for the post\", the Court held.\nA bench of Justices A Muhamed Mustaque and Shoba Annamma Eapen also clarified that an acquittal in a criminal case does not automatically entitle a candidate to join service.\nThe government should conduct its own inquiry into the allegations in the criminal case, particularly if it cannot form an opinion on the candidate's character on the basis of the prosecution's allegations or the ultimate outcome (such as acquittal) in the case, the Court said.\n“We make it clear that in criminal cases where the prosecution cases end up in acquittal, if the Government cannot form an opinion based on the prosecution allegations and other materials including the finding entered by the criminal court as to the character of the person, the Government is bound to conduct separate enquiry as to the character antecedents of the person. Thus, mere registration of the criminal case will not enable the Government to disqualify such a person from becoming a member of service,\" stated the September 29 judgment. \nThe Court made the observation while dismissing an petition filed by the State government challenging an Kerala Administrative Tribunal (KAT) order in favour a man who sought to join the India Reserve Battalion Commando Wing as a police constable.\nThe KAT had allowed his appointment to Commando Wing following his acquittal in a criminal case filed by his estranged wife. He had approached the KAT after he was not allowed to join the service by citing his criminal antecedents.\nThe KAT ruled in his favour on noting that even though there was a criminal case registered against him, he was acquitted in the matter. This led the State Government to approach the High Court on with a petition challenging the KAT order.\nThe High Court agreed with the KAT decision, observing that since the police constable was acquitted in the case, he could be denied the post merely based on the prosecution's allegations. \nThere is no bar under the Kerala Police Act to temporarily appoint a person even if there are criminal cases pending against him, the Court further noted, although such appointments may be subject to the outcome of the case.\nThe High Court also noted that all the witnesses in the criminal case filed against the constable, including the complainant (his wife), had turned hostile. \n\"Except the allegation of the prosecution, absolutely no materials were available to hold against the candidate It is not safe to assess the character based on the prosecution allegations alone ... The Government could not have concluded that the character is bad to disqualify him from becoming a member of the service without any materials, merely based on prosecution allegations,\" the Court added. \nThe State's petition was, thus, dismissed by the High Court. \nThe State authorities were represented by Additional Advocate General and Public Prosecutor Asok M Cherian and Government Pleader TS Shyam Prasanth.\nThe police constable was represented by advocates Kaleeswaram Raj, Thulasi K Raj and Varun C Vijay."}

[Directorate of Enforcement vs Roop Bansal and Ors]\nA bench of Justices AS Bopanna and PV Sanjay Kumar emphasised that the focus of the bail matter was solely on the legality of the arrest and remand and not the merits of the allegations.\nReferring to the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) and judgments in the money laundering case against Tamil Nadu minister, A Senthil Balaji, the Court underscored that a mere order of remand is not enough to validate the grounds of arrest.\n\"Though much was stated and argued by both sides on the merits of the matter in terms of the involvement of the appellants in the alleged offence of money laundering, we make it clear that we are not concerned with that issue at this point. The only issue for consideration presently is whether the arrest of the appellants under Section 19 of the Act of 2002 was valid and lawful and whether the impugned orders of remand passed by the learned Vacation Judge/Additional Sessions Judge, Panchkula, measure up,\" the Court said.\nFurther, the Court emphasized that Section 167 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) must be necessarily complied with. The ED's actions in curbing money laundering should be fair, stringent and not vindictive, the Court added. \n\"Being a premier investigating agency, charged with the onerous responsibility of curbing the debilitating economic offence of money laundering in our country, every action of the ED in the course of such exercise is expected to be transparent, above board and conforming to pristine standards of fair play in action. The ED, mantled with far-reaching powers under the stringent Act of 2002, is not expected to be vindictive in its conduct and must be seen to be acting with utmost probity and with the highest degree of dispassion and fairness.\"\nThe Court found fault with the ED for its failure to discharge its functions in accordance with these parameters and noted that there appeared to be no consistent and uniform practice followed by the ED in furnishing grounds for arrest.\n\"The clandestine conduct of the ED in proceeding against the appellants, by recording the second ECIR immediately after they secured interim protection in relation to the first ECIR, does not commend acceptance as it reeks of arbitrary exercise of power\".\nAccordingly, the Court allowed the appeals by the Bansal brothers and set aside the arrest and remand order against them.\nThe top court was hearing an appeal challenging an order of the Punjab and Haryana High Court that had refused to quash the Bansal brothers' arrest and remand by the ED.\nThe Bansal brothers were arrested by the Haryana Police’s Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) in connection with a first information report (FIR) registered earlier this year against former Special Judge CBI/ED, Sudhir Parmar.\nThe ED claimed that it had received information that Parmar was showing favouritism to the accused in a money laundering case concerning real estate firm, IREO.\nAfter the ACB registered the case, the Punjab and Haryana High Court also suspended judge Parmar.\nOn a related note, in June this year, Supreme Court judge, Justice KV Viswanathan recused from hearing another plea by the Bansal brothers challenging their arrest and an order giving the ED custody over them. \nSenior Advocates Mukul Rohatgi, Abhishek Manu Singhvi, Randeep Rai, and Vikram Chaudhary with advocates Malak Manish Bhatt, Neeha Nagpal and Rajat Joneja appeared for the Bansals before the apex court.\nAdditional Solicitor General SV Raju appeared for the ED."}

{"ID": "id_1017", "Summary": "A Special Court in Delhi recently acquitted AES Chhattisgarh Energy Private Limited and its founding Director Sanjeev Kumar Aggarwal in a case involving allegations of cheating and criminal conspiracy related to the allocation of the Sayang coal block in Chhattisgarh in 2007 [CBI v. AES Chhattisgarh Energy Private Limited & Anr].\nSpecial Judge Arun Bhardwaj of Rouse Avenue District Courts quashed the case filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), in which it was alleged that the company had misrepresented that it was a 100 percent subsidiary of AES Corporation, USA when it applied for the coal block.  \nThe Court concluded that the accused had not cheated the Ministry of Coal for the allocation of the coal block in their favour as there was no misrepresentation when AES Chhattisgarh Energy referred to its subsidiary nature in the application.\n“Both the accused are therefore acquitted of all the charges framed against them i.e., under section 420 of IPC and under section 120 B IPC and 120 B IPC read with 420 IPC,” the Special Judge said.\nOn examination of the material on record, the Court found that AES Corporation, USA through its subsidiary AES India Private Limited was controlling the composition of the board of directors of AES Chhattisgarh Energy Private Limited.  \nThe Court considered the CBI’s evidence that the accused company itself had informed the Registrar of Companies that it was not a subsidiary company of any other holding company. \nHowever, the Court said such an admission could be explained by looking into the Director’s report attached to the audited balance sheet which showed that AES Chhattisgarh Energy was an affiliate of AES India.\n“While examining the documents submitted by Accused No. 1 company with Registrar of Companies, this Director’s Report cannot be ignored. Whereas in the Form 23AC submitted on behalf of Accused No. 1 company, it mentioned that it is not a subsidiary of any other holding company, but in the Directors Report, it was made clear that accused No. 1 company is affiliate of AES India Private Ltd and will be implementing the project in terms of memorandum of understanding with Government of Chhattisgarh,” the Court noted.\nIt concluded that the Director's report had made it clear that AES Chhattisgarh Energy is an affiliate and a subsidiary of AES India Private Limited. \n“It is obvious that it was a blatant mistake on the part of AES Chhattisgarh Energy Private Ltd to mention in its Form 23 AC that it is not a subsidiary of any holding company whereas it was subsidiary of AES Corporation, USA,” it added. \nIn this context, the Court opined that there was gross negligence in the way the financial documents of the company AES Chhattisgarh Energy Private Ltd were prepared and submitted before the Registrar of Companies. \nThus, the Court said the accused had suffered the trial for their own mistakes. However, it added that fortunately, they (the accused) produced all evidence available with them to show that AES Chhattisgarh Energy Private Ltd was a subsidiary of AES Corporation, USA.\nThe Court also rejected the CBI’s case that AES Corporation had only later started mentioning AES Chhattisgarh Energy as its subsidiary in its Annual Reports. \nIt accepted the explanation that the AES Corporation's Annual Report mentioned that the list of subsidiaries omits certain non-significant subsidiaries and that AES Chhattisgarh Energy was not a significant subsidiary till the end of 2006.  \nConcluding that AES Chhattisgarh Energy was a 100 percent subsidiary of the US company, the Court said the charges against the accused were not proven.\n\"The accused are acquitted,\" it, therefore, ordered.\nSenior Advocate RS Cheema with Advocates AP Singh, Sanjay Kumar, NP Srivastava, VK Patha, Tarannum Cheema and Akshay Nagrajan represented the CBI.\nSenior Advocate Vikas Pahwa with Advocates Tanvir Ahmed Mir, Rajeev Goyal, Bishwajit Dubey, Gaurav Gupta, Surabhi Khattar, Ashutosh Singh, Dakshita Chopra, Prabhav Ralli, Nancy Shamim, Saud Khan and Shaurea Tyagi represented the accused."}
{"ID": "id_1018", "Summary": "The Delhi High Court recently quashed criminal proceedings against a commercial pilot who was accused of flying passengers on an Air India plane twice without undergoing a breath analyser test [Arvind Kathpalia v. State].   \nThe pilot was charged with a host of offences including forgery by the Delhi Police, and the case was pending before a trial court. \nAt the same time, the disciplinary authority of Air India had filed a chargesheet against the petitioner, alleging acts of forgery and misconduct. The airline had eventually exonerated the petitioner after noting that the Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) had adequately punished him twice.\nTaking note of the closure of disciplinary proceedings against the pilot, Justice Saurabh Banerjee, said,\n“The continuance of the FIR under the aforesaid circumstances shall, in the opinion of this Court, result in the petitioner undergoing the ordeal twice over again for the same offence. The petitioner cannot be subjected to double jeopardy for the same offence, once after having been given a clean chit on merits in the disciplinary proceedings.” \nThe Court highlighted that once Air India had closed the disciplinary proceedings against the petitioner after going through the relevant records, not much remained for the FIR alleging similar offences to proceed. \n“This court is of the opinion that allegations against the petitioner, are wholly insufficient to make out a case against him, much less for keeping the FIR alive. Moreover, in view of the prevailing facts involved and the legal position discussed here in above, in the opinion of this Court, subsistence of the present criminal proceedings emanating from the FIR in question against the petitioner, is likely to result in subjecting him to unwarranted injustice,” it said.\nIt added the there was “hardly any ground” leading to the conviction of the petitioner in the present case, which was based on facts that were “no more alive”.\nCase records showed that the petitioner flew from Delhi to Bangalore on January 19, 2017, without taking the mandatory pre-flight breath analyser test.

{"ID": "id_1020", "Summary": "Laws and rules of the State must be published in the English language and English translations of the law must be made available if the law is enacted in a regional language, the Kerala High Court recently said [PH Babu Ansari & Anr. v. The Municipal Corporation].\nJustice Bechu Kurian Thomas noted that this was also required under the Constitution of India, and opined that the enactment of laws in English would not harm the growth of regional languages.\n\"Enacting laws in English as mandated by the Constitution in a diverse country like India, will not have any bearing on the growth of the regional language. On the other hand, it can enhance the growth potential of the State as an investment destination with better awareness about its laws,” the judge said.\nThe enactment of laws in English could attract more investments since such laws would be more understandable to a wider audience especially when the State is inviting global investments, the Court explained. \n“The need for publishing statutes and rules in English language need not be reiterated. When a State like Kerala opens its invitation for people from all over the world to invest, it would be incongruous if the laws were incomprehensible to them. The importance of English as an international language of communication and comprehension within and outside the Country cannot be ignored. Parochial considerations have to be kept aside while contemplating growth and development of the State,\" the Court said. \nJustice Thomas proceeded to urge the State government to abide by its constitutional duty to provide legal texts in English. Otherwise, the Court would be compelled to issue directions on the issue, the judge warned. \n“This Court reminds the State Government to abide by the Constitutional obligation to prepare the texts of all Statutes, Rules, and other enactments in English, lest this Court be compelled to issue appropriate directions in that regard,” the November 24 judgment read. \nThe High Court made these observations while considering a plea to remove a certain plot of property from the 'park and open space' category in the Kottayam Structural Plan/Master Plan. \nThe property owners (petitioners) who filed the plea also sought the approval of their building permit applications and permission to construct buildings without adhering to the Master Plan's restrictions.\nThe petitioners claimed that the municipal authority had neglected to formally acquire the plot within the two years stipulated under the law, despite the petitioners issuing purchase notices indicating that they would be buying the said plot. \nThe municipal authorities replied that the property was zoned for a 'park and open space,' and that the petitioners did not have any permission yet to construct buildings on the said plot.\nThe authorities also argued that the purchase notice sent by the petitioners was not in the format prescribed under the relevant State rules. \nThe High Court, however, granted the property owners relief on finding that there was no specific format prescribed in the Kerala Town and Country Planning Act, 2016, or its rules when it came to purchase notices. \nPertinently, the Court observed that the rules under the 2016 Act were available only in Malayalam. This prompted the Court to take note of the larger issue of State rules not being available in English. \n“The legislature and the rule making authority are bound to issue an English translation, simultaneous with the introduction and passing of the law and the Rules. The requirement of an English text is a Constitutional obligation and cannot be avoided,\" the Court emphasised. \nThe Court proceeded to allow the property owners' plea and directed the authorities to process their building permit applications. \nThe Court reasoned that the authorities ought to have acquired the plot within two years after marking it as a \"park and open space\" if they wanted to take control of the plot. \nThe Court also noted that in the absence of any prescribed form, the property owners had issued a purchase notice that conveyed its intent and purpose. The failure of the State to prescribe the format of such a notice cannot hinder a property owner's rights, the Court said. \nThe petitioners were represented by Senior Advocates VV Asokan along with advocates KI Mayankutty Mather, T Sreekala, and S Parvathi.\nThe municipal authorities were represented by Senior Government Pleader K Amminikutty and Standing Counsel CS Manilal."}
{"ID": "id_1021", "Summary": "The Madhya Pradesh High Court recently awarded compensation of ₹1 lakh each to two persons whose houses were illegally demolished by Ujjain Municipal Corporation [Radha Langri and Anr vs The Commissioner, Municipal Corporation Ujjain and Ors.]\nJustice Vivek Rusia observed that it has now become 'fashionable' for local bodies to demolish houses without complying with principles of natural justice.\n\"It has become fashionable now for local administration and local bodies to demolish any house by drawing up proceedings without complying with the principles of natural justice and publish it in the newspaper,\" the Court said. \nThe Court was hearing a plea by two individuals seeking compensation and disciplinary action against the municipal corporation officials and injunction from demolishing the remaining portion of their houses.\nThe first petitioner informed the Court that one house belonging to her and one belonging to her husband in Sandapani Nagar, Ujjain were demolished on December 13, 2022 without prior notice.\nThe second petitioner was served two notices and given only a day's time to reply before three of her houses in the same locality were demolished.\nAdvocate Rishi Tiwari for the corporation argued that the houses were raised in violation of the provisions of the Act as no building permission was obtained for the same. Hence, he contended that the demolition was justified.\nThe commissioner of the corporation told the Court that the houses claimed to be owned by the first petitioner and her husband were actually owned by other people and were demolished after the owners did not respond to notices. \nThe Court noted that there were registered sale deeds in the name of the petitioners and that they had not approached the corporation for mutation of their name.\n\"Although they did not inform about the aforesaid sale to the Municipal Corporation by submitting a registered sale deed for mutation of their name, they are residing in the said house as owner\" it added.\nAdditionally, the Court noted that had the building officer visited the site, he would have been informed about the ownership situation and would have realized that they were not serving notices to actual owners. \nAccordingly, the Court concluded that the panchnama was not drawn at the spot and was concocted. It also noted that the purported owner of the first petitioner's properties did not even exist.\nTherefore, the Court determined that service of notice to a fictitious person was highly illegal and arbitrary, for which disciplinary action had to be taken against the officials responsible. It also underlined that the ownership details could have been verified based on property tax receipts.\nThe Court further noted that the petitioners purchased a constructed house and if there was no permission for the same, there is a provision for compounding also. \n\"It is correct that no person has a right to construct the house without building permission or if the building permission is there then no construction is permissible in the MOS area. In either case, demolition should be the last recourse to be followed that too after giving a proper opportunity to the owner of the house to get it regularized,\" it added.\nConsequently, the Court ordered compensation of ₹1 lakh each to the petitioners for the illegal demolitions. Furthermore, it directed the Commissioner of the Municipal Corporation to initiate disciplinary action against the officers responsible for the faulty spot panchnamas. Additionally, the Court instructed the petitioners to apply for regularization of their constructions.\nThe petitioners were represented by advocate Tehjeeb Khan."}

The petitioner nevertheless asked the Court to invoke its 'parens patriae' jurisdiction on the ground that even though the missing girl is now major, she is a vulnerable adult.\nThe Court, however, rejected the same.\n\"The exercise of that jurisdiction (parens patriae) should not transgress into the area of determining the suitability of the partners to a marital tie. That decision rests exclusively with the individuals themselves. Neither the State nor society can intrude into that domain,\" the Court ruled. \nThe Court also interacted with the girl in open court and examined her statement wherein she clearly stated that she wanted to continue living with her husband and not with her parents.\nThe Court relied upon Supreme Court judgments, particularly the judgment in Hadiya case, to hold that Court that parens patriae doctrine has to be exercised only in exceptional situations in case of persons who are incapable of asserting free will such as minors or persons of unsound mind.\nThe parens patriae jurisdiction of the Court should not transgress into an area of determining the suitability of the partners to a marital tie, it said. \n\"The strength of our Constitution lies in its acceptance of the plurality and diversity of our culture\", the Court said. \n\"The intimacies of marriage, including the choices which individuals make on whether or not to marry and on whom to marry, lie outside the control of the State. Courts as upholders of consitutional freedoms must safeguard these freedoms,\" the Court added.\nThe petitioner claimed that his daughter was kidnapped from Aurangabad in 2019. A complaint was lodged with the police leading to registration of FIR against unknown persons.\nAfter a few days, the petitioner's wife informed him that one Fukran Khan was allegedly responsible for the incident and had kidnapped their daughter in collusion with his parents.\nDespite recording this statement, the police purportedly did not proceed to take any steps for finding out the whereabouts of the petitioners daughter compelling him to approach the High Court under the writ jurisdiction.\nAs per the daughter's version, she had a child in September 2020 when she was nine months short of being an adult and had gotten married in June 2021.\nThe Court discovered that the daughter had expressed her desire to marry her present husband. However, her parents had refused to grant permission for the same.\nWhen she pursued her desire, her parents even subjected her to physical assault and was sent to her maternal uncle's house from where she ran away to Nagpur, she contended. \nAfter contacting her husband, the couple moved Bhainsa in Telangana where she gave birth to a child and got married.\nAdvocate AV Indrale Patil submitted that in the peculiar facts of the present case it would be just and proper for the Court to invoke the parens patriae doctrine.\nThe Court observed that while the petitioner-father approached the Court with the bonafide intention to protect the interest of his daughter, the same could not be at the cost to curtail the fundamental rights of the daughter, who, out of her own free will voluntarily got married.\nIn view of the facts of the present case, the Court opined that the doctrine of parens patriae is inapplicable. \nThe Court, therefore, ordered that the girl is at liberty to live her life in accordance with law."}

Admittedly, no such incriminating material was recovered from the possession of the present accused-appellant (Alam),\" the Court noted.\nMohammad Alam was the driver of the taxi taken by Kappan and two other accused to travel to Hathras for the purpose of reporting on the gang-rape and murder of a 19-year-old Dalit girl.\nAlam arrested along with the others in October 2020.\nHe was charged under Sections 17 and 18 of the UAPA, Sections 124A (sedition), Section 153A (promoting enmity between different groups on ground of religion) and Section 295A (deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings) of the Indian Penal Code, along with Sections 65 and72 of the Information Technology Act.\nThe bench took note of the fact that the only evidence against Alam was that he paid about ₹2 lakh to one Mohd. Aneesh to purchase a car just few days before the incident and his relative was involved in the Delhi riots while protesting against the Citizenship Amendment Act. \n\"In regard to the above two alleged evidences, the appellant has given a prima facie plausible explanation,\" said the court. \nIt was recorded that the money paid by him was borrowed from his cousin, who has filed an affidavit explaining the source of money. \nAs far as his relative with antecedents was concerned, he admitted that Danish was his cousin, but specifically denied any connection with the crime.\nFurther, it was observed that no allegations were placed before the court to show that the appellant would terrorise witnesses or abscond if released. \nIn view of the above, Alam was admitted to regular bail until conclusion of trial on furnishing a personal bond of ₹50,000.\nEarlier this month, the Allahabad High Court refused to grant bail to Kappan. \nJustice Krishan Pahal attributed the rejection of his bail plea to a prima facie case being established by the prosecution that his travel with co-accused, as well as tainted money being used by him and his colleagues, were crucial circumstances going against him.\nThe Court had also reasoned that Kappan's defence that he was visiting Hathras to fulfil his journalistic duty was nullified by the claims made by the prosecution in the charge sheet.\nAdvocates Amarjeet Singh Rakhra, Bashith Muni Mishra, Sheeran Mohiuddin Alavi and Saipan Shaikh appeared for the petitioner while Additional Government Advocate Umesh Chandra Verma appeared for the respondents."}
{"ID": "id_1027", "Summary": "The Nagpur Bench of Bombay High Court recently held that it is only in ‘rarest of rare' cases that a High Court may, in exercise of its inherent powers under Section 482 of Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), quash criminal proceedings based on settlement between the parties after conviction.\nA Full Bench comprising Justices AS Chandurkar, Vinay Joshi and NB Suryawanshi concluded that “it would be a sound exercise of discretion under Section 482 of the Code and in accordance with the law of the land to refuse to quash criminal proceedings post-conviction for a non- compoundable offence only on the ground that the parties have entered into a compromise.\" \nInstead, the court can permit the convicted party to bring to the notice of the appellate/revisional court, the aspect of compromise, the Bench added. \nThe Court noted that it is not permissible to set aside the judgment of conviction at the appellate/revisional stage only on the ground that the parties have entered into a compromise.\nThus, if the judgment of conviction cannot be set aside in an appeal/revision only on the ground that the parties have entered into a compromise, similar result cannot be obtained in a proceeding under Section 482 of the CrPC, it was held. \nThe Bench was deciding the extent of powers exercisable under Section 482 in view of conflicting judgments by co-ordinate benches of the High Court in this regard. \nA Division Bench at Aurangabad had held in Udhav Kisanrao Ghodse Vs. State of Maharashtra that since the parties had decided to maintain good and cordial relations in future and such an attitude was beneficial to the society, inherent powers under Section 482 were required to be invoked. In this regard, reliance was placed on Abasaheb Yadav Honmane v. State of Maharashtra and Gian Singh v. State of Punjab and Anr.\nThe judgment of Udhav Ghodse came to be followed by a Division Bench of Nagpur in Ajmatkhan S/o. Rahematkhan, & Anr. v. State of Maharashtra. \nIn that judgment, it was reiterated that the power under Section 482 for quashing the proceedings could be exercised even after conviction of an accused.\nConversely, a co-ordinate bench at Nagpur in Maya Sanjay Khandare and anr. v. State of Maharashtra opined that exercise of power under Section 482 ought to be exercised rarely rather than being invoked frequently. \nThe Full Bench refused to agree with the proposition that in cases where a settlement was reached between convict and complainant, the conviction can be quashed by invoking inherent powers. \nThey opined that the inherent power “could not be invoked merely on the ground of settlement between the parties. \nThe remedy of challenging the order of conviction is available to the accused by way of an appeal. Any compromise entered into post-conviction for a non-compoundable offence cannot by itself result in acquittal of the accused.\nThe compromise entered into, therefore, is just a mitigating factor that can be taken into account while hearing the appeal/revision challenging the conviction and can be taken into consideration while imposing appropriate punishment/sentence. It is not permissible to set aside the judgment of conviction at the appellate/revisional stage only on the ground that the parties have entered into a compromise.\nThe Court also set out an example to show when the inherent jurisdiction can be invoked.\n\"To illustrate, where a jurisdictional issue going to the root of the matter is raised for challenging the conviction or in matrimonial disputes where the parties have agreed to settle their differences, jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Code could be exercised. Such exercise of jurisdiction should be limited to the rarest of rare cases when found necessary to prevent the abuse of the process of the Court or to secure the ends of justice,\" the judgment said."}

The NCLT would be able to consider the whole picture, as it were, about the nature of the assets available, either during the corporate debtor’s insolvency process, or even later; this would facilitate the CoC in framing realistic plans, keeping in mind the prospect of realizing some part of the creditors’ dues from personal guarantors,\" the Court ruled. \nThe Court also held that the November 2019 notification is not an instance of legislative exercise, or amounting to impermissible and selective application of provisions of the Code. \n\"There is no compulsion in the Code that it should, at the same time, be made applicable to all individuals, (including personal guarantors) or not at all,\" the court said. \nApproval of a resolution plan does not ipso facto discharge a personal guarantor (of a corporate debtor) of her or his liabilities under the contract of guarantee.\nreads judgment\nThe Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI) had sought the transfer of all the matters pending before the High Courts to the Supreme Court so as to avoid conflicting rulings by different courts.\nAll those pending writ petitions challenged the constitutional validity of Part III of the IBC, which deals with insolvency resolution for individuals and partnership firms.\nThe top court, while transferring all the petitions to itself in October last year, had stated that the IBC was at a nascent stage and that it was better for the Court to take up the interpretation of the provisions of the Code so as to avoid any confusion, and to authoritatively settle the law.\n\"Considering the importance of the issues raised in the Writ Petitions which need finality of judicial determination at the earliest, it is just and proper that the Writ Petitions are transferred from the High Courts to this Court,\" the Supreme Court had noted in its order. \nWrit petitions were filed in the Delhi High Court and other High Courts challenging the 2019 notification and the Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Application to Adjudicating Authority for Insolvency Resolution Process of Personal Guarantors to Corporate Debtors) Rules, 2019 as well as a number of similar Rules.\nThe petitioners also sought that Sections 95, 96, 99, 100, 101 of the IBC be declared unconstitutional in so far as they apply to personal guarantors of corporate debtors.\nVide the 2019 notification, the Union Ministry of Corporate Affairs had brought into force the following provisions of the IBC insofar as they related to personal guarantors to corporate debtors:\ni.

{"ID": "id_103", "Summary": "The Supreme Court on Tuesday dismissed a plea filed by journalist Rana Ayyub challenging the jurisdiction of a Ghaziabad court that commenced proceedings against her in a Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) case (Rana Ayyub v.

Hence, this question should be raised by the petitioner before the Special Court, since an answer to the same would depend upon evidence as to the places where any one or more of the processes or activities mentioned in Section 3 were carried out.\"\nThe Supreme Court had last week reserved its verdict in the journalist's plea.\nAyyub was summoned by a trial court in Ghaziabad in relation to a prosecution complaint filed by the Enforcement Directorate (ED).\nAyyub moved the apex court contending that the Uttar Pradesh court does not have jurisdiction to hear the matter since the complaint arose in Mumbai and the Delhi Zonal Office of ED was investigating the matter.\nThe Supreme Court at the outset noted that the following questions arose in the matter: \nWhether the trial of the offence of money-laundering should follow the trial of the scheduled/predicate offence or vice versa?\nWhether the Court of the Special Judge, Anti-Corruption, CBI Court No.1, Ghaziabad, can be said to have exercised extra-territorial jurisdiction, even though the offence alleged, was not committed within the jurisdiction of the said Court?\nIt was pointed out that as per the PMLA, the Special Court constituted under Section 43(1) is empowered to try even the scheduled offence connected to the same.\n\" ... the trial of the scheduled offence, insofar as the question of territorial jurisdiction is concerned, should follow the trial of the offence of money-laundering and not vice versa\", the top court explains. \nOn the first question, the top court observed that if the scheduled offence is taken cognisance of by any other judicial forum, courts can commit the same after necessary applications by the concerned authorities.\nOn the second question, the judges began by stating that in money-laundering cases,\n\" ... the area in which the place of acquisition of the proceeds of crime is located or the place of keeping it in possession is located or the place in which it is concealed is located or the place in which it is used is located, will be the area in which the offence has been committed.\"\nTaking note of the fact that the donations in question were received from different parts of the country online, the Court said,\n\"Therefore, the question of territorial jurisdiction in this case requires an enquiry into a question of fact as to the place where the alleged proceeds of crime were (i) concealed; or (ii) possessed; or (iii) acquired; or (iv) used. This question of fact will actually depend upon the evidence that unfolds before the Trial Court.\"\nThe ED had initiated a money laundering investigation on the basis of a First Information Report (FIR) registered in September 2021 by the Indirapuram Police Station in Ghaziabad under provisions of the Indian Penal Code, the Information Technology Amendment Act and the Black Money Act against Ayyub.\nThe FIR alleged that she illegally acquired funds from the general public in the name of charity by launching fundraiser campaigns on online crowd funding platform Ketto.\nIt was also alleged that Ayyub received foreign contributions without registration under the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA).\nAccording to the ED, investigation revealed that Ayyub launched three fundraiser campaigns and collected funds totalling ₹2.69 crore.\nThese included:\n1. Raising funds for slum-dwellers & farmers;\n2. Funds for relief work for Assam, Bihar and Maharashtra;\n3. Funds to help those impacted by COVID-19 in India.\nThe ED stated that the funds raised were received in her father and sister's accounts, and were subsequently transferred to her personal accounts. Further, she allegedly utilised these funds to create a fixed deposit of ₹50 lakh for herself and transferred another ₹50 lakh to a new bank account.\nThe investigation was also stated to have revealed that only about ₹29 lakh was used for relief work. Subsequently, a bank balance of ₹1.7 crore was attached by the agency on February 4, 2022.\nAdvocate Vrinda Grover appeared for Ayyub. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta appeared for the ED."}

As per Article 195 from the book ‘Principles of Mohammedan Law by Sir Dinshah Fardunji Mulla’, the petitioner No.2 being over 16 years of age was competent to enter into a contract of marriage with a person of her choice”, noted the single-judge.\nThe petitioners moved the court on the ground that their life and liberty was in grave danger at the hands of the respondents. Thus, they sought a direction to the police to consider their representation seeking protection.\nThe petitioner submitted that as per Muslim law, puberty and majority are one and the same, and that there is a presumption that a person attained majority at 15 years of age.\nIt was further contended that a Muslim boy or girl who attains puberty is at liberty to marry anyone they liked, and guardians had no right to interfere.\nThe Court, in this regard, placed reliance on the judgment in Yunus Khan v State of Haryana where it was noted that a Muslim girl’s age of marriage was governed by Muslim personal law.\nThe Court also adverted to Article 195 from the book ‘Principles of Mohammedan Law' by Sir Dinshah Fardunji Mulla which states that 'every Mahomedan of sound mind, who has attained puberty, may enter into a contract of marriage'.\nThe explanation to that Article provides that puberty is presumed, in the absence of evidence, on completion of the age of fifteen years.\nIn this case, since the girl was over 16 years and boy was stated to be over 21 years old, both the petitioners were concluded to be of marriageable age.\nMoreover, the Court pointed out that the issue in the petition was not with regard to the validity of the petitioner’s marriage, but protection of their fundamental rights.\n“The Court cannot shut its eyes to the fact that the apprehension of the petitioners needs to be addressed. Merely because the petitioners have got married against the wishes of their family members, they cannot possibly be deprived of the fundamental rights as envisaged in the Constitution of India”, said Justice Bedi.\nWith this, the Senior Superintendent of Police, Pathankot was directed to decide the petitioners’ representation and take action accordingly.\nAdvocate Sanjeev Kumar represented the petitioners."}
{"ID": "id_1031", "Summary": "The Delhi High Court recently expressed its anguish at the way cases of sexual harassment are registered “at the drop of a hat”, stating that this effectively hampers the cause of woman empowerment [Dr Karunakar Patra v State and Ors].\nJustice Subramonium Prasad observed that the filing of such cass trivialises a serious offence and casts a doubt on the veracity of allegations filed by every other victim. \n“This Court expresses its anguish at how provisions such as Sections 354A/506 IPC are falsely invoked at the drop of a hat to register one’s displeasure at the conduct of another individual. This merely trivialises the offence of sexual harassment and casts a doubt on the veracity of the allegations filed by every other victim who has in reality faced sexual harassment, thereby setting back the cause of women empowerment,” the single-judge said.\nThe Court was dealing with a petition filed by a Delhi University professor seeking the quashing of a first information report (FIR) registered by his neighbour under Sections 354A (punishment for sexual harassment) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code.\nIt was argued that while the petitioner and his family were out of the city, their neighbour demolished a cemented water tank that had been constructed for his flat at the rooftop. The neighbours even constructed a room and a toilet, and broke the pipe that was used to supply water to the petitioner's flat.\nThough the petitioner made several representations to the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) and the Delhi Police to act on the illegal construction, no action was taken against them, allegedly because the daughter-in-law of their neighbour was a Constable with the Delhi Police.\nThe Court was told that in February 2021, in response to a written complaint by the petitioner and his wife, the police called them to the station and asked them to settle the matter. On a refusal to do the same, the neighbours then registered the FIR against the petitioner and his wife. It was alleged that the police asked them to pay ₹5 lakh as bribe to settle the matter.\nThe Bench observed that the content of the FIR was sketchy in nature, and it was devoid of any specifics regarding the offences which were alleged to have been committed.\n“While this Court is cognizant of the fact that an FIR is not an encyclopaedia which must disclose all facts and details, however, in the instant case, a bare reading of the impugned FIR No.89/2021 prima facie indicates that the FIR arises out of bald allegations and contradictory statements.”\nIt added that a comprehensive reading of the matter revealed that the FIR was merely a counterblast and solely registered to arm-twist the petitioner and his wife into withdrawing the complaints that had been filed against the neighbours.\n“A reading of the Status Report also does not reveal anything about the offences being referred to in the impugned FIR. The Status Report states that the Petitioner and his wife were habitual complainants and have filed multiple complaints against the construction that would take place in the neighbourhood, and therefore, it is evident that the instant FIR was maliciously instituted with an ulterior motive for wreaking vengeance on the Petitioner, and with a view to spite him and his wife due to a private and personal grudge.”\nThe Court therefore quashed the FIR.\nAdvocate Kumar Piyush Pushkar appeared for the petitioner.

{"ID": "id_1033", "Summary": "A victim under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 (SC/ST Act) or his dependent, should be mandatorily heard in any proceeding under the SC/ST Act as provided in Section 15A of the Act, the Supreme Court ruled on Friday (Hariram Bhambhi v. Satyanarayan & anr).\nThe condition under Section 15A to hear victim or his dependent in any proceeding for bail, discharge, release, parole, conviction or sentence is an important mandate under the Act and should be strictly construed and enforced, the top court said, setting aside the bail order passed by the Rajasthan High Court.\n\"The requirement of issuing notice of a court proceeding to a victim or a dependent under Section 15A (3), in order to provide them an opportunity of being heard, is mandatory, finds echo in multiple High Court decisions including a decision of the Rajasthan High Court. We find ourselves in agreement with the proposition and hold that sub-sections (3) and (5) of Section 15A are mandatory in nature,\" the Court stated.\nA Bench of Justices DY Chandrachud and BV Nagarathna, observed that in the instant case, the appellant (dependent of the victim) was not given notice when single-judge of Rajasthan High Court allowed the application of bail. \nWhen the appellant instituted a plea for the cancellation of bail, the single judge erroneously held that the procedural lapse during the bail hearing is inconsequential since the appellant was given an opportunity to be heard during the proceedings for cancellation of bail.\nThe Supreme Court, however, disagreed.\n\"We cannot agree with the finding of the Single Judge that the defect in not issuing notice to the victim or their dependent and depriving them of the opportunity to be heard in the concerned proceedings (for grant of bail) can be cured by providing them a hearing in a proceeding that arose subsequently (for cancellation of bail). Compliance with the principles of natural justice must be observed at every stage under the mandate of the statute,\" the apex court opined.\nThe Court further noted that atrocities against SC/STs are not a thing of the past and continue to be a reality even today. \n\"Hence, the statutory provisions which have been enacted by Parliament as a measure of protecting the constitutional rights of persons belonging to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes must be complied with and enforced conscientiously. There has been an evident breach of the statutory requirements embodied in sub-sections (3) and (5) of Section 15A in the present case,\" the Court concluded.\nApart from the procedural issues, the Court also noted that there had been no application of mind on the part of the single-judge who used the \"in the facts and circumstances\" formula to escape recording of reasons for his judgment. \n\"Recording of reasons by a judge is not a task in formality, but an exercise of judicial accountability and transparency, which makes the decision available for further scrutiny at the touchstone of reason and justice...There is absolutely no reasoning in the order of the High Court granting bail, after recording the submissions of the first respondent’s counsel apart from noting that the public prosecutor had opposed the bail,\" the Bench observed. \nThe Bench, therefore, set aside the bail granted by the High Court via order dated November 7, 2019 and directed Satyanarayan, the first respondent to surrender before November 7, 2021."}

The High Court had upheld the decision of the Magistrate to accept the closure report filed by the SIT in the case and had thus dismissed the petition filed by Jafri challenging the report.\nIn the aftermath of the Gujarat riots, Zakia Jafri had filed a complaint before the then Director General of Police of Gujarat in 2006, seeking registration of a First Information Report (FIR) under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), including Section 302 (Punishment for Murder). The complaint was made against various bureaucrats and politicians, including Modi who was then the Chief Minister of Gujarat.\nIn 2008, the apex court appointed an SIT to submit a report on a number of trials in relation to the riots and subsequently also ordered the SIT to investigate the complaint filed by Jafri.\nThe SIT report gave a clean chit to Modi and in 2011, the SIT was directed by the Supreme Court to submit its closure report before the concerned Magistrate, and the petitioner was given the liberty to file her objections, if any, to the said report.\nIn 2013, after the petitioner was handed a copy of the same, she filed a petition opposing the closure report. \nThe Magistrate upheld the SIT’s closure report and dismissed the petition filed by Jafri. Aggrieved, the petitioner had approached the Gujarat High Court which in 2017, upheld the Magistrate’s decision and dismissed the petition filed by Jafri.\nJafri along with activist Teesta Setalvad then approached the Supreme Court by way of the present petition challenging this decision to accept the SIT’s clean chit.\nDuring the hearing, counsel for the petitioner, Senior Advocate Kapil Sibal claimed that the SIT did not examine all the material available and that its investigation showed bias. He argued that the State aided in propagating hate.\n\"The point here is that the dead bodies were flashed on the TV channels in that state, that obviously led to the anger....Material was circulated to push for economic boycott of Muslims. Mutilated pictures of Sabarmati Express, pamphlets of do-it-yourself brutalities were circulated. The material was given to the SIT, they never looked at it,\" Sibal stated.\nSibal also said that the SIT itself should be investigated for rendering conclusions contrary to facts. \nThe SIT did not do 'investigation' but did a 'collaborative exercise' and its probe was fraught with omissions to protect conspirators.\nSibal said that there was evidence in the form of electronic records including call data records of senior police officials and mobs identifying houses of Muslims, all of which pointed towards conspiracy.\nBut the SIT ignored all of it and did not conduct any further investigation into the and the Magistrate and High Court too chose to overlook the same, he contended.\nSenior Advocate Mukul Rohatgi refuted the claims made by Sibal that dead bodies were paraded around.\n\"All this is there in the report. Doctors were called to the platform. Bodies were moved in convoy including this Patel (VHP leader). Right or wrong, VHP is concerned because their supporters were killed. Can there be parading between 12 and 3 am when people are in their homes? 33 out of 58 dead belonged to Ahmedabad so a decision was taken to bring them to Ahmedabad so the transfer to kith and kin is easy,\" he submitted.\nSolicitor General Tushar Mehta for the State government claimed that the State did \"everything it could.\" He had posed questions against the credibility of petitioner number 2, Citizens for Justice and Teesta Setalvad, claiming that she embezzled money donated for the welfare of riot victims. He argued that Setalvad was the force behind Zakia Jafri, taking advantage of her plight to push for action.\nRead more about the arguments here."}

Union of India & Ors.]\nThe order came in a plea filed by three LIC policyholders challenging the forthcoming public offering and issuance of shares to the public by LIC. It challenged the portion under Finance Act which sought to amend the LIC Act.\nAn ad-interim prayer was to stay the DRHP, which was rejected by the Bench of Justices Gautam Patel and Madhav Jamdar.\nThe Bench however clarified that any public issue that LIC proceeds with between now and till the disposal of the writ petition will be subject to the final decision in the writ petition.\nThe Central government is planning to divest 5% of its stake in the company through the IPO.\n50% of the net issue is reserved for qualified institutional buyers and non-institutional buyers will have 15% shares allocation, as per reports.\nThe petition raised two fold contentions:\nThat the Finance Bill that was a pre-cursor to the Finance Act 2021 could never have been passed as a Money Bill under Article 110 of the Constitution of India\nThat the Finance Act, and specifically the amendments introduced by it to the LIC Act are ultra vires Article 300A of the Constitution of India.\nThe petition contended that an allocation or reservation immediately gives every policyholder an estate in the surplus of the corporation.\n“…every single existing policyholder from LIC has a direct, enforceable and realizable interest in surplus. That surplus is, therefore, the “property of” every policyholder and of all policyholders as a class”, the petition stated.\nWhat the Finance Act 2021 seeks to do was introduce a new class of claimants to the surplus (shareholders) while earlier the entire cake belonged to policyholders, it was contended.\nThis would amount to deprivation of property, which was in violation of Article 300A of the Constitution of India, the petitioner submitted. \nThe Court was, however, not convinced that policyholders could have an enforceable estate in the surplus of LIC fund.\n“…we do not see how this class of persons can say that the surplus or any part of the LIC fund is their ‘property’ within the meaning of Article 300-A of the Constitution of India. It may be one thing to say that a person has an entitlement to receive a dividend or a bonus or some form of payment. That might conceptually be very different from saying that the person has an in specie interest in the fund itself,” the order reasoned.\nSenior Advocate Pradeep Sancheti with Advocates Pulkit Sharma, Pooja Kane, Pallavi Bali, Saurabh Bachawat and Zaman Ali appeared for the petitioners.\nAdditional Solicitor General N Venkataraman with Advocates Amita Katragadda, Prakhar Pandey, Preksha Malik, Gathi Prakash, Nidhi Asher, Isha Choudhary and Arushi Poddar briefed by Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas appeared for LIC."}
{"ID": "id_1041", "Summary": "The Bombay High Court has granted relief to actress Kangana Ranaut in her plea challenging demolition activity by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on her property in Bandra last September. \nThe Court has quashed the demolition notice and added that Ranaut may take steps to make her property habitable and to regularise the same. \nThe Court has also directed the appointment of a valuer to determine the compensation payable to Ranaut for the demolition of her property. \nHighlights of the order include:\nThe notice of demolition issued against Kangana Ranaut's property is quashed and set aside. MCGM has proceeded on wrongful grounds against the rights of the citizens. It is nothing but malice in law. \nCourt orders compensation against the loss caused to Kangana Ranaut. A valuer has been appointed. Orders reserved on the compensation for after a report is given. \nRanaut is allowed to take steps to make her property habitable. But that would be in compliance with the approved plan. If application made to BMC for approval, it will decided within 4 weeks.\nRanaut can make an application for regularisation. No further steps can be taken by the BMC against such regularisation till the application disposed of. M/s Shetgiri is appointed as valuer. Charges to be borne by Ranaut. In case of any issues, she can approach the Court\nThe Court today ruled that there was no unauthorised construction as alleged by the BMC on Ranaut's property, finding that it was only existing work as opposed to illegal alterations.\nThe Bench of Justices SJ Kathawalla and RI Chagla ultimately concluded that the BMC had proceeded on wrongful grounds in this case and against rights of the citizens, which is nothing but malice in law.\nThe Court noted that after a perusal of the photographs of the photographs of the property and a comparison, it has concluded that the alleged altered constructions were existing work. \nThe Court has opined that the demolition was a reactionary activity, in view of the controversial remarks made by Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut against Ranaut, the ensuing visit of the BMC to Ranaut's property, the timeline of the demolition activity and the attempts made to delay the High Court hearing in the matter which resulted in 40% of the demolition being carried out.\n\"We would however refrain from giving verdict on malice\", the Court said.\nHoweber, it opined:\n\"Even if one assumes that the malice does not amount to personal bias and may call for a trial, it does amount to legal malice. The manner in which the action was carried out leaves no doubt that not using Section 354 was more sinister and preventing her from taking a recourse.\"\nThe Bench, however, remarked that Ranaut should show restraint in airing her opinions on the government. Ranaut has been vocally critical of the Shiv Sena-led State Government in Maharashtra.\nThe Court had reserved their verdict over a month back, on October 5.\nRead the order:\nThe plea arose after BMC commenced demolition activity on Ranaut's property on September 9. After Ranaut moved and urgent plea in the Court, it restrained the BMC from carrying on further demolition activity and to explain their conduct.\nWhen the matter was taken up for further hearing the same afternoon, the Court pulled up the BMC officials for acting in an unusually swift manner to demolish portions of Ranaut's property, despite her having moved the Court around the same time when the demolition had started.\nThe BMC filed its reply the next day claiming that Ranaut had carried out illegal alterations and additions on her property. \nAdvocate Rizwan Siddique, appearing for Ranaut, sought for more from the Court to amend the plea to place on record certain additional facts. The Court granted time to Siddique to amend the plea and in the meantime extended its stay on the demolition till September 22.\nRanaut also filed a rejoinder to BMC's reply to their original plea before the September 22 hearing. \nHer amended plea contained allegationd against the Sanjay Raut, Chief Spokesperson of the Shiv Sena. On September 22, the Court asked her to either implead Raut in the plea so as to give him an opportunity to defend himself or not to pursue the claims against him.\nWith Ranaut decideding to pursue her allegations against him, the Court allowed her to implead Raut in the plea as also one designated officer of the BMC.\nOn September 23, Raut's lawyer, Advocate Pradeep Thorat sought more time to file Raut's reply. The Court granted time to the newly added parties to file their reply before their turn to address the court. However, the Bench clarified that hearing on Ranaut's submissions will begin from September 24.\nOn September 24, Senior Advocate Birendra Saraf, appearing for Ranaut, began his submissions, arguing that the BMC had flouted their own statutory provisions and guidelines before and while carrying out the demolition work on Ranaut's property. \nSaraf added that the provisions granted Ranaut an opportunity to rectify the purported illegality in her structure. However, the officials did not give her such an opportunity. He added that every action of BMC reeked of malafide intentions. \nWhen the hearing continued on September 29, both BMC and Raut faced criticism from the Court on the manner in which they had acted.\nThe Court reprimanded Raut for his derogatory remarks against Ranaut. They also mused upon why BMC officials had not taken any action against the Ranaut's super-structure for such a long time until the day they sent her notice.\nSenior Advocate Aspi Chinoy, arguing for BMC, replied that the treatement meted out to Ranaut was not exceptional, as claimed. He further submitted that BMC had no political connections and that the controversy in this matter was created by Kangana going to the media. Referring to BMC’s affidavit, he claimed that Kangana was carrying out brazen and illegal alterations, and that she has conveniently remained silent on that aspect.\nHe reiterated that she had an alternate remedies available and should have exhausted those before moving the High Court's extraordinary jurisdiction.\nSenior Advocate Anil Sakhare, appearing for the BMC officer summoned by the Court, asked the Bench to consider that Ranaut had a higher burden to prove malice against the officer which she had not been able to prove.\nAfter directing all parties to file their written submissions, the Court reserved the matter for orders."}

It may in a given case involve cheating; it is possible theoretically yet in order to prove an offence of cheating in such cases prosecution must have reliable and trustworthy evidence in order to first prosecute such a case. There is no such evidence before the prosecution and therefore no offence under Section 417 is also made out,\" the Court held.\nThe Court was hearing an appeal filed by the petitioner against a July 2021 order of the Karnataka High Court which had quashed the case against other family members of the petitioner but declined to quash the case against him. \nThe case stemmed from a complaint lodged by the woman alleged to have been cheated by the petitioner by not going through with the marriage. \nAs per the complaint, she was working as a lecturer when her family was searching for a suitable bridegroom and zeroed in on the petitioner as a prospective match. \nThe two then started talking to each other over the phone and the woman's father also gave ₹75,000 in advance to a marriage hall.\nHowever, the marriage did not materialise after she learnt from a newspaper report that the petitioner had married someone else.\nShe then lodged a complaint against six persons including the petitioner and a first information report (FIR) was registered against them under Section 406 (criminal breach of trust), 417 (cheating) and 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property) of the Indian Penal Code.\nThe accused persons then moved the High Court under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for quashing the case.\nThe High Court quashed the FIR with respect to offences under Sections 406 and 420 against all the accused. As regards Section 417, the High Court concluded that the same was made out against the petitioner though not against other accused persons. \nThe petitioner then moved the Supreme Court for relief.\nThe Court, after examining the relevant provision and the case laws, said that in order to attract the offence of cheating, there should be an intention to deceive or cheat right from the beginning.\n\"Time and again, this Court has reiterated that in order to make out an offence under cheating the intention to cheat or deceive should be right from the beginning. By no stretch of imagination, this is even reflected from the complaint made by the informant,\" the Court found.\nIn this case, the complaint itself did not reflect that the man had such an intention.\nIt, therefore, quashed the criminal case against the petitioner.\nAdvocates Sharanagouda Patil, Shivprasad Shantanagouda, Shupreeta Sharanagouda, Supreeta Patil and Jyotish Pandey of S-legal Associates appeared for the accused.\nAdvocates VN Raghupathy, Manendra Pal Gupta, M Bangaraswamy, Premnath Mishra and Dhanesh Ieshdhan appeared for the Karnataka government.\nAdvocates Rana Ranjit Singh, Vivek Kumar Singh, Ravish Singh, Akanksha Singh, Sweta Singh, Abhilash Tripayhy and Avijeet Kumar appeared for the complainant."}

Seven of these BJP MLAs were suspended on allegations that they disrupted the address of the Lieutenant Governor (LG) Vinai Kumar Saxena.\nThe suspended legislators were Vijender Gupta, Ajay Kumar Mahawar, Anil Kumar Bajpai, Om Prakash Sharma, Jitender Mahajan, Mohan Singh Bisht and Abhay Verma.\nIn a detailed judgement, the High Court held that the Speaker who is an impartial arbitrator and conducts the House has not taken any decision independently and has not held that the matter is one that requires to be referred to the Committee of Privileges.\n“In the absence of any application of mind by the Speaker in referring the matter to the Committee of Privileges and in view of the fact that the Petitioners have not been heard while being given  punishment of suspension till the Committee of Privileges decides the matter and since the punishment under Rule 77 of Chapter XI [Rules and Procedures] can be prescribed only after a Member is heard, the direction for suspending the Petitioners till the Committee of Privileges takes a decision cannot be sustained,” Justice Prasad observed.\nHe added that the upshot of this is that the decision of the House to send the issue before the Committee of Privileges without the Speaker independently applying his mind as postulated under Rule 70 of Chapter XI and the decision of the House to suspend the Petitioners till the Committee of Privileges takes a decision both are in violation of the procedure prescribed under the Fifth Schedule and Chapter XI.\n“Since the petitioners have already undergone the suspension of 14 sittings, this Court is of the opinion that the petitioners should be permitted to re-join the House forthwith,” the Court held.\nThe BJP MLAs had approached the High Court claiming that the speaker's decision to suspend them was \"grossly unconstitutional\" since almost the entire opposition was suspended from the assembly thereby, silencing any voice of accountability.\nThey argued that the motion moved by AAP MLA Dilip Pandey was \"maliciously engineered\" to disable the opposition members to participate in the discussions on crucial businesses that were to be discussed and to also exclude them from participating in the budget session of the House.\nThe BJP legislators also argued that the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) was turning their suspension into a political issue by comparing it to suspension of AAP MP Raghav Chadha from the parliament.\nThey had said that they had apologised to the Lieutenant Governor and who had accepted their apology.\nSenior Advocates Jayant Mehta, Kirti Uppal and Sonia Mathur along with advocates Ripu Daman Bhardwaj, Satya Ranjan Swain, Vijay Kumar Joshi, Himanshu Bidhuri, Kangan Roda, Nikita Sethi, Chetanya Puri, Priyanka Garg, Nikhil Jaiswal, Kamal Digpaul, Soumava Karmakar and Rudra Paliwal appeared for MLAs Vijender Gupta, Ajay Kumar Mahawar and Anil Kumar Bajpai. \nSenior Advocates Malvika Trivedi and Dinesh Agnani along with advocates Himanshu Pathak, Neeraj, Amit Tiwari, Sahaj Garg, Abhishek Saket, Shrey Sherawat, Kautilya Birat, Shoumendu Mukherjee, Kushagra Kansal, Siddharth Khatana, Subhash Tanwar, Ankush Kapoor and Shrey Sherawat appeared for MLAs Om Prakash Sharma, Jitender Mahajan and Mohan Singh Bisht.\nAdvocates Pavan Narang, Jyoti Taneja, Piyush Beriwal, Himanshu Sethi and Aiswarya Chhabra represented MLA Abhay Verma. \nThe Delhi Assembly was represented by Senior Advocate Sudhir Nandrajog as well as Delhi government's Additional Standing Counsel Sameer Vashisht and advocates Vanshay Kaul, Aman Singh and Vedansh Vashisht."}

This state of affairs at the CBSE is nothing but worrisome. Manifest arbitrariness at such a large scale cannot be allowed to go on unfettered.

{"ID": "id_1051", "Summary": "The Karnataka High Court recently held that work from home benefit after exhausting maternity leave, can be granted to a woman employee only if the nature of the work assigned to such employee makes it possible to do her official job from home [Prachi Sen v. Ministry of Defence and Ors]\nJustice R Devdas stated the same while denying relief of childcare leave to a woman employee at the Semiconductor Technology and Applied Research Centre (STARC), a unit under the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO).\n\"Though reference is made to Section 5(5) of the (Maternity Benefits Act), Act, 1961, it is evident from the said provision that maternity benefits such as work from home after availing the maternity benefit could be given only in case where the nature of work assigned to the women is such that it is possible for her to work from home... \nThe employees working with the fourth respondent-organisation are involved in research work which is both sensitive as well as complicated. Sensitive, in the nature of the work done, in the sense that the research is for the benefit of the Government of India which uses the facility in the defense fields and the research work will not be divulged to the public. This itself would prove that the nature of the work assigned to the petitioner cannot be carried on from home,\" the Court said. \nThe Court, however, noted that that creche facilities would be made available for her in the adjacent premises, and that the respondent-organisation should consider her representation for regularisation with sympathy. \nIn the present case, the petitioner had been working in the said position as a Senior Executive Engineer at the said centre for eight years.\nIn August 2020, she delivered a baby girl and availed of maternity leave until February. Thereafter, she used personal leave until April 2021. She contended that during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, she along with other employees were given the benefit to work from home.\nShe approached the Court seeking sanction for childcare leave, regularisation of her salary and release of her withheld salary.\nThe respondent-organisation contended that when the petitioner did not join duty after her sanctioned leave was exhausted, a communication was sent to her stating that she was staying away from work without leave, which would be treated as an unauthorised absence.\nShe would not be entitled to a salary for that period and was informed that disciplinary action would be initiated.\nThe petitioner responded by pointing out the benefits required to be provided under the Maternity Benefits Act, and two official memoranda issued by the Ministry of Personnel of the Government of India, which provides for grant of childcare leave to women employees with children below the age of 18. \nThe petitioner then approached the Central Administrative Tribunal in Bengaluru seeking similar relief. STARC sent her another communication noting that her application had been withdrawn, and called upon her to join her duties immediately and regularise the absence from May 2021. \nIt was argued before the Court on behalf of the petitioner that the Maternity Benefits Act is applicable to her, as an employee of STARC, a fully-funded organisation controlled by the Government of India. Leave benefits that are available to the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), are also made applicable to employees of STARC. Section 5(5) (right to payment of maternity benefit- where nature of work is such that she may work from home) should have been made available to her.\nIt was contended that notifications have been issued by the Central government directing all public sector undertakings to ensure that as far as possible provisions should be made for lactating mothers to work from home, in view of the COVID-19 pandemic. \nThe petitioner argued that in terms of the directions of the Government of India, it is the duty of the respondent-organisation to provide for child care leave and to permit the petitioner to work from home, until it is declared by the Central or State government that there is no need for employees to work from home. \nOn the other hand, the respondent argued that the benefits under the Maternity Benefits Act had already been provided to the petitioner. In respect of childcare leave, STARC had considered the request of female employees, to provide crèche and daycare facilities as per the Maternity Benefits Act. However, it was decided that it was not advisable due to sensitive processes at the workplace involving usage of chemicals and toxic gas. \nThe DRDO submitted that no requests had been made for a crèche facility within the premises, however, an arrangement has been made at the adjacent ITI complex, which can be made available for the petitioner's child. \nMoreover, the respondent organisation cannot be equated to the Government of India. The facilities made to Central government employees, whether it be providing maternity leave, childcare leave, and other facilities cannot be automatically adopted to STARC, the respondent argued. \nIt was contended that the Department of Personnel and Training, (DoPT), Government of India, has clarified that the orders issued by them are not automatically applicable to employees of Central public sector undertakings/ autonomous bodies, banks, etc, and it is for the PSUs to decide the applicability of rules or instructions issued for Central government employees to theirs. \nConsequently, the DRDO decided not to implement childcare leave for its employees at its units and foundries involved in production and implementation, since it would affect production schedules and timelines. \nThe High Court, while considering the matter, noted that Section 5(5) of the Maternity Benefits Act, which provides for work from home, can be given only in cases where the nature of the work assigned to women is such that it is possible for her to work at home. \nIn this case, the respondent-organisation had concluded that their premises are sensitive and there is risk involved due to usage of chemicals and toxic gases. The employees working at STARC are involved in research work that is sensitive as well as complicated. The research is for the benefit of the Government of India that uses the facility in the defence fields and the research cannot be divulged to the public. \nThis itself proved that the nature of work assigned to the petitioner cannot be carried from home, the Court noted. Even during the lockdown period, top officials had been functioning from the premises of the respondent-organisation, the single-judge noted. \nThe Court observed that it was clear that there is no specific provision of law or rules that mandate the respondent-organisation to grant childcare leave facility available to Central Government employees to employees of STARC. \nIt was noted that the respondent-organisation had warned the petitioner about unauthorised absence and the consequences of willful disobedience.\nThe Court accordingly observed that it could not lose sight of the fact that during the period of delivery and post delivery there were two serious waves of the COVID-19 pandemic, and a third wave after that. \nTherefore, if the petitioner was unable to join her duties, the respondent-organisation is required to have a sympathetic view to her, and the petitioner has pleaded that she is ready and willing to join duties, if childcare facilities are provided for her new born. \nUpon a submission by the respondent-organisation that another woman employee also availed of maternity leave similar to the petitioner but joined duty after that, the Court observed that in such cases parity cannot be drawn, as the difficulties of a mother are different in each case. \nThe Court concluded that the relief of child care leave for the petitioner cannot be granted, however, she was at liberty to make fresh representations regarding the unauthorised absence and seek regularisation. After she joins duty, the respondent-organisation must consider her representations sympathetically, it was ruled. \nAdvocate Beena PK represented the petitioner, and Central Government Counsel Jayakara Shetty represented the respondents."}
{"ID": "id_1052", "Summary": "The Nagpur bench of the Bombay High Court on Tuesday acquitted former Delhi University professor GN Saibaba and five other accused in an alleged Maoist links case. \nA bench of Justices Vinay Joshi and Valmiki SA Menezes set aside the verdict of a sessions court which had convicted Saibaba and others in 2017.\nThe Court said that the accused can be released from prison upon deposit of ₹50,000 each as bail bonds till the Supreme Court decides State's appeal.\nPertinently, the State did not ask for a stay on the judgment.\nThe bench delivered the verdict after rehearing the appeal by Saibaba after an earlier bench of the High Court too had acquitted the disabled professor on October 14, 2022.\nThe rehearing happened after the Supreme Court set aside the October 2022 acquittal order and remanded the matter back to the High Court for fresh hearing. \nSaibaba (54), is wheelchair-bound and 99 percent disabled. He is presently lodged in Nagpur Central Jail. \nA sessions court in Gadchiroli had, in March 2017, convicted Saibaba and the others for alleged Maoist links and for indulging in activities amounting to waging war against the country.\nThe sessions court had held that Saibaba and two other accused were in possession of naxal literature with the intent and purpose of circulation amongst underground naxlites at Gadchiroli and residents of the district with the aim to incite the people to resort to violence.\nFurther, the sessions court had negated the submission that the absence of sanction to prosecute Saibaba was fatal to the case of the prosecution.\nSaibaba then moved the Bombay High Court against the sessions court order and the same was heard by a bench led by Justice Rohit B Deo.\nThat bench had on October 14, 2022, a Friday, allowed the appeal and acquitted Saibaba.\nThat appeal was allowed based on the fact that the sessions court framed charges against Saibaba in the absence of sanction from the Central government as per Section 45(1) of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA).\nThe High Court had recorded that while terrorism poses an ominous threat to national security and every legitimate weapon in the armoury must be deployed against it, a civil democracy cannot sacrifice procedural safeguards afforded to the accused.\nThe Maharashtra government immediately approached the Supreme Court against the same. \nThe top court subsequently held a special sitting on October 15, 2022 (a Saturday) and suspended the High Court's decision.\nThe order was passed by a bench of Justices MR Shah and Bela M Trivedi after the Maharashtra government contended that failure to grant sanction cannot lead to acquittal in view of Section 465 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.\nSubsequently, after a lengthy hearing, a bench of the top court comprising Justices MR Shah and CT Ravikumar on April 19, 2023, set aside the High Court acquittal judgment and remanded the matter to the High Court for fresh consideration.\nIt then came to be heard by Justices Joshi and Menezes. \nInterestingly, Justice Rohit Deo of the High Court who had acquitted Saibaba, resigned as High Court judge on August 2, 2023\nSenior advocate SP Dharmadhikari with advocate Nihalsingh Rathod appeared for GN Saibaba. \nSenior advocate Trideep Pais with advocates Pradeep Mandhyan, Barunkumar and HP Lingayat appeared for the remaining accused. \nSenior advocate Abad Ponda with advocates HS Chitale, Jugal Kanani, and PK Sathinathan appeared for Maharashtra government."}

This scheme being a concession, is to be implemented scrupulously in accordance with the terms and conditions stipulated. This scheme being violative of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India, is to be restricted, so as to ensure that the appointments are made on compassionate ground only for deserving cases,\" the Court said.\nAs per the petitioner, her mother worked as a junior assistant in a government-run school in Vellore district. Her mother too was appointed on compassionate grounds after her father died. \nThe petitioner was adopted by the mother a few months before she died on May 8, 2002.\nHowever, the petitioner did not apply for compassionate appointment within the mandatory three years time period and only filed an application for the same in 2014. The said application was rejected on the ground of delay.\nConsidering the facts of the case, Justice Subramaniam observed that the very purpose of the scheme is to mitigate the circumstances arising on account of the sudden death of a government employee.\n\"Thus, the lapse of time is also a ground to draw a factual inference that the penurious circumstances aroused on account of the sudden death became vanished. Thus, the scheme of compassionate appointment cannot be extended beyond the reasonable period, more so, after a lapse of several years,\" the judge opined.\nThe Court further said that this scheme has been streamlined by the government, so as to provide appointment only on genuine grounds. \n\"Even if any one of the legal heirs are employed in government service or in private service and an earning member, then the family of the deceased employee is not eligible for the compassionate appointment,\" it added.\nIn view of the same, the bench dismissed the petition.\nAdvocate S Arunkumar appeared for the petitioner.\nGovernment Advocate AM Ayyadurai represented the State."}

The respondent authorities received a complaint in the year 1996, stating that the appellant was a deserter from the Army and he was declared an absconder after he deserted the armed forces in 1992.\nThis was confirmed by the Station House Officer, Inderpuri, who also confirmed the fact that he had not disclosed the same in a form filled by him. The respondent authorities, therefore, terminated the appellant's services during the probation period.\nThis was challenged by the appellant. \nHe argued that he was not given any opportunity to present his version and the order terminating his service was passed by conducting an enquiry behind his back. \nAt the outset, the Supreme Court noted that the order of termination of employment of the appellant was only a termination simpliciter (simply and unconditionally) and was well within the powers enshrined under Rule 5 of the Central Civil Services (Temporary Service) Rules of 196.\n\"During the period of probation, it is always open to the employer to verify the antecedents of a temporary appointee, in case any information is received by way of complaint or otherwise. Merely because the antecedents were verified by addressing a letter to the SHO/Inderpuri, it cannot be said that respondents have conducted regular inquiry, so as to give an opportunity to the appellant. In absence of any allegation in the impugned order, the order of termination dated 14.08.1996 cannot be said to be an order casting stigma on the appellant,\" the Court observed.\nThe Court relied upon its decision in Avatar Singh v. Union of India and Others, wherein it was observed that once verification form requires certain information to be furnished, the declarant is duty bound to furnish it correctly and any suppression of material facts can be ground for termination of service.\nThe Court, therefore, rejected the appeal noting that \"before the declaration of probation, on the ground that the appellant has not disclosed particulars of earlier employment, it is always open for the respondents to terminate his temporary service without issuing any notice.\"\nAdvocate Anshu Mahajan argued for the appellant.

State of Uttarakhand].\nA Division Bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Rajesh Bindal held,\n\"Mere death of the deceased being unnatural in the matrimonial home within seven years of marriage will not be sufficient to convict the accused under Section 304B and 498A IPC.\"\nThe Court, therefore, acquitted a man who was convicted under Sections 304B (dowry death), 498A (cruelty by husband or relatives) and 201 (causing disappearance of evidence) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) for the death of his wife within two years of marriage.\nThe Court was hearing the husband's appeal against a decision of the Uttarakhand High Court which had upheld the trial court's conviction.\nThe wife died two years into the marriage while she was residing in her matrimonial home. On June 24, 1995, the father of deceased registered a complaint against the husband of deceased and the in-laws for the murder of his daughter.\nThe first information report (FIR) filed in this regard stated that the deceased was killed on account of non-fulfilment of her in-laws' demands of a motorbike and land as dowry.\nThe father of the deceased also stated that a day before her death, she was beaten up and subsequently strangulated to death by her husband and in-laws. It was further alleged that the accused had cremated the dead body of the deceased without informing her parents.\nThe trial court convicted the husband, brother-in-law and mother-in-law of the deceased for the aforesaid offences. However, on appeal, the High Court acquitted the brother-in-law and mother-in-law, and upheld the conviction of the husband alone. Further, the sentence of rigorous imprisonment of ten years awarded to the appellant husband under Section 304B IPC, was reduced to seven years.\nThe husband challenged this verdict before the apex court.\nThe Court noted that since the conviction of the appellant-husband was under Sections 304B and 498A IPC, there exists a presumption under Section 113B of the Indian Evidence Act 1872, regarding dowry death of the deceased within seven years of marriage.\nIn this regard, the Court noted that for an offence of dowry death, the deceased has to be subjected to cruelty or harassment soon before the death. However, while analysing the statement of the father of the deceased, the Court noted that apart from instances of dowry demands in the initial months of marriage, there was nothing in the statement to show that any such demand was raised immediately before her death.\nAdditionally, the Court observed,\n\"None of the witnesses stated about the cruelty or harassment to the deceased by the appellant or any of his family members on account of demand of dowry soon before the death or otherwise. Rather harassment has not been narrated by anyone. It is only certain oral averments regarding demand of motorcycle and land which is also much prior to the incident.\"\nTherefore, the Court was of the view that evidence led by the prosecution does not fulfil the pre-requisites to invoke the presumption under Section 304B IPC or Section 113-B of Indian Evidence Act 1872. More so, since there is no evidence of cruelty, the conviction under Section 498-A cannot be sustained.\nAccordingly, the Court has acquitted the appellant-husband.\nAdvocate Shubhranshu Padhi assisted the Court as amicus curiae."}

{"ID": "id_1077", "Summary": "Courts should be sensitive when the poor and deprived knock at its doors for justice, the Delhi High Court observed on Monday while directing the Central government to provide an alternative plot of land to five slum dwellers whose houses were demolished more than 14 years ago by the Indian Railways for expansion of New Delhi Railway Station\nJustice C Hari Shankar said that this allotment would be subject to them providing documents to prove that they were residing in the slum around the station before November 30, 1998 – the cutoff date for entitlement under the relocation policy – and that they continued to reside in jhuggis even today.\n\"When the poor and deprived knock at the doors of the Court, the Court is required to be sensitive and sensitised in equal measure. The Court is required to remain alive to the fact that such litigants do not have access to exhaustive legal resources,\" the Court observed. \nIt further said that slum dwellers do not stay in slums out of choice. \n\"Their choice of residence is a last ditch effort at securing, for themselves, what the Constitution regards as an inalienable adjunct to the right to life under Article 21, viz. the right to shelter and a roof over their heads. As to whether the roof provides any shelter at all is, of course, another matter altogether,” the judgment said. \nJustice Hari Shankar was dealing with a petition by five people claiming that they were residents of a Shahid Basti slum cluster near the New Delhi Railway Station since 1980s.\nIn 2002-2003 as the Indian Railways was seeking to convert New Delhi Railway Station into a “world-class” railway station and to increase the number of platforms, they planned to acquire the slum land.\nThe petitioners, therefore, relocated to the other side of the tracks situated at Lahori Gate and set up a slum colony there. The name of the colony remained Shahid Basti.\nHowever, further modernisation of the station required the authorities to clear that area around Lahori Gate as well for which the slum there was demolished on June 14, 2008.\nIt was argued by the petitioners that under the Policy of Relocation of Slum Dwellers, their eviction could not have been undertaken without a prior survey.\nThe railways argued that the relocation policy envisaged relocation only of residents of slums which had been set up on or before November 30, 1998 and the petitioners’ houses at Lahori Gate had been set up only in 2003.\nThe requirement of conducting survey applies only to eligible slum clusters which were there before the cut-off date, the Railways said.\nHowever, the Court held that paragraph six of the policy, which provides the cut-off date and eligibility criteria for relocation has to be read as a whole.\nThe judge said that the governing consideration in the minds of the framers of the policy was the length of jhuggi stay effectively meaning that if a dweller could establish that prior to the cut-off date he was living in a slum in Delhi, he would be regarded a beneficiary.\nThat he may have shifted to some other slum cannot be a hindrance to this entitlement, the Court made it clear.\n\"Having themselves compelled the petitioners to set up a new jhuggi in 2003, the Railways cannot use that date as the basis to deny, to the petitioners, their right to relocation, even though they were residing in jhuggis elsewhere prior to the cut off date of 30th November 1998. This would be contrary to every known tenet of propriety and fair play,” Justice Hari Shankar further stated.\nTherefore, the Court concluded,\n“If the petitioners have been residents of the Shahid Basti jhuggi in Nabi Karim, prior to November 30, 1998, they would be entitled to the benefit of the Relocation Policy, even if the jhuggi at the Lahori Gate site, from which they were removed, came up only in 2003.”\nCourt’s observations on homeless and slum dwellers\nIn his 32-page judgement, Justice Hari Shankar said that when the poor and deprived knock at the doors of the Court, it is required to be sensitive, sensitised and alive to the fact that these litigants do not have access to exhaustive legal resources.\n“As one of the three coequal wings of the government, albeit functioning independent of, and uninfluenced by, the other two, the judiciary is required to remain as sensitive to the call of Articles 38 and 39 as the legislature, or the executive. Law, with all its legalese, is worth tinsel, if the underprivileged cannot get justice,” the judgment said.\nAt the end of the day, our preambular goal is not law, but justice, he underscored. \n“At the end of the day, our preambular goal is not law, but justice. Law is but the instrument, the via media, as it were, to attain the ultimate goal of justice, and law which cannot aspire to justice is, therefore, not worth administering.”\nJustice Hari Shankar further said that the homeless, who live on pavements and inaccessible nooks and crannies of the city, do not live but merely exist. \nLife, as envisaged under Article 21 of the Constitution is unknown to them, he lamented.\n“Even a bare attempt at imagining how they live is, for us, peering out from our gilt-edged cocoons, cathartic. And so we prefer not to do so; as a result, these denizens of the dark continue to eke out their existence, not day by day, but often hour by hour, if not minute by minute,” he stated. \nThe court said that alleviation of the plight of the poor and homeless is subsumed in each of these directive principles which, though they are not enforceable by Court, are nonetheless fundamental in the governance of the country, and mandatorily required to be borne in mind by the State while making laws.\n“Every statutory instrument, be it plenary or subordinate, is required to be so interpreted as to render it constitutional, rather than unconstitutional. Juxtaposed, these principles require all statutes, and instruments of state policy, to be interpreted in a manner which would harmonize with the directive principles of state policy, contained in Chapter IIIA of the Constitution of India,” the Court opined. \nAdvocates NS Dalal, Rachana Dalal and Alok Kumar appeared for the petitioners.\nAdvocate Parvinder Chauhan and Sushil Dixit appeared for DUSIB.\nAdvocate Geetanjali Mohan appeared for the railways."}

Anyone who kills cows or allows others to kill them is deemed to rot in hell as many years as there are hairs upon his body. Likewise, the bull is depicted as a vehicle of Lord Shiva: a symbol of respect for the male cattle,\" the Court said.\nThe single-judge further underscored that since we are in a secular country, we should respect all religions including Hinduism and the cow is considered the most sacred of all the animals in Hinduism.\n\"We are living in a secular country and must have respect for all religions and in Hinduism, the belief and faith is that cow is representative of divine and natural beneficence and should therefore be protected and venerated,\" the Court observed. \nIn the late 19th and 20th century, in India, a movement to protect cows arose that strove to unify the citizens by demanding that the Government of India ban cow slaughter with immediate effect, the Court said.\n\"This Court also hope and trust that the Central Government may take appropriate decision to ban cow slaughtering in the country and to declare the same as 'protected national animal',\" added the Bench.\nThe order was passed in a plea filed by one Mohd.

He does not want to argue anymore,” the Court observed before proceeding to decide the matter on merits.\nConcluding that even an attempt to scandalize or lower the authority of a court would fall under the definition of criminal contempt, the bench found Shrivastava guilty in four cases although it dropped charges in three other cases.\nTaking note of the lack of apology by the lawyer, the Court proceeded to punish him with a fine of ₹4 lakh. \n“The respondent-contemnor is directed to deposit the fine of Rs.4,00,000/- (Rs.1,00,000/- each on complaints dated 25.07.2011, 21.08.2012, 24.08.2012 and 25.09.2012) with the M.P. High Court Bar Association within a period of one month from the date of the pronouncement of this order,\" the bench directed.\nIn case of failure to deposit the amount, the Court said that Shrivastava would have to suffer jail time for one month each for each complaint against him.\nAdvocate Pushpendra Yadav appeared as amicus curiae. Manoj Kumar Shrivastava appeared in person."}
{"ID": "id_1087", "Summary": "The Kerala High Court recently urged courts to carefully analyse case under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act while considering pleas for anticipatory bail, in order to rule out the possibility of false implication. \nJustice A Badhurudeen said it was a shocking fact that many innocent persons are victims of false implications and, therefore, courts must pay great attention to the details when it comes to cases under the SC/ST Act.\n\"It is shocking, rather a mind blowing fact that many innocent persons are victims of false implication under the SC/ST (POA) Act. Therefore, it is the need of the hour for the courts to segregate the grain from the chaff by analysing the genesis of the case, the antecedents prior to registration of the crime, with reference to existence of animosity between the complainant and the accused, with particular attention, vis-a-vis previous disputes/cases/ complaints, etc. while considering the question of prima facie case, when considering plea for pre-arrest bail,\" the Court said in its judgment.\nThe judge said that it cannot be disputed that the stringent provisions of the SC/ST Act have been incorporated to curb the menace of atrocities against members of SC/ST communities. However, it is because of the stringent provisions in the matter of grant of anticipatory bail that the Court must go into the genesis of the cases to rule out the possibility of ulterior motives in filing complaints under the Act. \n\".... in such cases, the court could very well hold that prima facie, the prosecution allegations could not be believed for the purpose of denying anticipatory bail, after leaving the question as to commission of offence/offences for a detailed and fair investigation by the Investigating Officer. Indubitably, such a course of action is necessary to rule out the possibility of false implication,\" the order stated.\nThe Court made these observations while considering an appeal moved by a woman against the order of a Special Judge under the SC/ST (POA) Act that refused to grant her anticipatory bail in a crime alleging commission of offence punishable under Section 3(1)(s) of the SC/ST (POA) Act,\nThe allegation against the appellant, was that when the complainant went to the bank where she was an employee, she called him out by his caste name in public view. The appellant does not belong to any SC/ST whereas the complainant does. \nBefore the High Court, the appellant pointed out that the complainant's wife worked with the man against whom she had registered a police complaint for repeated sexual harassment. The registration of the present crime was only one among many attempts they had made to force her to withdraw her sexual harassment complaint, the appellant argued.\nThe Court noted that even though there is a bar under Section 18 and 18A of the SC/ST (POA) Act to grant anticipatory bail, it has been settled by the Supreme Court in Prathvi Raj Chauhan v. Union of India & Ors. that in cases where there is no prima facie case, grant of anticipatory bail is not specifically barred.\nIn the present case, the Court opined that the case advanced by the defacto complainant was prima facie doubtful and, therefore, granted anticipatory bail.\nThe Court did, however, direct the appellant to cooperate with the investigation and make herself available for interrogation as and when directed by the investigating officer."}

Umar Gautam v. State of UP).\nGautam was arrested by the Anti Terrorist Squad (ATS) in connection with an alleged conversion racket.\nA Division Bench of Justices Ramesh Sinha and Vikas Srivastava rejected the plea, stating that the press release issued by the investigation agencies and media outlets does not hinder a fair trial.\n\"The assertion of the petitioner that by means of press note dated 20.06.2021, some sensitive information has been leaked in the ongoing investigation against the petitioner is patently erroneous and is, accordingly, rejected,\" the Court said.\nThe Court said that there is no material indicating that any sensitive material(s) in respect of the FIR registered against Gautam were publicised by the investigating authorities. \nAfter reviewing the material placed on record and the submissions of the parties, the Court found that the press note released by the investigating authorities on June 20 only indicates the reason for lodging the FIR and names of arrested persons with their photos.\nIn this regard, the Court placed reliance on the office memorandum issued by the Union Ministry of Home Affairs which laid down guidelines to be scrupulously adhered to by the police while dealing with the media. \nThe said guidelines state that police officials should confine their briefings to the essential facts, and not rush to the press with half-baked, speculative or unconfirmed information about ongoing investigations.\nCounsel for the petitioner had placed reliance on Devangana Kalita v. Delhi Police, where the Delhi Police disclosed sensitive information with regard to petitioner via press release which further led to a malicious media trial.\nHowever, the plea was dismissed by the Court.\nThe petitioners are accused of mass conversion of around 1,000 persons and have been charged for offences under the recently enacted Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Act, 2021.\nPreviously, the Court demanded how such an order can be passed and also referred to a judgment of Supreme Court judge Justice DY Chandrachud on media freedom.\n\"Can we stop the media?

{"ID": "id_1092", "Summary": "The Supreme Court recently set aside the conviction of a husband booked for abetting the suicide of his wife in 1993 [Naresh Kumar vs State of Haryana].\nWhile doing so, the bench of Justices JB Pardiwala and Manoj Misra sounded a note of anguish about the long ordeal faced by the accused.\n\"The criminal justice system of ours can itself be a punishment. It is exactly what has happened in this case. It did not take more than 10 minutes for this Court to reach to an inevitable conclusion that the conviction of the appellant convict for the offence punishable under Section 306 of the IPC is not sustainable in law. The ordeal for the appellant started some time in 1993 and is coming to the end in 2024, i.e. almost after a period of 30 years of suffering\", the bench observed.\nThe top court noted that it was mindful of the fact that a young woman died leaving behind her 6-month-old infant and that no crime should go unpunished.\n\"But at the same time, the guilt of the accused has to be determined in accordance with law,\" the Court added.\nThe observations came while allowing an appeal filed by the accused-husband against a Punjab and Haryana High Court order passed in 2008. The husband had been accused of harassing his wife and driving her to die by suicide in November 1993. \nA trial court convicted the husband in 1998, and the High Court later upheld the trial court's decision to convict the husband under Section 306 (abetment of suicide) of the Indian Penal Code. This verdict was challenged before the Supreme Court. \nThe apex court noted that the mere alleged harassment of the deceased woman at the hands of the accused husband is not enough to constitute guilt for abetment of suicide.\n“It also requires an active act or direct act which led the deceased to commit suicide. The ingredient of mens rea cannot be assumed to be ostensibly present but has to be visible and conspicuous,\" the Court explained.\nThe instant case lacked clinching evidence to convict the husband, the Court concluded.\nPertinently, the bench underscored that the mere fact that the deceased died by suicide within seven years of marriage will not make the presumption under Section 113A (presumption as to abetment of suicide by a married woman) of the Indian Evidence Act apply automatically. \nRather, courts have to be very careful and vigilant in assessing evidence of alleged cruelty in such cases which can be a tough and arduous task, the bench added. \n“Before the presumption under Section 113A is raised, the prosecution must show evidence of cruelty or incessant harassment in that regard ... If it transpires that a victim committing suicide was hyper sensitive to ordinary petulance, discord and differences in domestic life quite common to the society to which the victim belonged and such petulance, discord and differences were not expected to induce a similarly circumstanced individual in a given society to commit suicide, the conscience of the Court would not be satisfied for holding that the accused charged of abetting the offence of suicide was guilty,” the Supreme Court made it clear.\nThe appeal against the accused man's conviction was, therefore, allowed and he was acquitted of the crime. \nAdvocates SD Singh, Shweta Sinha, Ram Kripal Singh, Siddharth Singh and Aparna Jha appeared for the husband, one Naresh Kumar.\nAdditional Advocate General Raj Singh Rana and advocates Samar Vijay Singh, Keshav Mittal, Sabarni Som and Fateh Singh appeared for the Haryana government."}

Further, Section 11 of 1958 Act provides that an order under this Act may be made by any court empowered to try and sentence the offender to imprisonment and also by the High Court or any other court when the case comes before it on appeal or in revision. Thus, this Court under the 1958 Act itself can pass an order at this stage,\" the Court held.\nThe Court was hearing a petition filed by one Kunti Kumari challenging her conviction under Section 504 (intentional insult) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). She urged the bench to extend the benefit of the provisions contained in the Probation of Offenders Act,1958, which allows releasing offenders on probation or after due admonition.\nAs per the prosecution case, the complainant belonged to the Santhal tribe and was the president of the education committee of the Kora Para village. On December 18, 2007, the committee along with teachers and other members were to assemble for a budget meeting.\nDuring the meeting, Kunti allegedly snatched meals packet from the complainant and hurled casteist abuses at her. She went on the state that the complainant belonged to a caste that relishes pig and cow meat and that even a dog will not eat the food that she distributes.\nThe appellant was convicted under Section 504 IPC and Section 3(i)(x) of the SC/ST Act by the trial court by a judgment dated August 28, 2010 and was sentenced to four months simple imprisonment under Section 504 IPC and six months simple imprisonment under Section 3(i)(x) of the SC/ST Act.\nThe criminal appeal filed by the appellant was partly allowed by the Jharkhand High Court which, by its judgment dated December 9, 2016, set aside the conviction and sentence under Section 3(i)(x) of the SC/ST Act. It, however, upheld the conviction under Section 504 IPC and reduced the sentence to 15 days simple imprisonment.\nThe Supreme Court refused to interfere with the finding of conviction. \nHowever, as regards the sentence, the apex court noted that Section 3 of the Probation of Offenders Act confers power upon the court to release certain offenders after admonition when a person is guilty of having committed an offence punishable with imprisonment for not more than two years, or with fine, or with both, under the Indian Penal Code or any other law, and there is no previous conviction proved against such offender.\n\"Section 3 of the 1958 Act confers power upon the court to release certain offenders after admonition when a person is found guilty of having committed an offence punishable under Section 379 or Section 380 or Section 381 or Section 404 or Section 420 of the IPC or any offence punishable with imprisonment for not more than two years, or with fine, or with both, under the IPC or any other law, and there is no previous conviction proved against such offender,\" the judgment noted.\nIn the present case, the conviction was under Section 504 IPC where the maximum sentence provided is two years and there was no previous conviction of the appellant, the Bench noted. \nThe Court, therefore, directed that the appellant be released after admonition. \n\"Considering the facts of the case, we deem it appropriate that the appellant may be released instead of carrying out the sentence after due admonition. Accordingly, agreeing with the conviction under Section 504 IPC, the appellant is directed to be released after admonition,\" the Court ordered."}

The manner in which offence was committed and also the magnitude of crime, in our view, places the present matter in the category of anti-social or socially abhorrent nature of crime. We concur with the finding of Trial Court that six persons were murdered by Sarvan in most brutal, grotesque, diabolical and dastardly manner arousing indignation and abhorrence of society which calls for an exemplary punishment,\" the Court said in its 96-page judgement.\nThe bench noted that on April 25, 2009, when the appellant's now deceased wife objected to his illicit relationship, he came out of the house, got an axe and went back inside, shouting that he would finish off his wife and sons. \nAfter some time, when the neighbouring woman heard screams of the wife and tried to intervene, the appellant attacked her too mounting multiple blows. When the neighbouring women's son and daughter tried to save their mother, he did not spare them too.\nThe appellant's wife was 35 years at the time of incident, while her three sons were aged 6, a and 1.5 years. The neighbouring woman was 50 years old and her son was 10 years old, the bench noted.\n\"Three minor children including their mother and two of his neighbours have been murdered by Sarvan when they were helpless and nothing is on record to show that they aggravated the situation so as to arise sudden and grave passion on his part to commit such dastardly crime. He has also not shown any remorse or repentance at any point of time, inasmuch as, he attempted to hide the weapon in the house of his bhabhi (co-accused),\" the bench observed.\nThe bench further noted that in his statements recorded by the trial court under section 313 of the CrPC, the appellant didn't express any remorse but confessed to his illicit relationship and that he was unhappy with his wife for objecting to it.\n\"The conduct, attitude and manner in which murder of four persons of his family and two persons of his neighbours was committed by Sarvan shows that he is a menace to the society and if he is not awarded death penalty, others members of the Society may not be safe. He slayed six lives to quench his thirst. The entire incident is extremely revolting and shocks the collective conscience of the community. Murders were committed in gruesome, merciless and brutal manner,\" the bench opined while categorising this case as a rarest of rare one.\nFurther the judges said that the aggravating circumstances in this case were on a higher pedestal in comparison to the mitigating circumstances. It noted that there wasn't any report regarding any chance of his rehabilitation and reformation.\n\"In our view, the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating circumstances by all canons of logic and punishment of life imprisonment would neither serve the ends of justice nor will be an appropriate punishment. We are also clearly of the view that he is a menace to the society and there is no chance of his rehabilitation or reformation and no leniency in imposing punishment is called for,\" the Court concluded.\nTherefore, it upheld his conviction for murder and attempt to destroy evidence and also upheld the death sentence. It also upheld the conviction of his sister-in-law, who helped him to destroy evidence.\nAdvocates Manjusha Kapil and Kamlesh Singh represented Sarvan and Suman respectively."}
{"ID": "id_1097", "Summary": "The Supreme Court on Friday upheld the interview criteria followed by High Courts and the Supreme Court for designating lawyers as Senior Advocates but reduced the points given for the number of publication as a criterion [Indira Jaising v. Supreme Court of India].\nA bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul, Ahsanuddin Amanullah and Aravind Kumar also ruled that voting by judges for conferring the gown should not be by secret ballot except in exceptional circumstances.\n\"We have upheld interview criteria as it would enable more holistic assessment. We have sought to make it workable and thus kept it at a streamlined number in context of number of candidates. We are not reducing the marks in this category,\" the Court said.\nOn voting by secret ballot, the Court said the following: \n\"We have set forth the different aspects on which we were urged. First is voting by secret ballot - we have said in view of permanent committee it would serve no purpose. It has resulted in exclusion of names from final lists. It is an honour to be conferred. Comments by a judge can have deleterious effects, voting by secret ballot has to be exception not rule, with reasons stated. It will be difficult to assign cutoffs,\" the order said. \nThe Court said 15 points for publications was too high, and reduced the same to 5. \n\"Most practicing advocates find very little time to write academic articles. In any case, academic publications require a different aptitude. However, given that Senior Advocates are expected to make nuanced and sophisticated submissions, academic knowledge of the law is an important prerequisite. We believe that confining these criteria merely to the authorship of academic articles would not be enough.\"\nThe Court said that academic research and writing ability can be considered by the committee concerned.\n\"Senior Counsel have a duty to leading and be an example to the rest of the Bar, especially younger members. They are also required to contribute to academic teaching, writing, and research, and to the process of continuing legal education,\" the Court said.\nPertinently, the Court said that the exercise of designating Seniors should be carried out at least once a year by the High Courts and the Supreme Court.\n\"The exercise should be carried out at least once a year.

All applications for designation would go to the Permanent Committee comprising the Chief Justice, two senior most judges, the Attorney General/Advocate General and an eminent member of the bar nominated by the other four members.\nThe Bench had noted on February 16 that there may be different issues in different High Courts, before adding that the issues arising out of the judgment's concluding paragraph would be taken up first.\nThe paragraph in question leaves it open for the existing mechanism to be 'revisited' based on experience.\nThe marks removed from the publication category were allotted to heads under reportable judgments, pro bono work and domain expertise. \nThe Court clarified that only reportable judgments and not orders would count, and pro bono and other work would have to be substantive rather than just a mere appearance.\nDue consideration must be given to the quality of synopses as well as diversification of work with respect to practice before tribunals, it was stated. \nPertinently, the Court said diversity must be encouraged particularly among women and first-generation lawyers.\n\"This would encourage meritorious advocates who will come into the field knowing that there is scope to rise to the top. The profession has seen a paradigm shift over a period of time, particularly with the advent of newer law schools such as National Law Universities.

Its vital organs, like the brain and lungs, are almost fully developed, preparing for life outside the womb,\" the Court added. \nNotably, the Court also observed that, in an unusual twist, the reports and records before the Court indicated that \"the victim child had not been forced\" by the rape accused. \n \"That said, no doubt, the child is still very young – just 13 to 14 years in age, and what happened to her is certainly statutory rape,\" the Court clarified. \nThe judge added these observations were only made with reference to the present case and must not be construed to favour the accused, who is facing proceedings under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (POCSO Act). \nThe judge proceeded to reject permission for the victim child's abortion since the pregnancy was at an advanced stage. \n\"This Court is saying as afore only for one reason, namely that the pregnancy is now very advanced, with the Medical Board speaking with unanimity that the “uterus corresponded to 30 weeks of gestation with good foetal heart.\" The foetus has, in fact, life with heart rate; and hence, termination of the pregnancy at this stage is impossible, as also untenable,\" the Court said. \nIn earlier hearings, the High Court had passed orders to medically examine and protect the victim.\nGovernment Pleader, advocate Vidya Kuriakose informed the Court that the victim child was now with her parents, having brought back from Children's Home where she had earlier been housed. \nAppearing for the girl's mother (petitioner), advocate M Kabani Dinesh argued that the child was entitled to terminate her pregnancy since her pregnancy was the outcome of rape.\nAlthough it expressing empathy for the petitioner's situation, especially considering the young age of the victim child, Justice Ramachandran denied the request to allow the abortion.\nHe concluded that the provisions of the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act cannot be invoked in this case to abort the pregnancy. However, the Court assured the petitioner that her daughter will receive legal protection.\nWith these observations, the Court closed the petition after directing the Child Protection Officer to provide regular support to the petitioner and her family. \nThe petitioner was represented by advocates M Kabani Dinesh and C Anchala.\nThe Central Government was represented by Deputy Solicitor General Manu S."}

In the said application, Pracha said that Prasad had threatened to implicate him (Pracha) in the case. Pracha added that he got a private investigation conducted which found out that the SPP was taking money in cash from the police.\nPrasad filed a response stating that Pracha has questioned his integrity and that he (Pracha) should produce evidence to substantiate his \"false and grave\" allegations. \nThe prosecution cannot be browbeaten like this, Prasad added.\nHe also said that Pracha cannot continue to represent the accused in the case because one of the protected witnesses, ‘Smith’, had mentioned Pracha.

{"ID": "id_1108", "Summary": "The Supreme Court on Thursday acquitted two persons on death row and a third person who was facing life imprisonment in a 10-year-old case involving the kidnapping and murder of a 15-year-old boy. [Rajesh and anr vs State of Madhya Pradesh]\nA bench of Justices BR Gavai, JB Pardiwala, and PV Sanjay Kumar strongly lamented about the disappointing police probe and prosecution in the case and called for the introduction of a police code of investigation to guide scientific investigations.\n\"We may note with deep and profound concern the disappointing standards of police investigation that seem to be the invariable norm ... It is high time, perhaps, that a consistent and dependable code of investigation is devised with a mandatory and detailed procedure for the police to implement and abide by during the course of their investigation so that the guilty do not walk free on technicalities, as they do in most cases in our country. We need say no more,\" the bench observed.\nThe bench was hearing appeals challenging a 2017 Madhya Pradesh High Court judgment.\nThe High Court had upheld the convictions and sentence of the three accused in the murder case. The trial court had convicted them in 2016.\nOn appeal, the top court noted that case was entirely hinged on circumstantial evidence as there was no eyewitness to the kidnapping and murder.\nThe Supreme Court added that there were 'cavernous gaps' and 'discrepancies galore' in the evidence and purported sequence of events. \nThe judges further commented that often, police are found to be overzealous in picking up those who they think are guilty and building a case against them, with scant regard for the due procedure. \nThe top court added that this only leads to gaping holes and weak links in the chain of evidence, as was the case in the present investigation. \nIn this case, the bench also noted that the police had erred in relying on a confession made while in police custody. Further, the panchnama and seizures memos were not prepared in accordance with the law, the judges found.\nThe failure of the police to examine of the owners of the SIM cards used to allegedly make ransom calls was also termed by the Supreme Court as a shocking lapse indicating a slipshod probe.\nAll of this led the Court to castigate the police for tailoring their investigation, showing complete indifference to procedure, and leaving important leads unchecked while glossing over others. \n\"(It) leaves us with no option but to extend the benefit of doubt to the appellants. The higher principle of ‘proof beyond reasonable doubt’ and more so, in a case built on circumstantial evidence, would have to prevail and be given priority,\" the Court held.\nThe Supreme Court was also perplexed on how the courts below went on to impose capital punishment ignoring the weak links and loopholes in the prosecution case.\n\"No valid and acceptable reasons were put forth as to why this case qualified as the ‘rarest of rare cases’, warranting such drastic punishment. Per contra, we find that the yawning infirmities and gaps in the chain of circumstantial evidence in this case warrant acquittal of the appellants by giving them the benefit of doubt. The degree of proof required to hold them guilty beyond reasonable doubt, on the strength of circumstantial evidence, is clearly not established,\" the Supreme Court said.\nThe appeals were, thus, allowed and the three accused were acquitted. \nSenior Advocate Sidharth Luthra with advocates Supriya Juneja, Bhavesh Seth, Pankaj Singhal, Aditya Singla, Shakti Singh, Ayush Agarwal, Udbhav Sinha, and Trisha Chandran represented the accused, Raja Yadav, Rajesh Yadav and Om Prakash Yadav.\nProject 39A - a criminal justice programme at National Law University Delhi that represents death row prisoners - briefed Luthra.\nAdvocate Pashupathi Nath Razdan appeared for the Madhya Pradesh government."}

It was pointed out that a close relative would naturally be present at the scene of the offence.\n“The evidence of such a witness cannot automatically be discarded by labelling the witness as interested,\" the Court opined. \nIn this regard, the fact that the incident took place at the victim’s residence, a place not ordinarily accessible by the public, was taken into account.\nWhile pointing out the difference between a related and interested witness, the Bench relied on the decision of the Supreme Court in Kartik Malhar v State of Bihar, wherein it was held that a close relative who was a natural witness could not be regarded as an interested witness, since the term “interested” suggested that the witness must have some interest in having the accused convicted.\nThe High Court observed that it found the testimony of the witnesses consistent and reliable and thus, rejected the appellant's contention that the testimony must be disbelieved simply because they were the victim’s close relatives.\nFurther, finding no weight in the appellant’s other contentions, it was concluded that the prosecution had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt. Therefore, the appeal was dismissed.\nAdvocate Abida Syed was the Amicus Curiae in the case while the respondent was represented by the additional government advocate."}

Union of India, a landmark decision on the rights of transgender persons.\nIt was pointed out that the top court in this case had held gender identity to be integral to the dignity of an individual and was at the core of personal autonomy and self-determination.\nHe also cited Section 15 of the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019, which covers healthcare services such as SRS and hormonal therapy.\nReference was also made to a recent decision of the Rajasthan High Court which permitted a physical training instructor to alter their name and gender in service records following a sex reassignment surgery.\nAfter hearing the arguments, the Court held that there was no justification for the DGP to withhold the application of the petitioner. Thus, the Court directed him to dispose of the pending application in light of the judgments referred to in the order.\nThe Court also directed the State government to file an appropriate affidavit as to whether it has framed any such Act in compliance with directions issued by the Supreme Court in the NALSA case.\n\"However, it is provided at the same time that any such Act or Rule if has not been famed till date, the State Government will ensure to frame such Act at par with the Central legislation,\" Justice Kumar added.\nThe matter will be heard next on September 21.\nAdvocates Ram Janam Shahi and Pramod Kumar Yadav represented the petitioner."}

His posts also led to resentment among people of nearby villages as well as mass demonstrations, the Court was told. \nTherefore, a first information report (FIR) was lodged under Section 295-A (hurting religious sentiments) of the Indian Penal Code against Akhtar. Later on, charges under Section 153A (promoting enmity) and 505(2) (public mischief) of the IPC were also added in the complaint against Akhtar. \nDuring the investigation, the police obtained print-outs of screenshots from Akhtar's Facebook page, which contained the alleged derogatory posts.

For this purpose, ₹4.54 crore was paid, which becomes proceeds of crime, it was contended.\nFormer Mumbai Police Commissioner Sanjay Pandey was earlier granted bail in the same case. \nRamkrishna had argued that she had no connection with brokers, and as per the investigationm none of them had been arrested.\nSenior Advocate Rebecca John had appeared for Ramkrishna in the matter and stated that the allegations against the applicant do not fall within the framework of the scheduled offences, and hence, the rigors of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) will not be applicable. \nShe had also said that the petitioner, being a woman, falls within the proviso to Section 45(1) of the PMLA. \nIn a detailed order, Justice Singh noted that in the present case there was no complaint from NSE or any employee of the NSE that Ramkrishna cheated them\nThe court said that Ramkrishna was always acting on behalf of NSE and representing the stock exchange, therefore, it is wrong to allege that she decided or fraudulently induced NSE to enter into an agreement with the ISEC.\n“In view of the above, prima facie the ingredients of the scheduled offences under IPC viz., Section 120B read with section 420 IPC are not made out against the Applicant,” the court said.\nWith regard to the provision of the Prevention of Corruption (PC) Act, the bench said that the accused is not a public servant and NSE is not a public authority.\nThe judge said that the ED has failed to show how she obtained for herself or for any other person any valuable thing or pecuniary advantage within the meaning of section 13 of PC Act.\n“There is no evidence placed on record to prove corruption or abuse of position by the Applicant. The consideration received by M/s ISEC is pursuant to a contract entered into with NSE and work orders issued with the approval of Mr. Ravi Narain, the Managing Director.

Hence, scheduled offence under section 13 PC Act is not established against the Applicant.”\nThe bench further held that in the present case there is no allegation that Ramkrishna has derives or obtained any property or proceeds of crime.\nJustice Singh concluded that prima facie there are reasonable grounds to believe that the applicant is not guilty of the offence and she is not likely to commit any offence while on bail. He added that the ED has been granted opportunity to oppose the plea therefore the twin conditions stand satisfied\nThe court finally ordered Ramkrishna to be released on bail after she furnished a person bond of ₹1 lakh and a surety of the same amount.\nApart from this case, Ramkrishna is also facing cases by the CBI and ED for the allegations that she was involved in financial misdeeds relating to fixation and frequent revision of compensation of another former NSE employee Anand Subramanian in a disproportionate manner. \nShe is alleged to have done this in cahoots with someone whom she claimed to be a “Siddha Purusha”.\nThe investigating agencies had argued that this \"Siddha Purusha\" is Subramanian himself.\nThe other allegation against Ramkrishna was that she in touch through e-mails with the Himalayan Yogi who the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) later claimed to be none other than Subramanian.\nSenior Advocate Rebecca John along with advocates Rony John, Shivam Batra, Akhil Ranganathan, Subir Sarkar, Ankit Bhushan, Arshdeep Singh, Aditya Luthra, Piyush Swami and Anuj Dubey appeared for Chitra Ramkrishna. \nED was represented through advocates Zoheb Hossain, Vivek Gurnani and Siddharth Sharma."}

{"ID": "id_113", "Summary": "A three-judge bench of the Supreme Court on Monday rejected a plea to abort a pregnancy that had crossed the threshold of 24 weeks under the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971 (MTP Act) in view of a medical report that the foetus is viable.\nA bench of Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud and Justices JB Pardiwala and Manoj Misra said that it cannot go beyond the law as per which termination of pregnancy beyond 24 weeks is permissible only in case of foetal abnormalities or to save the life of the pregnant woman.\nSince this case did not fall under either of the exceptions, the plea was rejected.\nThe Court passed the verdict this afternoon nearly a week after a division bench gave a split verdict in the matter on October 11. \nThe Court today directed the delivery of the child to be conducted at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS). The parents of the child are free to give the baby up for adoption if they wish to do so, the Court added. \n\"Under Article 142 of the Constitution, this Court has the power to do complete justice. However, this power may not be attracted in every case. If a medical termination were to be conducted at this stage, the doctors would be faced with a viable foetus. One of the options before this Court, which the email from AIIMS has flagged, is for it to direct the doctors to stop the heartbeat ... In the absence of a direction to stop the heartbeat, the viable foetus would be faced with a significant risk of lifelong physical and mental disabilities. The reports submitted by the Medical Board speak for themselves. For these reasons, we do not accede to the prayer for the medical termination of the pregnancy,\" the Court said. \nThe matter involved a married couple who had conceived a third time. The pregnancy had crossed the legally permissible limit of 24 weeks for abortions under the MTP Act.\nThe Court was informed that the mother was not aware that she had conceived again since she was going through post-partum infertility and also suffered from post-partum depression.\nOver the course of earlier hearings, the three-judge bench had found itself torn on whether it should allow abortion after a doctor indicated that the foetus could be born with a heartbeat if it is delivered at present.\nBefore this, a Division Bench of Justices Hima Kohli and BV Nagarathna had delivered a split verdict in the matter. While Justice Kohli was not in favour of abortion, Justice Nagarathna opined that the view of the pregnant woman should be respected despite objections that the foetus would be born alive.\nThe matter was marred by controversy, with the previous Division Bench pulling up the Central government for approaching CJI Chandrachud with an oral request to recall an earlier order passed by the two judges to allow the termination of the pregnancy.\nThe CJI later broke a seven-judge Constitution Bench to hear the matter as part of the three-bench constituted to take a final decision following the split verdict of October 11. \nAdditional Solicitor General Aishwarya Bhati appeared for the Central government today and argued that the matter was not about being pro-choice or otherwise. \n\"Now this is a Hobson's choice between preterm delivery and on-time delivery. And on-time delivery, it will give the child a fighting chance. I will stand by that. After 24 weeks, once it is a viable life choice, termination goes once the medical report says that the child is fine,\" she argued. \nSenior Advocate Colin Gonsalves submitted that as per international law, an unborn child or an unborn foetus does not have overriding rights.\n\"Foeticide has been permitted in last 12 years through a guideline of the government and it was laid down in the Nikhil Datar case. All abortions leads to death of foetus as it stills the heart of the child,\" he argued. \nHe added that there were no gestational restrictions as to when a pregnancy can be terminated.\nThe CJI, however, pointed out that India has specific laws on these matters which have to be complied with. \n\"We have our own laws. Exceptions (where abortions are permitted beyond a certain limit) are to foetal abnormalities and to save life of a pregnant woman. In the absence of a challenge to the validity of the (MTP) Act, we have to consider the law as it is. Keep your powder dry for the challenge to the validity of the law. Government of India cannot act contrary to the mandate of this statute,\" the CJI observed. \nThe CJI added that India is not regressive compared to the situation in America after the Roe v. Wade ruling was overturned. \n\"The legislature has done the act of balancing here in India in 2021. Now it is for courts to see if the balancing act is correct or not. Can we deny the power of the legislature to take such steps in these incremental matters? Why should we deny that power to a democratically elected legislature and are we better to do more than that?\" he asked. \nGonsalves replied that India is regressive when it comes to its abortion laws, to which the CJI disagreed. \n\"I do not think so. Every democracy has its own organs and they must function. You are telling us to override our statute based on WHO statement? I do not think this can be done\", the Chief Justice of India said.\nThe counsel for the woman reiterated that the pregnancy was unwanted. However, the Court ultimately decided not to accede to the pregnant woman's plea."}

{"ID": "id_1135", "Summary": "The Allahabad High Court on Monday upheld an order of Sultanpur Sessions Court that had rejected Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's revision application seeking discharge in a case of alleged inflammatory speech delivered by him in the run-up to 2014 Lok Sabha elections [Arvind Kejriwal vs Stae of UP and Anr.].\nJustice Rajesh Singh Chauhan observed that Kejriwal's statement threatened voters in the name of 'Khuda' knowing that the term will severely influence some set of voters belonging to different religion.\n\"The statement so given by the applicant is not so plain and simple inasmuch as for one set of voters, he is uttering the term ‘Gaddar of the country’ and for the other set of voters, he is saying that ‘Khuda shall not pardon them’. Prima facie, it appears that he is threatening the later voters in the name of Khuda knowing fully well that if he uses the term ‘Khuda’, some set of voters belonging to different religion might have severely been influenced,\" the Court said.\nA first information report (FIR) against Kejriwal was registered by a Flying Squad Magistrate under Section 125 (promoting enmity between classes in connection with election) of the Representation of the People Act alleging that he had flouted the model code of conduct by stating,\n\"Jo Congress ko vote dega, mera manana hoga, desh ke saath gaddari hogi. Bhajpa per katakch karte hue kaha ki jo Bhajpa ko vote dega use Khuda bhi muaf nahin karega, des ke sath gaddari hogi.\"\nHis application for discharge was rejected by a Magistrate's Court in Sultanpur. The revision application was rejected by a Sessions Court.\nBefore the High Court, Kejriwal challenged both the orders contending that he cannot be held liable for the offence under Section 125 as he had not made any appeal for votes on the ground of religion and had not promoted enmity between classes. \nAdvocate Mahmood Alam, who appeared for Kejriwal, informed the court that Kejriwal had been granted bail and further stated that his speech was merely based on his personal opinion and was, therefore, protected under Article 19 of the Constitution.\nAdditional Government Advocate Alok Saran opposed the application stating that this was the Delhi CM's third application under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) in the same case and that in the second application, the police had found a prima facie case and submitted a charge sheet.\nTherefore, he contended that the charge could be proved or disproved only before the trial court and no interference was required by the High Court under Section 482.\nFurther, he contended that the statement was apparently violative of Section 125 of the Representation of the People Act as it said that the people voting for Congress would be 'Gaddars' and the ones voting for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) shall not be pardoned by Khuda. \nAccording to Saran, Kejriwal could have used the word 'Bhagwan' instead of 'Khuda' but deliberately used the word 'Khuda' for those who vote for the BJP.\nHe said that since the courts below had considered Kejriwal's arguments thoroughly and returned their findings strictly in accordance with law, there was no infirmity in those orders.\nThe Court highlighted that Article 19 of the Constitution gives all citizens the rights regarding freedom of speech and expression but subject to reasonable restrictions for preserving inter-alia public order, decency or morality.\nStating the the extent of protection of speech would depend on whether it propagates ideas or has social value, the Court remarked that it was unable to comprehend as to how such a speech would constitute a propagation of ideas or would have any social value\nThe Court determined that the intent behind the usage of the word 'Khuda' was a matter of trial. \nHence, it directed Kejriwal to participate in the trial and dismissed his petition."}
{"ID": "id_1136", "Summary": "The Bombay High Court recently quashed all blacklisting orders issued by the Regional Transport Office (RTO) against several Bharat Stage-IV (BS-IV) compliant vehicles which were sold as second-hand sales after the Supreme Court mandated deadline of March 31, 2020 [Micropark Logistics Pvt Ltd vs. The State of Maharashtra & Anr.]. \nThe Court directed that cancelled registrations of such vehicles be restored by the transport authorities at the earliest.\nThe order came in a bunch of petitions filed by vehicle owners, primarily those associated with distributors challenging the orders of blacklisting and cancelling registration of their BS-IV compliant vehicles. \nThey claimed that they had registered the sale of their vehicles before the Supreme Court deadline. However, the authorities refused to register the automobiles claiming the vehicle owners had missed the Supreme Court imposed deadline of March 31, 2020.\nIn 2018, the Supreme Court had directed the Central and State governments not to permit sale or registration of motor vehicles conforming to the emission standard BS-IV across the country with effect from April 1, 2020 in order to facilitate the transition from BS-IV to BS-VI technology.\nBoth BS-IV and BS-VI are unit emission norms that set the maximum permissible levels for pollutants that an automotive or a two-wheeler exhaust can emit.\nThe road transport authorities had opposed the plea in High Court, stating that the dealers and distributors had registered the BS-IV compliant vehicles in the names of their directors, owners, or persons connected with them before the deadline to get around the Supreme Court's prohibition.\nThey sought to register the sales of these vehicles to outsiders as second sales, since sales by distributors after March 31, 2020 were all illegal.\nThe Division Bench of Justices Gautam Patel and Madhav Jamdar, however, directed reinstatement of the revoked registrations.\n\"...once these vehicles fall in the class of legitimately registered and permissible BS-IV compliant vehicles, are they prohibited from what is in effect a used-car or second-hand sale. This does not seem to have been prohibited by the Supreme Court orders,\" the order stated. \nThe apprehension by the authorities that the Supreme Court orders must necessarily result in a prohibition on second-hand sales does not appear to be correct, the Court made it clear. \n\"If such second sales are not allowed (of vehicles complying with the 31st March 2020 deadline), then another, possible absurd and possibly environmentally unacceptable result would occur namely that there would be a large stock of vehicles now in the names of individuals connected with distributorship or dealership which could not be used at all and would have to be turned to scrap or junked without ever being used. We see nothing in the orders passed by the Supreme Court to support such a rigid view,\" the bench explained.\nThe Bench quashed the blacklisting orders against all vehicles and directed all concerned RTOs to restore the cancelled registrations of the vehicles of the two petitioners.\nThe order clarified that if any vehicle is found be first sold or RTO registration is sought after April 1, 2020, then it would fall afoul of the Supreme Court mandate and was not permitted to be registered, sold or plied on the road."}
{"ID": "id_1137", "Summary": "The Delhi High Court has dismissed a plea challenging the election of Union Minister of State for External Affairs and Culture Meenakshi Lekhi from the New Delhi constituency in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls over alleged discrepancies in poll expenditure [Ramesh v. Meenakshi Lekhi]\nJustice Sanjeev Narula said that the election petition was fundamentally lacking in \"material facts”.\n\"Sans any underpinning material, the petitioner’s broad averments are insufficient to sustain the allegations of electoral corrupt practices,” the judgment stated.\nThe petitioner had contested against Lekhi as an independent candidate from the New Delhi constituency in the 2019 general elections.\nHe alleged discrepancies in her poll expenditure and accused her of having engaged in corrupt electoral practices. \nOne of the allegations was that she had crossed the Election Commission of India’s stipulated ceiling of ₹70 lakh in campaign-related expenses by reportedly organising a large-scale event and spending over ₹1 crore.\nIn Lekhi’s defense, it was argued that the accusations were broad, imprecise and lacked substantial evidence or documentation supporting claims of corrupt election practices. \nIt was contended that the petitioner's affidavit accompanying the petition was not in compliance with the Representation of People Act and Conduct of Election Rules, 1961.\nThe High Court observed that though the petitioner had accused Lekhi of  exceeding the permissible election expenditure limit, the basis of the claim remained vague. \n“Throughout the petition, the central contention seems to be that respondent understated the expenses related to election activities in the official register. However, there is a conspicuous absence of specific details highlighting the discrepancies between the declared amounts and the alleged actual expenditures. Petitioner’s claims appear to be predicated on conjectures and assumptions rather than on solid evidence,” it noted.\nJustice Narula also said tat the affidavit accompanying the petition deviates from the prescribed format, and given the quasi-criminal nature of allegations concerning electoral malpractices, it is paramount that these assertions were treated with the gravity they deserve.\n“The petition being bereft of a cause of action, is dismissed under Order VII Rule 11 of the CPC,” the Court held.\nAdvocates Harish Pandey and Anshuman Tiwari represented Lekhi.\nThe petitioner, Ramesh, appeared in person."}
{"ID": "id_1138", "Summary": "The Supreme Court on Thursday observed that mother being the only natural guardian of the child has the right to decide the surname of the child, as also give the child up for adoption. (Akella Lalitha vs Konda Rao and ors)\nThus, a direction of the Andhra Pradesh High Court to a mother to restore her child's original surname from his step-father's surname, was set aside by the top court.\nA division bench of Justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Krishna Murari said that such a direction of the High Court to a mother, who had remarried after her first husband's death, to restore her child's original surname, was \"almost mindless and cruel\".\n\"The mother being the only natural guardian of the child has the right to decide the surname of the child. She also has the right to give the child in adoption,\" the Bench said.\nThe division bench opined that when a child is adopted into a new home, it is only logical that he takes the surname of the adoptive family.\n\"The direction of the High Court to include the name of the Appellant’s husband as step-father in documents is almost cruel and mindless of how it would impact the mental health and self-esteem of the child. A name is important as a child derives his identity from it and a difference in name from his family would act as a constant reminder of the factum of adoption and expose the child to unnecessary questions hindering a smooth, natural relationship between him and his parents,\" the Bench observed. \nThe instant case dealt with a custody battle between appellant-mother and the paternal grandparents of the child who in 2008 sought for the child's custody under the Guardians and Wards Act after the mother remarried.\nA trial court rejected the grandparents' plea for custody holding that it would not be sensible to separate the child from mother. It, however, granted limited visitation rights to the grandparents, which the High Court also upheld.\nThe High Court also added the following two additional conditions:\nThe mother shall complete formalities for restoring the original surname of the child to that of the biological father's (and not step-father) within a period of three months. \nWherever records permit, the biological father's name shall be shown; if otherwise impermissible, the name of the present husband will be mentioned as step-father. \nAggrieved by the additional conditions, the mother challenged the order in Supreme Court on the ground that the grandparents had never prayed for such conditions in their petition though the High Court added the same in its order. \nThe Supreme Court, at the outset, asked how a mother could be lawfully restrained from including her child into a new family with a new surname. \n\"When such child takes on to be a kosher member of the adoptive family it is only logical that he takes the surname of the adoptive family and it is thus befuddling to see judicial intervention in such a matter,\" the Court said.\nThe apex court held that while the High Court may have the power to intervene, it can be done only when a prayer specific to that effect is made and such prayer must be centred on the premise that child’s interest is the primary consideration and it outweighs all other considerations.\nThe Bench also noted that the mother's second husband had formally adopted the child as per the Hindu Adoption & Maintenance Act, maintaining that a formal adoption process need not have taken place. \nIt, therefore, set aside the High Court's directions as regards surname.\nAdvocates Ravi Bassi and Surender Kumar Gupta represented the appellant."}

Period for exchange of old notes not unreasonable;\n- There was consultation between the Central government and the RBI for a period of 6 months.

It is for all series of bank notes;\n- RBI does not have any independent power to bring in demonetization.\nJustice BV Nagarathna dissents\nJustice Nagarathna, however, differed on the answers of each of the questions, and delivered a dissenting judgment.\n\"I have noted that RBI is the bulwark of Indian economy. I have cited history of such demonetisation exercise world over.

Therefore, in my view, powers of Centre being vast, the same has to be done by plenary legislation.\"\n\"Without Parliament, a democracy cannot thrive...Parliament cannot be left aloof on such important decisions,\" she went on to state.\nSignificantly, she held,\n\"There is an inherent contradiction in the provision of Section 26(2) [of the RBI Act] itself.

Beyond that period we did not give any guarantee.\"\nAttorney General (AG) for India R Venkataramani, representing the Central government, had stressed that the distinctions made for grace periods for different categories were not arbitrary.\nOn the contention by one of the petitioners that their right to dignity was affected, the AG had said,\n\"The dignity aspect should be preserved for more precious cases. An NRI goes abroad for financial benefit, no question of dignity there. Dignity involves privacy etc.\"\nSenior Advocate P Chidambaram had told the Supreme Court that the Central government should disclose documents revealing how the 2016 demonetisation exercise was approved, so that the top court can decide the legal validity of the move.\nThe Court had, on the final day of the hearing, asked the Central government to hand over some undisclosed documents relating to the decision, in a sealed cover."}

The petitioner in the case was one of the two directors of the company.\nThe main contention of the counsel for the petitioner was that approval of the resolution plan in the insolvency proceeding in relation to the defaulter company would ipso facto discharge both the directors of the defaulter company.\nA bench of Justices Sunita Agarwal and Vipin Chandra Dixit rejected the argument noting that the approval of a resolution plan does not ipso facto absolve the surety/guarantor of his or her liability, which arises out of an independent contract of guarantee.\n\"The challenge to the demand notice for dues of electricity, issued jointly in the name of the Directors of the Corporate debtor, the defaulter company which went into insolvency cannot be sustained on the ground that in view of the acceptance of the resolution plan under Section 31 of the Code, all liabilities of the Directors, who may be the guarantor, stood automatically discharged/extinguished...the writ petition is, accordingly, dismissed,\" the Court held.\nTo what extent, the liability of a guarantor can be pressed into service would depend on the terms of the guarantee/contract itself, the Court added.\nPranjal Mehrotra, counsel for the Electricity Department submitted that clause 4.3(f) and clause 6.15 of the Electricity Supply Code, 2005 clearly empower the department to issue recovery proceeding against the directors of the company and any payment due to the licensee company can be recovered as arrears of land revenue as per the provisions of the Act 1958, in accordance with the clause 6.15 of the Electricity Supply Code.\nIt was further submitted that out of total outstanding dues of the corporation against the defaulter company to the tune of ₹9 crores, only an amount of ₹6.62 lakh was directed to be distributed as per the approved resolution plan, under the order dated March 22, 2022 passed by the NCLT, Allahabad.\nA letter of January 11, 2018 by the UP Power Corporation was produced before Court to assert that the direction was issued to Managing Directors of all the Discoms, to recover dues of electricity from the director/owner of the defaulter company. \nIt was argued that Clause 4.3 (f)(v) clearly provides that the directors of the company shall be liable for the electricity dues of the company.\nThe bench relied upon Supreme Court judgment in State Bank of India vs V. Ramakrishna and another wherein it was held that the object of the IBC is not to allow personal guarantors such as directors, who are in management of the companies, to escape from an independent and co-existent liability to pay off the entire outstanding debt. \nThe Court noted that the legal issue with regard to the liability of the personal guarantor of the corporate debtor whose liability is co-extensive with the principal debtor, has been answered. \nHowever, for the rest of the issues, if any, arise with regard to the nature or extent of liability of the petitioner or another director of the company as personal guarantor, the same were not answered as no arguments have been placed in that regard, the Court added.\n\"In view of the above discussion, the challenge to the demand notice for dues of electricity, issued jointly in the name of the directors of the corporate debtor, the defaulter company which went into insolvency cannot be sustained on the ground that in view of the acceptance of the resolution plan under Section 31 of the Code, all liabilities of the directors, who may be the guarantor, stood automatically discharged/extinguished,\" the Court concluded."}

Her contention stems from an apprehension that the faulty online testing mechanism of the OMR sheet has led to her scoring 0 marks out of 720.\nReferring to the Supreme Court's judgment in Ran Vijay Singh & ors v.

{"ID": "id_1146", "Summary": "The Bombay High Court recently affirmed the dismissal order of Maharashtra RERA Appellate Tribunal. The Court directed compliance with Maharashtra RERA Adjudicating Authority order directing payment of Rs. 5 crores compensation payable to a party who had not been handed over the possession of certain property even after a delay over around 80 months.\nThe order was passed by Justice SC Gupte, who dismissed a second appeal in the matter filed by Renaissance Infrastructure Ltd. i.e. the promoters, who were represented by Senior Advocate Prasad Dani along with Advocate Sachin Pawar.\nThe dispute arose after Renaissance failed to give possession of the premises in 2010, as agreed by them in an agreement for sale between Renaissance and the purchasers. \nThe RERA authority calculated the compensation, as per the clauses in the agreement, as amounting to Rs. 5.04 crore. Ruling in favour of the purchasers, the RERA authority ordered Renaissance to pay Rs. 6.3 lakhs per month and to hand over possession of the property to the purchasers.\nRenaissance challenged this order before the appellate Tribunal. The appellate Tribunal asked Renaissance to deposit 50% of the compensation amount as per Section 43(5) of the RERA Act for entertaining the appeal.\nHowever, when Renaissance failed to pay the pre-deposit, the appellate Tribunal dismissed the appeal. Therefore, Renaissance filed a second appeal in the Bombay High Court. \nBefore the High Court, Senior Advocate Dani submitted:\nThat the agreement between Renaissance and purchaser was in lieu of a partnership, hence Renaissance was not a promoter.\nThat original claim of the purchasers was devoid of merits.\nThat the challenged order was in the nature of liquidated damages, which the authority has no jurisdiction over.\nJustice Gupte, however, found no infirmities in the orders passed by the RERA Authority and the RERA Appellate Tribunal. He held that the orders do not give rise to any substantial question of law for the consideration of the High Court. \nAmong other reasons, Justice Gupte observed that Renaissance was developing plots and was liable to hand over the property as agreed to, regardless of whether the purchaser was a former partner.\nHe remarked that “under this agreement, termed as 'agreement for sale', the Appellant was bound to hand over possession of the suit premises to the Respondent within an agreed period” and thus the agreement is “nothing less than an agreement for sale.”\nThe Court added, \n\"Afterall, consideration of an agreement for sale, instead of money, may well be any valuable consideration, including satisfaction of the allottee’s share in the promoter’s partnership.”\nFurther, it was observed that none of the other grounds pleaded by Dani “call for dispension of pre-deposit” before the appellate Tribunal under Section 43(5) of the RERA Act, which is mandatory.\nTherefore, the High Court dismissed the second appeal and ordered as follows:\nDani applied for a stay of this Order.

It is settled law that honesty of integrity of employees/officers working in the banks who are dealing with public money must be paramount,\" the Court said.\nHence, an officer who is found to have been involved in financial irregularities while performing his duty as bank officer, cannot be let off even if there is a minor infraction in the inquiry report, the Court underlined.\n“The banking system is the backbone of the Indian economy. An officer who is found to have been involved in financial irregularities while performing his duty as bank officer, cannot be let off even if there is a minor infraction in the inquiry report,” the court observed.\nJustice Singh made the observations while dismissing a plea by one Vijay Kumar Gupta who served as Assistant Manager with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).\nGupta was posted at Currency Verification and Processing System in 2005 and was entrusted with processing and shredding of currencies worth ₹4,50,000. During a surprise check of the cancelled notes brought for shredding in the shredding room, it was noticed that there was a shortage of 50 pieces of ₹100 denomination in three packets.\nAs a result, two alternate charges of wilfully not performing his duties towards the bank and that of surreptitiously abstracting/pilfering the currency notes to derive pecuniary benefit and having displayed gross negligence were framed against the petitioner.\nAfter a disciplinary inquiry, Gupta was dismissed from the bank’s service and ₹5,000 was ordered to be recovered from him. The appeal against the order was also dismissed by the Appellate Authority.\nHe approached the High Court against the order stating that there were procedural infractions and violation of principles of natural justice in the order.\nHowever, after considering the arguments, Justice Singh held that there was sufficient material on record to establish the petitioner's guilt.\nThe Court said that in the departmental inquiry, the standard of proof is not that of a criminal case, rather the test applicable is that of merely the preponderance of probabilities.\nThe allegations which have been levelled against the petitioner are certainly serious in nature and this amounts to gross misconduct. Therefore, I do not find any force in the argument of the petitioner that the punishment which has been awarded to the petitioner for removal from service is not proportionate, the Court said.\n“In view of the above discussion on facts as well as law, this Court does not find that there has been any procedural infraction or violation of Principles of Natural Justice in conducting the inquiry against the petitioner. It is also decided in the foregoing paragraphs that there is sufficient material on record to establish the guilt of the petitioner,” the Court held.\nThe petition was, therefore, dismissed.\nAdvocates Pooja M Saigal, Anshul Bajaj and Simrat Singh Pasay appeared for the petitioner.\nRespondents were represented through Senior Advocate Suhail Dutt along with advocates HS Parihar, Kuldeep Singh Parihar and Ikshita Parihar."}

They highlighted the fact that often when such officers on duty prefer voting through ballot under Rule 23 of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961, they do not receive such ballot papers in time, thereby depriving them of their right to vote.\nTherefore, the PIL petition sought orders to the ECI to ensure that ballots as provided under the law, are sent to them at their respective duty centres well before in time.\nThe judges noted Rule 20 provides for an option for the voters on duty, to exercise their right either to vote through postal ballot or to vote in-person at the polling booth.\n\"For the former, an application of the nature prescribed in Form 12 has to be filled in whereas for the latter, an application has to be made in Form 12A.

{"ID": "id_1172", "Summary": "The Delhi High Court on Friday granted an interim relief to Times Now while restraining Republic TV from using the trademark ‘NEWS HOUR’ or any other mark that may be deceptively similar to it.\nThe Court, however, refused to grant any interim relief with respect to use of the tag line \"nation wants to know\" stating that a detailed examination of the issue is required.\nThe partial relief of interim injunction was granted in favour of the Benett Coleman & Co., the parent company of the channel Times Now, by a single Judge Bench of Justice Jayant Nath. \nThe media conglomerate had moved the High Court seeking a permanent injunction against Arnab Goswami's ARG Media Outlier from using the marks 'News Hour' and 'Nation Wants to Know' or any other derivatives or combinations of the same.\nThe dispute between the Times Group and Republic Network over these has its genesis in Anchor Editor Arnab Goswami's exit from Times Now in 2016 to set up his own venture ARG Outlier Media Ltd of which the Republic Network is a product.\nDuring Goswami's time in Times Now as its Editor-in-chief, the channel launched one of its flagship debate/discussion programs titled News Hour in 2006. \nThe trademark \"News Hour\" was registered by the Times Group under Classes 16, 35 and 38 in 2014 and the mark itself has been in use since 2006. Therefore, the plaintiff Group claimed statutory right over this trademark.\nAs regards the phrase \"Nation wants to know\", Times Group claims that this tagline was a product of the efforts of the editorial and marketing team during the creative efforts undertaken for and on behalf of the plaintiff group. The phrase or tagline was to be used during the debates and discussions conducted during the primetime program News Hour, which was anchored by Goswami up until his departure in November 2016. \nThis tagline, the Times Group says, has \"acquired goodwill and distinctiveness indicative of the programme originating from the plaintiff in the eyes of the viewers of the channel.\"\nAs such, the Times Group applied for registration of trademark on this tag line under Classes 38 and 41 in December of 2016, just days after Goswami's notoriously unceremonious exit from Times Group whereas Goswami sought to stake claim on the tagline since just two days after his departure from the plaintiff's company.\nThe Plaintiff also alleges that Goswami took \"undue advantage\" of the popularity of the program he anchored at Times Now. Despite his employment agreement with Times Group vesting all rights to intellectual property exclusively with the plaintiff company, Goswami proceeded to use the disputed marks, the Times Group averred.\n\"...any brand image which may have accrued to defendant No. 2 over the period of time on account of being an anchor of the plaintiff’s show was due to the investment made by the plaintiff and defendant No. 2 represented the plaintiff and hence, all goodwill and proprietary rights created during such period belong to the plaintiff,\" the Court recorded the plaintiff's stance.\nThe Republic TV, on the other hand, claims that the viewers of the two news channels are \"informed and literate\" and cannot confuse the programs aired on the two channels especially since the animosity between thew two is matter of public knowledge. \nTimes Group initiated the present proceedings \"in the form of vendetta litigation\" merely with the intention to \"attempt to harass and arm twist\" the defendant.\nRepublic argues that the words \"News Hour\" are generic, widely used and as such Times Group cannot claim a proprietary right on the same. In fact, Republic has even questioned the granting of trademark in favour of plaintiff terming the same as erroneous on the grounds that the term lacks distinveness and ought not have been granted as a trademark.\nOn the tagline \"nation wants to know\", the defendant submits that the phrase or line was used by Goswami during his time at the Times Group. However, it was neither scripted nor planned or a product of a creative process. It was just a line that happened to be used as part of a common speech by Goswami during his then debate program on Times Now. \nOver time, this line became synonymous with Goswami and Times Group cannot claim proprietary right over it in any way, it is argued.\nPertinently, ARG Outlier Media has itself applied for registeration of terms \"News Hour\" and \"Nation Wants to Know\" while claiming that these terms lack distinctiveness and the issue was objected to by the plaintiff who averred that the defendant cannot be permitted to \"approbate and reprobate before the courts of law.\"\nThe Court, however, found no merit in defendant's argument against distintiveness of the registered mark of \"News Hour\". The mark is a registered trade mark since 2014 which was prima facie used in 2006 and has been in use since.\nAs such, Defendant's use of prefix or suffix against the registered mark would also be viewed as being deceptively similar and the plaintiff would be entitled to relief in this regard. Observing the same, the Court granted an interim injunction against the use of \"News Hour\" or anything deceptively similar to it.\nThe second mark in dispute is not a registered mark and is a tagline that both parties stake claim on giving rise to the question of whether the defendant was indulging in passing off. While plaintiff claimed proprietary right, defendant said that the tagline was never associated with the plaintiff but always with Goswami.\nThe Court, however, opined that this issue needs further examination of documents adduced by both sides and can be done when the parties lead evidence. The Court said, \"The date of user of the tagline NWTK can only be decided appropriately after the parties have led their evidence.\" It added,\nThe Court also stated that whether or not the tagline was used as a trademark is an aspect that needs to be delved into in detail.\nTherefore, in a partial relief, the Court granted an interim injunction in favour of Times Group, refraining Republic Network from using \"News Hour\" or anything deceptively similar to it with no interim relief being granted with respect to \"nation wants to know\"\nRead Order:"}

A note was found wrapped in a plastic bag in his pocket stating that he was ending his life due to continued harassment by Madan Chaudhari and Balaji Gaikwad. It was alleged that the duo didn't pay him ₹40,000 from his potluck fund and had also threatened to shut his medical store. \nThe trial court had in its judgment noted that there was no description of the manner in which the duo harassed the deceased.

Union of India]\nThe division bench of Justice Vivek Chaudhary and Justice Manish Kumar highlighted a unique difficulty being faced by the Lucknow bench due to litigants choosing to file petitions related to the same subject matter before both Allahabad and Lucknow benches of the High Court.\n“Under Clause-14 of United Provinces High Court (Amalgamation) Order, the petitions can be transferred by the Chief Justice while sitting at Lucknow to Allahabad but same can neither be transferred by him from Allahabad to Lucknow nor any Court can summon them,” it noted.\nThe Court explained that matters at Allahabad can only be heard at Allahabad as the Lucknow bench cannot summon them. \n“It creates a unique difficulty,” the Lucknow bench judges observed.  \nThe Court underscored that the litigant in the garb of his power to choose forum cannot cause inconvenience to the Court and keep the matter pending unnecessarily in a bifurcated manner.\n“A party has a choice to invoke jurisdiction of this Court either at Allahabad or at Lucknow and once they have exercised the said choice, parties should restrict themselves to their initial choice of forum while filing later petitions”.\nObserving that such disputes were frequently occurring before the Lucknow bench, the Court said the issues needs to be solved.\nIt added that unnecessary hurdles are created in disposal of cases when jurisdiction is changed from one place to another by the parties to the dispute.\nThe Court was hearing a petition related to a tenant-landlord dispute. The petitioner was a practicing advocate.\nThe maintainability of the petition was challenged by the respondents on the ground that the petitioner had previously filed two petitions in relation to the same dispute before Allahabad bench.\nHowever, the petitioner argued that the cause of action in the latest petition had arisen within the territorial jurisdiction of Lucknow as well as Allahabad. Thus, he said, the petition was maintainable.\nThe Court concluded that the filing of the latest petition at Lucknow amounted to forum hunting.\nIt is not the litigant's convenience alone which needs to be looked into but convenience of all related is also relevant including that of Court. \nThe Court opined that the case was a “glaring example” of a litigant hopping around jurisdictions. \nThe difficulty being faced by this Court is created by the petitioner only, it added. \n“Hopping around forums would be highly inconvenient to the working of the Court as in the present case.

Tata AIG Life Insurance Corporation Ltd). \nPresiding Member Dinesh Singh held that investigation by a private agency hired by the insurance company to probe an incident cannot replace the investigation conducted by the police. The order states,\n“In a case of unnatural death, where a DD entry is duly made, an inquest is duly carried out, a post mortem is duly conducted, a private agency providing “medico-legal services” does not wholly substitute for and replace Investigation by the Police.”\nIn the present case, the husband/father of the complainants had obtained four insurance policies from the respondent through one agent. The husband passed away after being hit by a running train while crossing the tracks.\nOn his death, benefits from three policies were directed to the wife and son. However, the company denied the claim on the fourth policy, asserting that the death was not an accident but a suicide. The company also argued that the first three policies were concealed while taking the fourth policy.\nWhile deciding the matter, the Commission stated that there was no evidence that suggested any malafide on the part of the life-insured. It relied on the Supreme Court judgment in M/s Modern Insulators Ltd v. Oriental Insurance Co Ltd, in which it was held,\n“The non-disclosure of the previous policies by the life assured is not fatal to the claim of the complainants.”\nThe NCDRC observed that the State Commission principally relied on the medico-legal opinion of a private agency while determining that the death was by suicide. However, the post-mortem report as well as the police report concluded that railway accident could not be ruled out as a cause of death. \nThe police report stated, \n“While crossing the railway line was coming from one colony to another in a hurry and due to hurry might have fallen on railway line and due to fall died by coming beneath the speedy train. Therefore, the cause of this accident due to rail accident cannot be denied. The cause of death in this case railway accident cannot be ruled out.”\nIn this light, the NCDRC found that a private agency engaged by the insurance company cannot substitute the police.\nWhile setting aside the State Commission order, the Presiding Member also advised the insurance company to imbibe systemic improvements in the future so as to avoid inconsistency and arbitrariness in decision making.\nThe respondent was accordingly directed to settle the claim in question with interest at the rate of 9% per annum from the date of filing of the complaint before the State Commission till realization, within a period of four weeks from today. \nOut of the costs of Rs 1 lakh, Rs 50,000 was directed to be paid to the complainants and Rs 50,000 to be deposited in the Consumer Legal Aid Account of the State Commission.\nAdvocate Praveen Kumar Aggarwal appeared for the appellants.

[L&T Finance Limited v.

It added that the magistrate was not even required to adjudicate any dispute between the borrower, third parties and the secured creditor concerning the secured assets. \n\"Any delay in that was unacceptable given the emphasis of this enactment on expediency. Such enormous backlog of applications under Section 14 in Maharashtra is inconsistent with the objectives of the Act and defeats the legislative intent emphasized by the Supreme Court,” the order stated.\nStressing on the importance of expeditious disposal of such applications for recovery of bad loans, the Court said,\n“It is needless to stress the importance of expeditious disposal of the applications under section 14 of the SARFAESI Act, as the pendency of a large number of applications hinders the recovery of bad loans, which has a significant impact on the financial health of the country.”\nThe Bench disposed of a clutch of petitions raising grievance that Section 14 applications had remained pending before the magistrate for an unduly long period. The petitioners highlighted the lethargy of the authorities, their reluctance to proceed under Section 14 and borrowers causing the delay. \nThe High Court clubbed all such petitions and sought assistance from the State government and High Court administration to find a solution. \nThe Court was informed that on April 10, 2023, the State government issued a circular to all magistrates with following directions: \nall pending applications filed before March 31, 2023 should be disposed off by April 30, 2023. \nall applications filed after March 31, 2023 should be disposed of within thirty days. \norders passed under Section 14 must be implemented within four weeks.\nif existing officers are overburdened, an advocate can be appointed to implement the order as per law. \na report must be submitted on applications and orders not disposed of within thirty days, and parties can make representations if an application is not disposed of or an order is not implemented within sixty days. \nan online platform will be implemented to record all information and statistics.\nThe Court said that these guidelines could also reduce the inflow of petitions by secured creditors before the High Court.\nIt also noted that implementation of an e-system would improve transparency and efficiency, and keep all parties informed about pending applications. \nTo reinforce the guidelines and effectuate the intent of the SARFAESI Act, the Bench reiterated them as directions in its order. \nIt directed that the e-system be implemented within 16 weeks. \nAdvocates SS Panchpor, SS Agave appeared for TJSB Sahakari Bank.\nAdvocate Asha Bhuta from Bhuta & Associates appeared for The National Co-operative Bank\nSaraf with government pleaders PP Kakade, Shruti Vyas and Himanshu Takke appeared for State.\nAdvocate SR Nargolkar appeared for Magistrate and High Court administration."}

[Yogesh Upadhyay and Another v. Atlanta Limited]\nA division bench of Justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Sanjay Kumar rejected a contention that it would be impermissible for the Court to transfer such cases on account of a non-obstante clause in Section 142(1) of the NI Act overriding Section 406, CrPC.\n\"Notwithstanding the non-obstante clause in Section 142(1) of the Act of 1881, the power of this Court to transfer criminal cases under Section 406 Cr.P.C. remains intact in relation to offences under Section 138 of the Act of 1881, if it is found expedient for the ends of justice,\" the Court observed.\nBy way of background, the petitioners, comprising of an individual and his proprietary concern, were facing a total of six cheque-bounce cases. \nTwo of these cases were filed in Nagpur, Maharashtra while the remaining four were in Delhi. The petitioner had moved the Supreme Court with a plea to transfer the cases filed in Nagpur to Delhi, so that all the cases may be heard together in Delhi. \nThe petitioners contended that all the cheques under scrutiny relate to the same transaction. Hence, it was argued that it would be proper that the cases pertaining to the dishonour of such cheques be tried and decided together.\nThe company that had filed the cases against the petitioner, however, countered that Section 142 of the NI Act was a non-obstante clause that conferred exclusive jurisdiction on the court having jurisdiction over the area where the payee or holder in due course maintains a bank account. Thus, it was contended that the Nagpur court had exclusive jurisdiction to deal with the two cases filed in Nagpur. \nPertinently, the company also asserted that the non-obstante clause in Section 142, NI Act would override the power to transfer cases under Section 406 of CrPC. Therefore, it was argued that the Nagpur cases could not be transferred to Delhi. \nThe Supreme Court opined that the argument on the non-obstante clause in Section 142 of NI Act overriding Section 406 of CrPC cannot be accepted.\n\"The said clause merely has reference to the manner in which cognizance is to be taken in offences under Section 138 of the Act of 1881, as a departure has to be made from the usual procedure inasmuch as prosecution for the said offence stands postponed despite commission of the offence being complete upon dishonour of the cheque and it must necessarily be in terms of the procedure prescribed,\" the Court explained.\nThe 'notwithstanding' clause under Section 142 of the NI Act has to be read and understood in the context and for the purpose it is used, the Court said. \nThis clause does not lend itself to the interpretation that Section 406, CrPC would stand excluded vis-à-vis offences under Section 138 of the NI Act, the bench held. \n\"The power of this Court to transfer pending criminal proceedings under Section 406 Cr.P.C. does not stand abrogated thereby in respect of offences under Section 138 of the Act of 1881,\" the judgment stated.\nThe Court proceeded to agree with the petitioners that it would be convenient for the parties if all six cases were tried together in Delhi since the cheques in question concerned the same transaction. A common adjudication would obviate the possibility of there being contradictory findings being rendered in different courts, the Court noted. \nIn view of the above, it allowed the petitioners' plea to transfer the cases filed in Nagpur to Delhi so that all six cases filed against the petitioner may be tried together in Delhi. \nAdvocate Rajmangal Kumar appeared for the petitioners.

Seen in this context coupled with the fact that the accused company has started making profit and is generating cash from operations, the valuation of equity shares given by the valuer as per DCF method does not seem to be lofty at all and it certainly can not be termed as bogus,\" the Court said.\nAs per the complainant, the accused wilfully evaded tax and the entire aggregate amount received in the Assessment Year 2019-20 from sale of the shares was to be treated as revenue of the company, and not as capital.\nThe Court said that Section 276C (1) of the Income Tax Act, which was invoked in the complaint against Newslaundry, talks of a wilful attempt to evade tax. In this light, it stated,\n\"Firstly, there was no attempt to evade tax, it is not the case of the complainant that accused no.1 did not disclose the factum of allotment of shares at premium in its accounts or financial statements. It is also not the case of the complainant that there was any wrong entry in the books of accounts, balance sheet and income tax return.\"\nThe Court underlined that the information relied on by the Tax Department was wilfully supplied by the accused, and said that although there may be different points of view on what is to be treated as capital or revenue, it could not be said that the accused had wilfully evaded tax.\n\"All the information that the complainant is relying upon is supplied by the accused. All the information was disclosed in the books of accounts. There may be different points of view on what is to be treated as an item of revenue and what is to be treated as capital receipt but it does not amount to wilful attempt to evade tax. Even a tax exemption wrongly claimed under a bona fide belief would not make section 276C of the Act applicable to assessee,\" the Court said.\nIt added that if the Department wanted to treat the capital receipts as revenue receipts, it was free to do so and may pass an assessment order making additions to the income of the company for the relevant financial year and issue a notice of demand.\nFurther, noting that the company's cash flow statements were impressive, the Court stated that Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) method of valuation, adopted by the company was one of the best methods to value startups as other methods are bound to assign negative value to startups.\n\"...one of the best methods to value a startup is DCF method as other methods which take income, assets or net worth as basis for valuation of a business are bound to give negative value of business as none of these methods are forward looking and initially most start ups incur loses because most businesses have a gestation period,\" the Court said.\nResultantly, the Court held that the valuation report was genuine and compliant with guidelines, without any material irregularities. Hence, it determined that there was no commission of an offence or conspiracy and dismissed the complaint terming it bereft of merit.\nSpecial Public Prosecutor Anish Dhingra appeared for the Income Tax Department."}

Please tell us steps to solve this,\" Justice Chandrachud remarked. during the hearing. \nThe Court proceeded to record the same in its order. \n\"At the outset, it needs to be clarified that why this Court is hearing this plea is because exercising powers under contempt jurisdiction will not solve the problem faced by Delhi. When country is facing a humanitarian crisis, court must aim at problem solving,\" the order said. \nAs of now, we see no reason to use contempt jurisdiction against officers but we also think an opportunity should be given to the Centre to showcase the plan to achieve the 700 MT target for Delhi, the Court said. \n\"As a good faith measure, we allow centre to submit a plan by 10.30 am tomorrow,\" it added. \nDuring the hearing, the Court cited the success of Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) in handling the pandemic situation in Mumbai, and asked the Centre to hold a meeting with municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal to adopt similar measures in Delhi. \n\"Until this exercise is complete, Delhi must have a hoarding of 700 MT. You can tell us by 3 pm how much will you go up to till midnight today. We need to inch as close a possible to 700 MT and not be at 550 MT as stated,\" the Court further ordered. \nSolicitor General (SG) Tushar Mehta, representing the Central government, maintained that the case is not an adversarial litigation. \n\"I must point out it is not adversarial. it's not Centre vs Delhi NCT. We owe a responsibility to the citizens.\"\nSG Mehta went on to inform the Bench that the Centre was in the process of providing 700 metric tonne (MT) of oxygen to Delhi, and that yesterday, it had provided 585 MT. Thus, there is no non-compliance with the Supreme Court and Delhi High Court orders, he said.\nAt this point, Justice Chandrachud pointed out that Additional Solicitor General Chetan Sharma had contended before the Delhi High Court that the Centre did not commit to providing 700 MT to Delhi.\n\"In spirit of coordination, a pan-India solution is needed. We need to have a module or mechanism to come to a formula which can be implemented in all states,\" SG Mehta responded.\nThe law officer said that the Centre has to come up with a formula for oxygen allocation to the whole country.\n\"On-ground medical facilities available will be 505 MT for Delhi and a team has stated that there is no justification for 700 MT. This is based on calculation sheet for states. As per Centre, 8,136 of 16,000 non-ICU beds need oxygen,\" he added. \nJustice Chandrachud responded,\n\"We are not debunking the formula. Entire formula is based on assumption. First is 100 percent ICU beds need oxygen and 50 percent non-ICU beds need oxygen. But it depends on state-wise pandemic scenario. Odisha may be different than Maharashtra. Different states are peaking at different times, so we cannot have a general assessment.\"\nThis court is not here to fault the Centre or States, the Bench added. However, we are of the view of the experience gained, it would be necessary for centre to look at the formula for assessing afresh, it said. \nThe Court also asked for the basis on which the Centre had drawn up the assessments of oxygen requirement for each State.\nJustice Chandrachud also queried about the daily supply of oxygen to Delhi and called for an \"upfront display\" of where oxygen was coming from.\n\"Citizens running from pillar to post can know what is the status. Supply of tankers need to be rationalised today,\" the Court ordered.\n\"Please tell us from today and Monday what modalities will be put in place to secure 700 MT oxygen for Delhi. Rest we can re look at on 10th May,\" said Justice Chandrachud.\nThe Court then asked Additional Secretary of the Union Ministry of Home Affairs Piyush Goyal - who was directed to appear before the Delhi High Court - as to how 700 MT could be provided to Delhi.\nGoyal replied that one of the major oxygen production plants was shut down, and that shortage of containers was a major issue.\nJustice Chandrachud then asked,\n\"Cant we have a steady supply of imports into India till the domestic system is beefed up?\"\nSG Mehta said at this point that Delhi would be able to manage with 500 MT of oxygen.\nHowever, the Court retorted,\n\"At an institutional level, we cannot agree since we said 700 MT...we are answerable to citizens.\"\n\"A particular quantity is ordered and not reflected on ground. Now, Delhi needs 700 and some days after it needs 900 MT. There is a possibility we are wrong, or [Senior Advocate Rahul] Mehra is wrong, or we both are partially wrong, or may be there is a systemic failure at some end,\" Mehta submitted.\nJustice Shah then said,\n\"As common man requirement cannot be static and it will fluctuate depending on patients and hospitals. It cant be based on 1,000 beds etc. we are not concerned with arithmetical calculation...it must reach hospitals and common people. People are dying to lack of oxygen. When will this exercise be done?\"\nEventually the Court passed an order recording the details of Oxygen supply to Delhi as informed by the counsel. \n\"It has been submitted that progressively the Central government has attempted to increase stock of LMO in the country and that 9000 MT is available in the pool for distribution,\" the Court recorded in its order. \nThe Court also noted Solicitor General's submission that if an audit is conducted by expert body, then a scientific assessment can be made for Delhi with regard to the requirements for the national capital, \n\"It has been argued that when Mumbai had an active caseload of 92,000 on April 10 2021, the oxygen consumption was 275 MT. Hence it has been urged that even with 92000 active case Mumbai was able to managed with 275 MT LMO through proper institutional framework.

{"ID": "id_12", "Summary": "The Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court recently held that the Chief Minister (CM) has no independent power assigned under the Maharashtra Rules of Business and Instructions to review or modify the decision taken by the concerned in-charge-minister [Chandrapur District Central Co-operative Bank Ltd. & Anr. v. State of Maharashtra & Ors.]\nSince a minister-in-charge of a department is supposed to function for the concerned department, he is responsible for the affairs of the same and his orders would assume the character of an order passed by the State government, the Court said.\n\"The Chief Minister has no independent power under the Business Rules and Instructions to interfere into the subject which was allocated to the in-charge-minister,\" the Court underlined.\nA bench of Justices Vinay Joshi and Valmiki SA Menezes, therefore, quashed a decision of Chief Minister Eknath Shinde dated November 29, 2022 staying the decision of Minister of Cooperation.\n\"The intervention of the Chief Minister is not authorized under the Business Rules and the Instructions issued thereunder. The intervention of the Chief Minister is wholly unwarranted and without the authority of law,\" the Court held.\nThe Court was hearing a plea filed by Chandrapur District Central Co-operative Bank assailing a decision by CM Shinde in November 2022 to stay an order of the Minister of Co-operation which had allowed commencement of the recruitment process for the Bank.\nThe co-operative bank has 93 branches across Chandrapur district in Maharashtra. \nDue to several retirements over the years, the board of directors in November 2021, decided to take steps to fill up such vacancies. \nAfter the necessary initial approvals, the bank published an advertisement for recruitment. \nThe bank claimed in its plea that its chairman's political opponent, who is a lawmaker, made allegations of corruption with regard to the recruitment process.\nThe bank then received a communication from the Co-operation department about stay in the recruitment process. \nIn response, the bank addressed a representation to the Minister of Co-operation, who after due consideration, vacated the stay on November 23, 2022.\nThis order of the in-charge minister was thereafter stayed by the CM, which came to be challenged by the bank by way of the present plea.\nThe Court noted that CM was not the head of the co-operation department, and that a separate minister had been assigned to the department. \n“There is no authority/ power vested in CM as per Rules of Business and Instructions to have supervisory powers over the decision taken by the concerned Minister. Nor do the Rules indicate that the Minister is subordinate to the Chief Minister as regards independent functioning of a department assigned to him by the Rules,” the Court reasoned. \nHence, the Court allowed the plea and quashed the stay order of the CM.\n\"We hold that the Chief Minister has no independent power assigned under the Rules of Business and Instructions issued thereunder to review or modify the decision taken by the concerned in-charge-minister, therefore, the impugned order of stay granted by the Chief Minister would not stand on this legal touchstone.

{"ID": "id_1200", "Summary": "The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld key provisions of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (IBC), which had been challenged on various grounds including alleged absence of due process and a violation of natural justice principles. \nA bench of Chief Justice of India (CJI) DY Chandrachud with Justices JB Pardiwala and Manoj Misra pronounced the judgment in a batch of over 200 petitions challenging Sections 95(1), 96(1), 97(5), 99(1), 99(2), 99(4), 99(5), 99(6), and 100 of the IBC. \nThe Court today rejected the challenge and reasserted that the IBC was constitutionally valid and that its provisions did not suffer from arbitrariness as contended by the petitioners. \n\"IBC cannot be held to be operating in a retroactive manner in order to hold it violative of the constitution. Thus we hold that the statute does not suffer from the vices of manifest arbitrariness,\" the Court ruled. \nPertinently, the Court rejected prayers that there should be some form of an adjudicatory process (whether the corporate debtor is also heard) before the appointment of a resolution professional (RP) under Section 97 of the IBC.\n\"We are of the view that the argument that an adjudicatory role be imposed before Section 97 cannot be accepted ... We have come to the conclusion that reading an adjudicatory role in section 97 will render Section 99 and Section 100 of the IBC otiose,\" the Court held. \nThe bench opined that it would be impermissible for the Court to accept an argument there is an element of adjudication at the stage of appointment of an RP by the adjudicating authority. True adjudication only begins at the stage of Section 100 (admission or rejection of application) of the IBC, the Supreme Court explained. \n\"(For the) Court to enter here will be to rewrite the statute. What is described as a jurisdiction question is not a simple matter of law to be decided as urged by the petitioner,\" the Court's judgment added.\nThe Court further observed that the timelines made part of the Code will be rendered nugatory if any adjudicatory role is read into Section 97 of IBC. \nOther key findings include the following\n1. The Court opined that the application of natural justice principles cannot be viewed in a straightjacket manner, and that its application could vary depending on the situation. \n\"In one case, it can be full fledged evidentiary hearing and in some, a bare minimum is given to explain the nature of allegations,\" the Court explained.\n2. The Court held that sufficient safeguards have been read into the manner in which a resolution professional functions in the course of an insolvency process. \n\"Parliament has not contemplated a roving enquiry by the resolution professional, but an enquiry for recommendation. The resolution professional, after carrying out process, is required to make an ascertainment in terms of clause (6). The process which takes place before the resolution professional is not ex parte and the legislature has ensured that even for a recommendation made, there is explanation taken from the debtor for the purpose,\" the Court said.\n3. The Court also disagreed with arguments by the petitioners that the provisions under challenge conferred \"adjudicatory\" powers on resolution professionals appointed under the IBC.\n\"The role under Section 99 which is ascribed to the resolution professional is that of a facilitator who has to gather relevant information and recommend acceptance or rejection of application. (It) leaves no manner of doubt that resolution professional is not intended to perform an adjudicatory function or to arrive at binding decisions on facts and it is only a recommendation which has no binding force,\" the Court said. \n4. The Court agreed with submissions made by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta on behalf the Central government that the IBC provisions imposing a stay on other legal proceedings against corporate debtors was for the benefit of the debtors. \n\"The moratorium is primarily in respect of a debt as opposed to a debtor ... Purpose of moratorium under Section 96 is protective and Solicitor General was correct that moratorium was to insulate the corporate debtor from the legal action of the debt,\" the Court said. \n5. The Court went on to acknowledge that there were differences with respect to when the resolution professional and the adjudicating authority steps in, and when a moratorium on other legal proceedings is imposed under Parts II (corporate insolvency) and III (insolvency of individuals and partnerships) of the IBC. However, the Court opined that such differential treatment is justified and based on intelligible differentia. \n\"The legislature has carefully calibrated the role of resolution professional, imposition of moratorium and the stage at which adjudicating authority steps in Part II and Part III and this is based on intelligible differentia between the individual debtors, partnerships and corporate debtors,\" the Court said. \nBackground\nThe petitioners, which included Reliance ADA Group chairman Anil Ambani, argued that the IBC was in the teeth of the cardinal principle of natural justice and was thus, arbitrary and violative of the petitioner's fundamental rights under Article 14 of the Constitution of India.\nThe business tycoon's plea challenged Sections 95 (application by creditor to initiate insolvency resolution process), 96 (interim-moratorium), 97 (appointment of resolution professional), 99 (submission of report by resolution professional), 100 (admission or rejection of application) of the Code.\nThat petition contended that the provisions are manifestly arbitrary, unconstitutional, and violative of fundamental rights. It was submitted that they arbitrarily vest unfettered powers in the resolution professional to be a judge in his own cause.\nAdditionally, it was stated that a personal guarantor is left remediless and at the resolution professional's mercy. \nNotably, in May 2021, the top court had upheld the provisions of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code relating to insolvency of personal guarantors, that were brought into force in 2019.\nMeanwhile, the Central government defended the IBC provisions, contending that proceedings under Sections 95-99 cause no real prejudice to personal guarantors.\nFurther, the role of the resolution professional is a limited one under Section 99, only being required to place evidence before the Adjudicating Authority. Nothing gives the former any authority to control or own the assets of the debtor during the interim moratorium, the Central government had stressed.\nThe professional, thus, does not have unfettered powers, as the personal guarantor can always seek a copy of the report submitted by them to the adjudicating authority (National Company Law Tribunals), it was pointed out. \nA resolution professional's recommendation was also not binding on the adjudicating authority, it was submitted. \nThe Central government further contended that the intent of Section 96 was to protect the interests of the personal guarantor by preserving their assets, to alleviate them from short-term financial hardship.\nIn its counter-affidavit, the Central government had also submitted that there was no duplication of recovery proceedings against the personal guarantor under the provisions of the Recovery Of Debts And Bankruptcy Act, 1993 and the SARFAESI Act."}
{"ID": "id_1201", "Summary": "While the reservation system was meant to be a temporary measure to cover the infancy period of Independent India, it is now being endlessly extended and thereby running counter to the object of eliminating caste distinctions, the Madras High Court said on Wednesday (DMK v.

The State was, in any event, planning the same, the order records.\nIn 2019, the Bihar Government announced its intention to demolish the building to free up space for a new government complex. The decision met with wide disapproval and campaigns against the tearing-down of the structure. \nThe petitioner, the Indian National Trust For Art and Cultural Heritage, had earlier filed two PILs challenging the decision to take down the building. In partial relief, on the second PIL, the Court had restrained the State from initiating the demolition of the structure. \nThe Court had also directed the Bihar Urban Arts and Heritage Committee to take a decision on whether the building needed to be preserved. The said Committee, in its report, found the historical value of the building to be insignificant.\nIn the present case, the Committee's constitution was challenged, along with the State's action, which was argued to be arbitrary and capricious. \nThe Patna High Court found the Committee to be lawfully constituted, staffed with Secretaries from the Art, Culture, Youth, Tourism, and Archaeological Departments. \nThe Bihar Urban Planning Act, upon which the challenge was based, required members of the commission to represent \"among others\", Urban Planning, Visual arts, Architecture, Indian History or Archaeology, Tourism and the Environmental Sciences.\nAs for the contention that the building's historical significance was not considered, the Court observed that the Archaeological Survey of India has not assailed the Government's decision to demolish the structure.\nTaking note of the Committee's findings, which reported that the building was totally dilapidated, beyond repair and has no historical importance or significance, the Court dismissed the plea.\nThe petitioner association was represented by Advocate Sanket.

{"ID": "id_1205", "Summary": "While society should be protected from drug-related crimes, the manner of investigating and prosecuting such offences must remain fair, the Kerala High Court recently observed [Raveedranath v State of Kerala].\nJustice N Nagaresh made the observation while setting aside a man’s (appellant) sentence and conviction under Section 22(c) (punishment for possessing a commercial quantity of drugs) of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 (NDPS Act).\n“Indeed, there is a need to protect society from criminals pedaling in narcotic drugs. The societal interest and safety will suffer if persons who commit crime are let off because the evidence against them is to be treated as if it does not exist,” the Court said.\nThe Court, however, further noted that the manner in which drug traffickers are proceeded against must remain \"above board.\"\n\"The remedy cannot be worse than the disease itself. The legitimacy of judicial process may come under cloud if the court is seen to condone acts of lawlessness conducted by the investigating agency during search operations,\" the Court explained. \nThe High Court was considering an appeal filed challenging a session court’s decision to convict the appellant and sentence him to rigorous imprisonment of ten years for allegedly possessing a commercial quantity of drugs. \nThe prosecution claimed that the appellant was found in possession of various narcotics, including Phenergan, Lupigesic, Diazepam IP, and Buprenorphine IP following a body search conducted in 2006.\nThe accused-appellant, however, argued that the search was conducted illegally and in violation of Section 50 (conditions under which search of persons shall be conducted) of the NDPS Act.\nNotably, the body search is said to have been conducted after obtaining consent from the appellant through a communication written in English. The appellant claimed that he only knew Tamil, while the prosecution claimed that the appellant had responded in English.\nThe appellant, however, highlighted that the alleged letter of consent was not produced in the evidence before the trial court. \nThe appellant also contended that the sessions court was wrong to opine that compliance with Section 50 of the NDPS Act was not necessary when the seizure was from a handbag rather than the body.\nHe argued that the police testimony in the case was unreliable and urged the High Court to give him the benefit of the doubt.\nAfter considering rival contentions, the High Court opined that the search violated Section 50 of the NDPS Act and could not be used to prove any unlawful possession of drugs by the appellant.\n“In the present case, the sole allegation against the appellant is that he was found in possession of illicit narcotic drugs / psychotropic substances. An illicit article seized from the person of an accused during a search conducted in violation of the safeguards provided in Section 50 of the Act cannot be used as evidence of proof of unlawful possession of the contraband by the accused though any other material recovered during that search may be relied upon by the prosecution in other proceedings against the accused,” the Court said.\nThe High Court added that the failure to produce the written communication (the English letter) concerning the search also raised serious doubts about the legality of the search and seizure.\nThe Court proceeded to opine that the appellant's conviction could not be justified in such circumstances. \nTherefore, the High Court set aside the appellant's conviction and sentence under Section 22(c) of the NDPS Act and allowed the appeal. \nThe appellant was represented by advocate Manu Roy."}

This is serious matter and definitely caused mental cruelty to husband,\" the bench said.\nIn the present case, the husband filed a custody petition in the family court at Jabalpur seeking custody of his minor child after the wife allegedly obstructed his access to their daughter. On May 18, 2017, the court granted his petition. \nAdditionally, in the divorce proceedings, the court repeatedly ordered the wife to produce their daughter so the father could meet her. In 2020, the family court noted the wife's reluctance to facilitate meetings between the daughter and her father.\nInitially, the appellant-husband filed a divorce petition for mental cruelty and desertion in district court.

They separated in 2020.\nThe husband sought a decrease in the maintenance amount payable for the child, whereas the wife demanded maintenance of ₹2 lakh for her own support. The wife also urged the High Court to increase in the child's maintenance from ₹40,000 to ₹60,000 per month.\nThe Court observed that both the wife and the husband held high qualifications. The wife's monthly salary was ₹2.5 lakhs, while the husband's earnings were $ 7,134 per month which, when converted to Indian rupees, amounted to a sum equivalent to the wife's income, the Court noted further.\n“Though the husband may be earning in dollars, but it cannot be overlooked that his expenditure is also in dollars. He has explained that he has a monthly expense of about USD 7000 and is left with little money for saving.

{"ID": "id_1216", "Summary": "The Delhi High Court on Friday ordered journalists Tarun Tejpal, Aniruddha Bahal and Mathew Samuel and news platform Tehelka to pay ₹2 crore in damages to former Army officer, Major General MS Ahluwalia for defamation [Maj Gen MS Ahluwalia v M/s Tehelka.com & Ors].\nThe order was passed nearly 22 years after Tehelka did a sting operation, known as Operation West End in the year 2001 alleging that Ahluwalia was involved in taking bribes in the defence deals. It was telecast on Tehelka.com and Zee TV Network.\nFollowing the sting operation, a court of inquiry was held which recommended Ahluwalia’s dismissal from service. However, the then Army Chief, in his discretion, awarded him “severe displeasure (recordable)” and he was held to be \"unbecoming of an army officer\".\nIn a detailed order, Justice Neena Bansal Krishna said that Tehelka and its journalists defamed Ahluwalia because he had never demanded any money; yet comments to this effect were shown in the news reports. \nThe Court said that the apology in this case has now become irrelevant as he already suffered the Court of Inquiry and was declared \"unbecoming of an army officer\". \n“The reputation of the plaintiff has suffered as he not only faced lowering of estimation in the eyes of public but his character also got maligned with serious allegations of corruption which no subsequent refutation can redress or heal. Much time has passed and plaintiff has already lived with ill fame for more than 23 years. Considering the enormity of the nature of defamation, apology at this stage is not only inadequate but is meaningless,” the Court said.\nAhluwalia had approached the Court in 2002 arguing that Tehelka’s video tape as well as transcript created an impression that he demanded Blue Label Whisky and ₹10 lakh from the reporter. The allegations sullied his image, cast aspersions on his character and reputation and his plea of innocence went unheard.\nThe plaintiff asserted that the allegations in the video were false, motivated, mischievous and done deliberately without ascertaining the true facts. He added that the video was tampered with and doctored to manipulate the recording and selective portions had been deleted and editorial comments had been added which were not substantiated by facts.\nThe news was picked up by most of the TV channels and print media. However, before the Army’s Court of Inquiry, Samuel (who was the author of the news in Tehelka) gave an exculpatory statement that Ahluwalia never demanded any money and had even refused to attend the dinner to be hosted in a five-star hotel or accept any other hospitality.\nIn fact, Ahluwalia’s statement, “I am only giving you a word of advice as a friend” was deleted from the video.\nAfter considering the case, Justice Krishna noted that there was neither any demand made by the plaintiff nor any money was paid to him and despite this, the news item contained the comments to this effect.\nThese statements were figments of imagination of the defendants, the Court added.\n“The plaintiff was a man holding the position of Major General in the Army and was a man of repute. There cannot be worse defamation and disrepute to a person of integrity and honour than a false imputation of him having demanded and then accepted bribe of ₹50,000. There was wide publicity of this transcript which was admittedly put on the website of Tehelka.com, Defendant No. 1. and it continues to remain on their website,” the Bench said.\nIt added,\n“The comments added by defendant no. 3 [Aniruddha Bahal] are per se false and defamatory to the knowledge of defendants No.1 to 4 [Tehelka, Tejpal, Bahal and Samuel]. There cannot be any more blatant case of causing serious harm and injury to the reputation of an honest Army Officer, who despite all the endeavours of defendant, had refused to accept any bribe.”\nJustice Krishna, therefore, concluded that a case of defamation was made out against Tehelka and its journalists and Ahluwalia was entitled to damages.\nThe Court, however, said that the act of defamation on part of Zee and Subhash Chandra was not proved.\n“In view of the findings on issue No.1 and 2, the suit is dismissed against the defendant Nos. 5 to 7 [Zee and Chandra], and the damages in the sum of ₹2,00,00,000/- (Rupees Two Crores) is awarded to the plaintiff to be paid by defendant No.1 to 4 for having caused defamation, along with costs of the suit,\" the Court finally ordered. \nAdvocates Chetan Anand and Akash Srivastava appeared for Major General MS Ahluwalia.\nTehelka and its journalists were represented through Senior Advocate Meet Malhotra, Vivesh B Saharya, Akshat Agarwal and Palak.\nSenior Advocate Jayant Mehta with advocates Petal Chandhok and Mimansi Sethi appeared for Zee and Subhash Chandra."}

Further, they told the Court that the petitioner had also violated the Transport of Animals Rules and expressed apprehension that if he given custody of the cows, he may once again commit the same offence.\nThe original complainant stated that the cows, all below 10 years of age, had their legs tied up in a cruel manner. She informed the court that on inspection by a veterinarian doctor, it was found that they had suffered multiple injuries and that one of them was pregnant.\nTherefore, considering the submissions, the Court observed that the petitioner was prima facie guilty of cruelty to the animals and refused to grant him interim custody.\n\"In case if the petitioner is finally found to be not guilty, then the issue of custody of the cattles will be dealt with in accordance with the concerned Rules and Regulations, but the petitioner is definitely not entitled to interim custody of the cattles.

{"ID": "id_1221", "Summary": "In a unique ruling, the Madras High Court recently accorded an elevated status to the responsibilities of a woman as a homemaker while enhancing the compensation payable to a woman who suffered permanent disabilities following an accident in 2017 (Bhuvaneswari v. Mani and anr). \nJustice SM Subramaniam emphasised that homemakers stand on a higher pedestal than even earning members of the family, if the issue is viewed in a fair manner. In his ruling, the Judge observed, \n\"... in the cases of Homemakers, we cannot forget that the Homemakers are the Nation Builders. They are the sources for making the family happy and happy family alone can constitute a better society and better society can lead the Nation vibrantly. Thus, the Homemakers are not only contributing to their family, but they contributing to the development of our Great Nation. It is realistic, if anyone of the earning member died in the family, there will be an impact. But if the Homemaker died, then the impact would be unmeasurable and the family will become scattered. It would be very difficult to cope up the family.\"\nThe Court was hearing a plea moved by one, Bhuvaneswari who had been awarded a sum of Rs 4,86,000 by the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal for the 60% permanent disability she had suffered following a bus accident in 2017. \nThe Tribunal had fixed a monthly income of Rs 4,500 for Bhuvaneswari, in the absence of any documents to show she was employed. In an appeal moved to enhance the compensation payable, the High Court took critical note of the Tribunal's approach, while also opining that her value as a homemaker ought to have been appreciated by the Tribunal. \nJustice Subramaniam observed that there is a tendency for homemakers to be ill-advised to present themselves as employed and earning in order to obtain compensation in accident cases. \nIdeally, however, the High Court opined that when there is no document to establish employment or income, \"it is to be ascertained whether the woman claimant is the Homemaker and in such circumstances, she must be considered as a Homemaker for the purpose of assessing the quantum of compensation.\"\nAs such, fixing an income of Rs 4,500 per month towards the homemaker-claimant's income is without any basis, the High Court said. It was undoubtedly inadequate and improper, the Court added. \nExplaining that the value of a homemaker outweighs the amount assigned for monthly income by the Tribunal, the High Court said, \n\"The value and importance of the Homemakers in a family had never been undermined by anybody, including the Courts. Performing the job of the Homemaker is a toughest one and the Homemakers are working without any time limits as they are working with love and affection, which can never be expected from an ordinary employee. Therefore, the job of Homemaker can never be compared with employee or employment and the importance and the values are also to be considered by the Courts, while assessing the compensation. The Homemakers are working from early morning till late night and one can experience the hard work being performed by the Homemakers in the houses.\"\nThe Court added that the homemakers duties should be given due weightage in such cases. In cases where the homemaker dies, the \"family will become helpless and undoubtedly, the situation would be worsened\", the Court observed. \nIn this backdrop, Justice Subramaniam emphasised that it is up to the adjudicating authorities to be fair in granting compensation and that there should be no bias in assessing the contributions made by homemakers to their families. \nThe Court, therefore, enhanced the compensation payable to Bhuvaneswari by estimating her monthly income at Rs 9,000 and also by enhancing the compensation payable under the head of pain and suffering. \nDirecting the insurance company to pay an enhanced compensation of Rs.14,07,000 along with interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum, Justice Subramaniam highlighted further that, \n The appellant in the case was represented by Advocate TS Arthanareeswaran.

{"ID": "id_1223", "Summary": "The Supreme Court on Monday ruled that while no individual can be forced to get vaccinated, the current vaccination policy followed by government as regards restrictions imposed on individuals, is not arbitrary [Dr Jacob Puliyel vs Union of India].\nA bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao and BR Gavai held that on the basis of available material, and considering expert views on severe diseases, hospital admissions etc., the current vaccine policy cannot be said to be unreasonable. \n\"This court is satisfied that current vaccine policy cannot be said to be manifestly arbitrary,\" the Court ruled. \nCommunity interest outweighs individual interest, the bench added. \nThe Court, however, made it clear that vaccines cannot be mandatory and no person can be forced to get vaccinated against his or her wishes though the government can regulate the bodily autonomy of individuals. \n\"Considering bodily autonomy, bodily integrity is protected under article 21. No one can be forced to get vaccinated. (But) government can regulate in areas of bodily autonomy,\" the bench said. \nThe Court, however, said that as long as COVID numbers are low, no restriction should be placed on individuals from accessing public areas and the same should be recalled if such restrictions are in place.\n\"Till numbers are low, we suggest that relevant orders are followed and no restriction is imposed on individuals on access to public areas or recall the same if already not done,\" the judgment stated. \nPertinently, the Court ordered that all COVID vaccine trial data including of future trials should be put in public domain subject to protection of privacy of individuals who were subjected to such trials. \n\"Regarding segregation of vaccine trial data, subject to privacy of individuals, all trials conducted and to be subsequently conducted, all data must be made available to the public without further delay,\" the judgment said. \nBelow are the five takeaways from the judgment:\n1. No one can be forced to be vaccinated;\n2. Central government directed to make public adverse effects of vaccination;\n3. Current COVID vaccination policy is not unreasonable or arbitrary;\n4. Vaccine trial data should be put in public domain;\n5. Court cannot second guess scientific or expert opinion. \nOn the aspect of bodily autonomy the court has noted that \"bodily integrity is protected under Article 21 of the Constitution of India and no individual can be forced to be vaccinated\". \nFurther the court stated that Personal autonomy of an individual involves the right of an individual to determine how they should live their own life, which consequently encompasses the right to refuse to undergo any medical treatment in the sphere of individual health.\nHowever, on the aspect of regulation, the top court has held that government can regulate such bodily autonomy if the person is a threat to others.\n\"If there is a likelihood of such individuals spreading the infection to other people or contributing to mutation of the virus or burdening of the public health infrastructure, thereby affecting communitarian health at large, protection of which is undoubtedly a legitimate State aim of paramount significance in this collective battle against the pandemic, the Government can regulate such public health concerns by imposing certain limitations on individual rights that are reasonable and proportionate to the object sought to be fulfilled,\" reads the judgment. \nThe judgment was delivered on a petition filed by Dr. Jacob Puliyel, former member of the National Technical Advisory Group, seeking disclosure of clinical trial data of COVID vaccines and a declaration that making vaccination mandatory is unconstitutional.\nHe prayed for a declaration that mandating vaccination for COVID, in any manner whatsoever, even by way of making it a precondition for accessing any benefits or services, is a violation of rights of citizens and unconstitutional.\nThe plea also alleged that the vaccines currently being administered have not been adequately tested for safety or efficacy are now licensed under emergency use authorisation without the data being disclosed to the public.\n\"In India, the manner in which the vaccines have been licensed vitiates and even precludes the possibility that the vaccines can be evaluated objectively in the future,\" the petition had stated.\nThe petitioner and handful of others like him would be enabled to create serious misgivings and misconceived doubts against the vaccination, it was argued.\nAdvocate Guru Krishna Kumar for Bharat Biotech, the makers of Covaxin, had submitted that the allegation of Phase III trial data not being published was incorrect.\n\"This is an attempt to release a cat among the pigeons\" the counsel argued.\nCounsel for the Serum Insitute of India, which produces and markets Covishield vaccine, submitted that the matter is infructuous and all necessary data was already with the regulators.\nRebutting these arguments, advocate Prashant Bhushan, representing the petitioner, had contended that a vaccinated person transmits the virus as much as an unvaccinated.\n\"If I am COVID recovered and vaccinated even then I will be at equal risk of transmitting it to others, if i am infected again. If vaccination is not helping in reducing the transmission, then it is my decision to get vaccinated or not. It is my decision and it is my life. Serological survey shows that more than 80 percent of Delhi's population have had the infection. Mere assertion by the govt is not enough if I have produced evidence. Vaccine mimics a natural infection. There is no scientific journal in this world which disputes this proposition.\"\nBhushan also alleged regularities regarding the grant of emergency use authorisation to Covaxin, adding that there have been adverse effects to the vaccine.\n\"It is very clear from data that the people who have had infection is immune to reinfection. Vaccine is only mimicking a part of the virus and when you get the whole infection, you have the whole virus and thereby you develop all necessary anti bodies.\"\nSolicitor General (SG) Tushar Mehta, representing the Central government, had argued that the government was only trying to encourage vaccination, and that the petitioner's stand may be to the detriment of others as it will lead to vaccine hesitancy.\nThe SG had pointed out that clinical data and vaccine vial monitors are updated on a real-time basis and vaccines stored safely in cold storage.\nThe Central government contended that the plea goes against national interest and would violate the rights of citizens to get vaccinated against the virus.\nIn its affidavit, the Central government said that the petition directly harms public interest.\n\"At this juncture, the entire concentration of the Central Government and the State Governments should be and is on vaccination drive and encouraging people to get them vaccinated. It is, therefore, not desirable at this juncture to invest time finding out motives behind few elements attempting to act against the interest of nation at the cost of violating the right of crores of citizens to be protected from pandemic,\" the Central government had said in its affidavit.\nThe top court had during one of the previous hearings made clear that adjudicating the matter cannot be construed as a signal that it does not trust the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines. It had nevertheless sought the Central government's response.\n(Read Judgment)\nBREAKING: #VaccineMandate case#SupremeCourt holds:1. No one can be forced to be vaccinated2.

To take a contrary view can also be seen to amount to unjustifiably suspecting a person of interference due to his occupation without any evidence and would result in doing injustice to him, in a zeal to appear just,” the Court said.\nIt added,\n“To state that only because the brother of the victim is a judicial officer, the accused is not getting bail due to some influence without any iota of evidence in this regard is preposterous. Accepting this argument will be equivalent to accepting that a judicial officer in case of being victimized or being hurt or cheated as a family member, as in this case being the biological brother of the complainant, does not have fundamental right to get justice for himself, his family or his immediate kith and kin.”\nThe Court stressed that judges also care about their reputation and by disclosing the victim and the judicial officer’s identity, it is the accused who is trying to take advantage of the judicial system.\nIt noted that even the trial court had cautioned the counsel against revealing the identity of the victim and her brother, who is a judge.\nThe Court, therefore, directed the registry to ensure that henceforth, in any petitions/applications filed in cases involving sexual offences, a certificate/note be annexed with the first page of the petition certifying that the name of the complainant or any other name has not been mentioned.\nThe main accused Ravi Gautam had befriended the complainant on a matrimonial website and got married to her. However, it was later revealed that Gautam was already married.\nThe bail applicant Mohit Pilania was booked for being an accomplice.\nAfter considering the case, the Court concluded that Pilania was the teacher of the main accused and had allegedly conspired with him to cheat the complainant and her family.\n“The charges against the present accused have already been framed, and the complainant is yet to be examined before the learned Trial Court. The allegations against the applicant/accused are very grave and serious in nature.

The same would imply that an injured person who has his or her complaint prepared by a lawyer will be at better footing, than a lawyer himself who has suffered injuries on the vital part of the body,\" the Court explained.\nThe First Information Report (FIR) against the accused was registered under sections 323 (Voluntarily causing hurt), 341 (Wrongful restraint) and 34 (Acts done in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).\nAs per the FIR, a verbal altercation took place between the complainant and his cousin, and the accused and the co-accused, over an issue of weight of chicken purchased by the complainant from the accused.\nThe prosecution claimed that post the altercation, the complainant went home and returned with his brother and friend, to sort out the issue. However, a physical tussle ensued during which the complainant was hit on the head with an iron rod by the accused persons. He fell unconscious and was treated at AIIMS trauma centre. \nDuring the course of investigation, discharge summary, X-rays and MLCs were obtained, pursuant to which Section 308 (attempt to commit culpable homicide) IPC was added to the FIR.\nThe counsel for the applicant contented that the complainant, being a lawyer who was familiar with the nuances of writing a complaint, had twisted the facts to compel the police to register a complaint.\nThey claimed that the complainant pressurized him to sell chicken to him at a lower price than the market price, which the applicant did to avoid an altercation. However, the complainant allegedly returned with 20-25 people, who slapped the applicant and pulled his hair, after which the applicant, in self defence, pushed the complainant who got injured after his head hit a marble slab.\nThey further claimed that the complainant took ₹15,000 from the accused's shop, for which a complaint was lodged on which no action was taken. They also stated that section 308 was added to the FIR only nine days after it was registered.\nOn the other hand, Assistant Public Prosecutor Manoj Pant argued that the allegations were serious in nature and custodial interrogation of the accused was necessary to apprehend other accused persons and for recovery of the weapon of offence.\nThe counsel for the complainant stated that the complainant was hit on the head with an iron rod and gave his statement only when he was declared fit, subsequent to which section 308 was added to the FIR. \nThe Court accepted the submission and also recorded that the trial court had already sought an explanation from the SHO concerned on the issue.\nAfter rejecting the argument that the lawyer got the complaint registered owing to his knowledge of the law and by twisting facts, the Court observed that if a person with a skill is able to help others, the skill cannot work to his disadvantage.\n\"If a person has a position of authority or skill and he is able to help others, then in his own case, his own skill, profession or position of authority cannot work to his disadvantage,\" the Court said.\nFurther, it said that it was not the complainant's profession, but the fact that he was injured, which helped the Court in deciding the application as the evidence revealed that the complainant had suffered a serious injury in form of a laceration on the forehead.

The CBI has submitted a preliminary inquiry and the Lokpal has to take a decision as to whether to proceed further in the case or not.\"\nThe Court then proceeded to dispose of the plea. \nSoren, who is now a Rajya Sabha Member of Parliament (MP), had approached the Court challenging the proceedings before the Lokpal and its order dated August 4, 2022, through which proceedings were directed to be initiated to determine whether a prima facie case exists to proceed further against him.\nHis plea argued that this order was passed without considering Soren’s objections that no inquiry could be conducted against him because the complaint had been filed more than seven years after the alleged incident. Section 53 of the Lokpal and Lokayukta Act 2013 bars such investigation after the expiry of the limitation period, Soren argued.\nThe plea further said that proceedings before the Lokpal have been registered pursuant to a complaint dated August 5, 2020, and that although the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) commenced a preliminary enquiry sometime in July 2021 against Soren, his wife and their children, no copy of the complaint was provided to Soren till the end of February 2022.\nSoren also challenged the Lokpal’s order of September 2020 through which the Lokpal directed the CBI to conduct a preliminary inquiry against Soren and submit a report.\nThe allegations against Soren are that he amassed huge wealth, properties and assets by adopting unscrupulous and corrupt means in the State of Jharkhand over a period of more than ten years.\nThe assets, it is alleged, are not only in his own name but even in the names of his family members including sons, daughters, daughter-in-law, friends and various companies in various districts of Jharkhand, such as Ranchi, Dhanbad and Dumka etc. \nThe JMM patriarch has termed the allegations and the complaint mischievous, false, frivolous and motivated and a rambling yarn spun by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP Nishikant Dubey.\n“No instance of even a single specific purported act of corruption is alleged in the Complaint.

However, the ultimate decision on whether or not to accept the advice of the Governor as contained in the message belongs to the legislature alone.\"\nThe judgment cautioned against casting doubt on the power of the Punjab Assembly Speaker to convene a special session in continuation of an earlier one that was not prorogued, but adjourned indefinitely.\n\"Any attempt to cast doubt on the session of the legislature would be replete with grave perils to democracy. The Speaker who has been recognized to be a guardian of the privileges of the House and the constitutionally recognized authority who represents the House, was acting well within his jurisdiction in adjourning the House sine die.\"\nOn the expression \"as soon as possible\" in Article 200 of the Constitution, which mandates a Governor to either give his assent to a bill or return it to the legislature expeditiously, the Court held,\n\"The expression “as soon as possible” is significant. It conveys a constitutional imperative of expedition. Failure to take a call and keeping a Bill duly passed for indeterminate periods is a course of action inconsistent with that expression. Constitutional language is not surplusage...The Governor cannot be at liberty to keep the Bill pending indefinitely without any action whatsoever.\"\nThus, the Governor cannot be allowed to 'virtually veto' the functioning of the elected legislature by simply declaring that assent is withheld without any further recourse.\n\"Such a course of action would be contrary to fundamental principles of a constitutional democracy based on a Parliamentary pattern of governance,\" the Court added.\nThe Supreme Court had on November 10 ordered Punjab Governor Banwarilal Purohit to decide on the bills submitted before him by the State legislature for his assent.\nGovernor Purohit and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government have been at loggerheads over the extended Budget Session that was held between March 3 and March 22.\nWhile a two-day special session was held in June, another session called on October 20 and 21 was cut short after Purohit called it illegal and withheld approvals for the introduction of three money bills. \nThe four bills passed during the special session held in June have also not been approved by the Governor. In this backdrop, the Punjab government approached the Supreme Court for relief.\nThe State government urged the top court to declare that the legislative assembly sessions called in June and October were legal and that the business carried out during these sessions was legal.\nMeanwhile, the three money bills pending before the Governor were cleared for introduction earlier this month, after the filing of the petition before the top court.\nThe trend of acrimony over delayed assent to bills is on the rise, with the governments of Kerala and Tamil Nadu also moving the Supreme Court in this regard recently."}

The counsel emphasised that it was not supposed to be a bounty.\nAnother issue as to whether brothers and sisters of the victim would be legal heirs, and whether such a wide definition of 'family' should be given was raised.\nIn this regard it was submitted that despite the assurance earlier given, the victim's family did not have any indefeasible and enforceable right with regard to employment.\nThe counsel also opposed the prayer seeking relocation outside Hathras. It was submitted that such reliefs could only be given after the alleged atrocities were proven in trial. \nFurther, it was stated that in a public interest proceeding, the victim's family could not claim redressal of their individual grievance, since it involved complicated factual issues. \nSubmissions by amicus curiae\nThe amicus appointed to assist the court, however, underscored that the term 'victim' under the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act and Rules included dependents and non-dependents.\nTherefore, the stand taken was that the grant of employment was not restricted only to the dependents and there was no reason to give a restrictive meaning to the term 'family'.\nAdditionally, it was stated that the relief sought could be considered by the court since it was not as though the relief was alien to the subject matter in issue.\nFindings of the court\nThe court rejected the State's argument that the family's individual grievances could not be heard for the reason the victim's family belonged to a downtrodden class of society. It was noted that the relief being claimed was an offshoot of the crime committed.\nFurther, the court stressed that the Act was promulgated to prevent the commission of offence of atrocities against the members of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes.\n\"Considering the subject matter it cannot be said that this is purely an individual grievance as the relief sought is one which is claimed by the victim's family as being permissible and which the State is obliged to provide to them under the Act 1989 and the Rules made thereunder.\"\nFurther, the bench expressed its disinclination to make the family instead of making them run from pillar to post. Going on to find that there were no intricate and complex factual issues, the court decided to consider the plea.\nWith regard to the prayer of employment it was found that even without the State's assurance, the family members were entitled to employment. \n\"There is no reason why we should give a restrictive meaning to the term 'relatives' so as to oust brothers and sisters from its purview..,\" the court said.\nIt was clarified that in the event of ambiguity an interpretation advancing the object of the Act should be preferred, and not one which defeats the object of the provisions.\nWhile considering the facts of the case, it was observed that the family was in need of employment, and the promise by the State was not based on whims or fancies. \n\"This is especially as the Act 1989 is itself a legislative measure to protect the rights and the interest of the poorest of poor, the downtrodden, who belong to Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe.\"\nWith this discussion, the State was directed to provide a job suitable to the qualifications of a family member within three months.\n\"We accordingly direct the State Government to consider employment of one of the family member.. This shall be done within three months from the date of receipt of this order.\"\nIn relation to the plea seeking relocation, the division bench considered the social and economic condition of the victim’s family, as well as the mental state in which the family members claimed to be.\nIt was noted that after the incident, considering the limelight, one could very well imagine that it would not be easy for the family to continue to live in the village.\n\"We are of the opinion that the State should consider their relocation to any other place within the State outside Hathras keeping in mind their social and economic rehabilitation and also the educational needs of the children,\" it was thus, held.\nThis decision was directed to be taken within six months.\nAdvocates Abhinav Bhattacharya, Ajit Singh, Anjani Kumar Mishra, Ashish Kumar Agarwal, Atul K Singh, Atul Kumar Singh, Digvijay Singh Yadav, Jaideep Narain Mathur Ac, Nadeem Murtaza, Onkar Singh, Pradeep Kumar Singh, Seema Kushwaha and Sharad Bhatnagar appeared for the petitioners. \nSenior Advocate SV Raju, Advocates Anurag Kumar Singh, Ashok Shukla, Dr Ravi Kumar Mishra, Manjusha, Pranjal Krishna and Satyaveer Singh appeared for the respondents. \nSenior Advocate JN Mathur was appointed the Amicus Curiae and was assisted by Advocate Abhinav Bhattacharya."}

{"ID": "id_1236", "Summary": "The Meghalaya High Court has held that vaccination administered by way of coercive methods vitiates the fundamental purpose of welfare attached to vaccination (Registrar General, High Court of Meghalaya v. State of Meghalaya)\nThus, forcing shopkeepers, vendors, local taxi drivers etc. to get vaccinated as a condition for resuming their business or profession will fall foul of Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution, the Court said. \n“However, vaccination by force or being made mandatory by adopting coercive methods, vitiates the very fundamental purpose of the welfare attached to it. It impinges on the fundamental right(s) as such, especially when it affects the right to means of livelihood which makes it possible for a person to live,\" the judgment stated. \nThe observations were made after it was brought to the notice of the Court that the State, through various orders passed by Deputy Commissioners, had mandated shopkeepers, vendors, local taxi drivers etc. to get themselves vaccinated before resuming their business. \nThe Court discussed two questions in this regard:\nA) Whether vaccination can at all be made mandatory,\nB) Whether such mandatory action can adversely affect the right of a citizen to earn their livelihood.\nAt the outset, the Bench of Chief Justice Biswanath Somadder and Justice HS Thangkhiew noted that vaccination is the need of the hour and absolutely necessary to overcome the pandemic.\nThe Court, however, observed that no action of the State shall be in derogation of the fundamental right to livelihood enshrined under Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution unless it falls within the ambit of reasonable restrictions. \n\"As held in Olga Tellis & Ors vs. Bombay Municipal Corporation, right to life includes right to the means of livelihood. Any action of the State which is in absolute derogation of this basic principle is squarely affected by Article 19(1)(g). Although, Article 19(6) prescribes 'reasonable restrictions' in the 'interest of general public, the present instance is exemplary and clearly distinguishable,” the Court said. \nThe Court relied on judgments more than a century old to establish that a coercive element to vaccination has time and again been discouraged and consistently ruled against by several Courts. \n“Around one hundred and seven (107) years ago, in Schloendroff v Society of New York Hospitals, NY Justice Cardozo ruled that ‘every human being of adult years and sound mind has a right to determine what shall be done with their body’. Thus, by use of force or through deception if an unwilling capable adult is made to have the ‘flu vaccine would be considered both a crime and tort or civil’ wrong, as was ruled in Airedale NHS Trust v Bland reported around thirty years (30) ago.”\nThe Bench also drew a comparison between intrusion to one’s body through a needle to other issues concerning personal and bodily autonomy,\n“Whether to subject oneself to an intrusion of his/her body, even if of minor intensity, e.g., through a needle, concerns issues of personal and bodily autonomy and bodily integrity, similar to abortion rights or non-sterilization rights or even sex reassignment surgeries, irrespective of what consequences the individual might be inviting.”\nFurther discussing the State’s responsibility to disseminate accurate information and avoid spread of misinformation the Court underscored that the burden lies on the State to senisitze citizens about the pros and cons of vaccination. \n“The burden lies on the State to disseminate and sensitize the citizens of the entire exercise of vaccination with its pros and cons and facilitate informed decision making particularly in a situation where the beneficiaries are skeptical, susceptible and belonging to vulnerable/marginalised section of the society, some of whom are also gullible members of the indigenous communities who are constantly being fed with deliberate misinformation regarding the efficacy of vaccination by some persons/organisations with oblique motives.”\nThe Principal Secretary stated that the existing orders on vaccine compliance will be modified, and the requirement of vaccination would be made directory and not mandatory. The Court found this a step in the right direction.\nThe Bench also issued guidelines to ensure that the public at large is able to make an informed choice. \n(i) All shops/establishments/local taxis/auto-rickshaws/maxi cabs and buses should display prominently at a conspicuous place, a sign, “VACCINATED”, in the event all employees and staff of the concerned shop/establishment are vaccinated. Similarly, in the case of local taxis/auto-rickshaws/maxi cabs and buses where the concerned driver or conductor or helper(s) are vaccinated.\n(ii) All shops/establishments/local taxis/auto-rickshaws/maxi cabs and buses should display prominently at a conspicuous place, a sign, “NOT VACCINATED”, in the event all the employees and staff of the concerned shop/establishment are not vaccinated. Similarly, in the case of local taxis/auto-rickshaws/maxi cabs and buses where the concerned driver or conductor or helper(s) are not vaccinated.\nClosure/stoppage of plying was directed for those who flout these guidelines.\nThe matter will be heard again on June 30 for the Court to monitor the issue closely in aiding the State to overcome the problem of vaccine hesitancy."}

They decided what answers to give and the moment they were arrested they started the blame game and passing the buck began\", Thakare submitted.\nReferring to the order passed by bench of Justice Dere releasing co-accused Kochhar, Thakare contended that the arrest after so many years was only because the agency required time to study the huge amount of transactions in the case.\nHe also argued that that if Dhoot and Kochhars would have been arrested in 2019, the agency would have been constrained to file their chargesheet in a rushed manner without being able to properly study the transactions.\nThe Court however was not satisfied with this submission. \n\"There is no satisfactory answer from CBI as to why for a period of 3 years, it had neither confronted all the accused before one another or demonstrated the progress of the investigation by placing the case diary before the remanding Court. Non-compliance of Section 41 and 41A of the CrPC is, therefore, apparent\", the Court concluded."}

The complaints committee being an inquiry authority and in some sense equivalent to a presiding officer of the court ... must be allowed to put questions on its own if a proper, fair and thorough inquiry is to take place,\" the bench observed.\nThe Supreme Court made the observation while setting aside a Gauhati High Court decision, in which the High Court had ruled that certain inquiry proceedings stood vitiated because the Complaints Committee had put questions to the prosecution witnesses.\nDisagreeing with this approach, the top court said:\n\"If the observations of the High Court are accepted, it would lead to a chilling effect, whereby the complaints committee which is deemed to be an inquiry authority would be reduced to a mere recording machine … We fail to understand what other purpose the complaints committee which is deemed to be an ‘inquiry authority’ would serve, if we are to hold that the complaints committee cannot put questions to the witnesses.\"\nIn the same ruling, the Court also emphasised that allowing sexual harassers to evade the law humiliates and frustrates the survivor.\n\"However, at the same time, it should be kept in mind that the charge of this nature is very easy to make and is very difficult to rebut. When a plea is taken of false implication for extraneous reasons, the courts have a duty to make deeper scrutiny of the evidence and decide the acceptability or otherwise of the accusations. Every care should be taken to separate the chaff from the grain,\" the bench added.\nThe apex court further cautioned against misuse of the law under the garb of “sexual harassment” as such a practice makes a mockery of the justice system.\nThe case before the Court concerned a senior officer at the Services Selection Board in Assam. \nA complaint was filed against him by a lady colleague who accused him of sexual harassment. \nInquiries were subsequently conducted, including by a Central Complaints Committee. This Committee eventually found him guilty and recommended that his pension and retiral dues be cut by half as punishment, considering that he had retired during the inquiry proceedings. \nThe accused officer eventually filed an appeal before the Gauhati High Court, which granted him relief. Among other observations, the High Court opined that the Committee had played the role of a prosecutor in a case where there was \"no evidence.\"\nThe High Court verdict was challenged by the Central government through an appeal, which has now been allowed by the Supreme Court. \nThe Supreme Court reiterated that in a disciplinary inquiry, the standard of proof is “preponderance of probabilities” and that courts should only interfere with a disciplinary authority’s findings when they are either perverse or based on no evidence at all.\nIn this case, the Court found that this was not a case of \"no evidence\" and that the complainant's allegations had been substantiated by witnesses.\nTherefore, it allowed the appeal and restored the Complaint Committee's order recommending the penalty on the accused. \nAdvocate K Parameswar appeared for the Central government. Advocate Avijit Roy appeared for the accused."}

Allegations of child abuse are serious allegations and cannot be made without due care and verification. It cannot be based on the opinions of the author,” the Court said.\nJustice Amit Bansal besides ordering take down of the article also restrained Mint, its journalist Shephali Bhatt and editor-chief Shruthijith KK from posting, circulating or publishing the article on any online or offline platform. \nThe Court also directed journalist Abhishek Baxi to take down his tweet regarding the article and to refrain from posting, circulating or publishing any similar defamatory content against Taneja and his wife on any social media or online/offline platform.\n“Undoubtedly, a person has a right to criticize the views expressed by an individual and such criticism would be covered under right to free speech. However, vicious attacks cannot be made on the character of a person under the guise of journalistic freedom and free speech. In my prima facie view, there is nothing in the aforesaid videos to substantiate allegations of child abuse,” the Court said. \nThe Court was dealing with a suit by Taneja and Rathee through advocate Mukesh Sharma seeking permanent injunction against Mint and its journalist with regard to an article that was published on its website on May 8.\nThe article titled “Shouldn’t brands stop supporting sordid influencers?” was based on a picture and caption of a housewarming havan tweeted by Taneja. The picture had Taneja, Rathee and their younger daughter performing the pooja.\nThe tweet read, “Hinduism is a science-based way of life” and that on December 3, 1984 two families remained unaffected by the Bhopal Gas leak because they were performing havan.\n“They performed regular अग्निहोत्र (havan), which is a natural antidote to pollution,” the tweet claimed.\nThe article in Mint also highlighted a video put out by Taneja and it said that \"he is filming Ritu piercing their elder daughter's ears and when the daughter asks him not to \"vlog\" it, he says, \"why not!\" The 10-minute video then goes on to show the daughter howling and writhing in pain while the camera zooms in on her.\"\nA lower court had, in June, rejected Taneja’s defamation suit against Mint and Bhatt.\nThe High Court was told that the article was based on videos posted by the plaintiffs and it made allegations of misogyny, child abuse and abuse of their pet dog.\nIt was further stated that posting of the article as well as tweets has caused immense damage to the reputation of the plaintiff with sponsors.\nJustice Amit Bansal held that in his prima facie view, there was nothing to substantiate allegations of child abuse the journalist may or may not agree with the views of the plaintiffs but the use of terms like terms like ‘dodo’, ‘bewakoof’ and ‘idiocy’, are clearly defamatory in nature and cannot be permitted on a public platform.\n“…this Court finds that the plaintiffs have made a prima facie case in their favour and in case no ad interim injunction is granted to the plaintiffs, irreparable harm and injury would continue to be caused to the plaintiffs. So long as the impugned articles and the impugned tweets continue to be in circulation and visible on social media, they are likely to cause damage to the reputation and career of the plaintiffs. Balance of convenience lies in favour of the plaintiffs,” the Court noted\nThe Court, therefore, directed Mint and its journalist as well as Baxi to take down the article as well as the allegedly defamatory tweets.\nSenior Advocate Percival Billimoria along with advocates Raghav Awasthi, Mukesh Sharma, Archit Singh and Rachita Sood appeared for the plaintiffs.\nAdvocates Naman Joshi, Guneet Sidhu, Yuvraj Francis, Zaheb Hussain, Soutik Banerjee, Harsh Jain, Devika Tulsiani, Mannat Tipnis, Sanjay Kumar, Abishek K Singh and Saurabh Kumar appeared for the defendants."}

{"ID": "id_1244", "Summary": "The Supreme Court on Thursday said that for the purposes of the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, marital rape has to be considered as falling within the meaning of 'rape' in order to save women from forceful pregnancy [X Versus The Principal Secretary Health and Family Welfare Department, Delhi NCT Government and Anr].\nA Bench of Justices DY Chandrachud, AS Bopanna, and JB Pardiwala said that any pregnancy alleged by a pregnant woman to be caused by force is rape notwithstanding the exception to marital rape under Indian Penal Code (IPC). \n\"Notwithstanding Exception 2 to Section 375 of the IPC,85 the meaning of the words “sexual assault” or “rape” in Rule 3B(a) (of MTP Rules) includes a husband’s act of sexual assault or rape committed on his wife. The meaning of rape must therefore be understood as including marital rape, solely for the purposes of the MTP Act and any rules and regulations framed thereunder. Any other interpretation would have the effect of compelling a woman to give birth to and raise a child with a partner who inflicts mental and physical harm upon her,\" the bench observed. \nThe Court emphasised that married woman may also form part of class of survivors. \n\"Rape means sexual intercourse without consent and intimate partner violence is a reality. In this case also woman may get forcefully pregnant,\" the top court said in its judgment. \nThe meaning of rape must, therefore, be understood as including marital rape, for the purpose of the MTP Act and any rules and regulations framed under the Act, the Court underscored.\nThe Court, however, clarified that understanding “rape” under the MTP Act and the rules as including marital rape does not have the effect of striking down Exception 2 to Section 375 of the India Penal Code (IPC) or changing the contours of the offence of rape as defined in the IPC.\n\"Since the challenge to Exception 2 to Section 375 of the IPC is pending consideration before a different Bench of this Court, we would leave the constitutional validity to be decided in that or any other appropriate proceeding,\" the Court said. \nThese observations were made in a judgment that has held that provisions in the MTP Act allowing termination pregnancy beyond 20 weeks and up to 24 weeks cannot be denied to a woman merely because she is unmarried.\nThe three-judge bench held that reproductive autonomy is closely linked to bodily autonomy and consequences of unwanted pregnancy on a woman cannot be undermined.\nThe case arose from a July order in which the Supreme Court had allowed an unmarried woman, who became pregnant due to consensual sex, to abort her 24-week-old foetus.\nThe appellant, hailing from Manipur and currently residing in Delhi, had moved the Delhi High Court after she came to know about her pregnancy.\nThe High Court had refused relief to the woman, holding that an unmarried woman who is carrying a child out of a consensual sexual relationship cannot be permitted to terminate pregnancy older than 20 weeks.\nThe woman then moved the Supreme Court in appeal.\nThe Supreme Court, on July 21, overturned the decision of the Delhi High Court, which had declined to permit the abortion.\nThe Supreme Court while allowing the plea observed that the High Court took an unduly restrictive view in interpreting the MTP Act and Rules.\nAfter allowing the abortion the Court proceeded to hold further hearing on the scope of MTP Act and Rules before delivering its verdict on the same today."}
{"ID": "id_1245", "Summary": "Given that marital rape is not recognised or considered an offence in Indian law, the Chhattisgarh High Court recently discharged a man from facing trial for rape on a complaint by his wife (Dilip Pandey and ors v. State of Chhattisgarh).\nJustice NK Chandravanshi noted that Exception 2 to Section 375 (which defines the offence of \"rape\") of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) lays down that \"Sexual intercourse or sexual acts by a man with his own wife, the wife not being under fifteen years of age, is not rape.\"\nThe Court noted that this provision makes it clear that sexual intercourse or a sexual act by a man with his own wife (not being a minor) is not rape. The Court ruled, \n\"In this case, complainant is legally wedded wife of applicant No. 1, therefore, sexual intercourse or any sexual act with her by the applicant No. 1/husband would not constitute an offence of rape, even if it was by force or against her wish.\"\nAs such, a charge framed against the husband under Section 376, IPC was held to be erroneous and illegal.\n\"Hence, he is entitled to be discharged from the charge under Section 376 of the I.P.C\", the Court said. \nHowever, charges framed in the case under Sections 498A (relating to cruelty to women) against the husband and his family members and 377 (unnatural offences, carnal intercourse against the \"order of nature\") were sustained. \nThe Court was hearing a criminal revision plea moved by the husband and his family members challenging the framing of all these charges on a complaint by the first applicant's wife. \nThe wife had alleged that days after her marriage, she was subjected to cruelty, abuse and dowry harassment. Among other allegations, she also alleged that her husband had inserted his fingers and radish in her vagina, despite her protest and that he had had unnatural physical relations with her. Efforts to settle the dispute were in vain, the Court was told.\nFinding no infirmity in the charge framed under Section 377 IPC, the Court said, \n\"... where dominant intention of the offender is to derive unnatural sexual satisfaction, repeatedly insert any object in the sex organ of the victim and consequently derives sexual pleasure, such act would constitute as a carnal intercourse against the order of nature and such act would attract the ingredient of offence under Section 377 of the I.P.C.\"\nTo sustain the charges framed under Section 498A, IPC, the Court noted that there were written reports and statements by the complainant-wife about the cruelty she faced, which were supported by her parents. \n\"Those facts have also been stated by their neighbouring witnesses in their police statements. Therefore, I do not find any infirmity in framing charges under Section 498-A/34 of the I.P.C. against the applicants,\" the Court said. \nOn a related note, the Kerala High Court recently ruled that while marital rape is not a criminal offence under Indian law, it amounts to cruelty and can, therefore, entitle a wife to divorce.\nSexual intercourse by husband not rape, even if it was by force or against wife's wish: Chhattisgarh High Court#Rape #MaritalRape #ChhattisgarhHighCourt@meera_emmanuel reportsRead full story: https://t.co/SYXMBxSn7T pic.twitter.com/aCgn0ToaCg"}

The Family Court while granting the interim custody to the minor daughter has taken care to ensure that the visitation and access rights of the Petitioner-father are well protected.

He said that his daughter was extremely attached to his parents and extended family, and that the house was close to her school and other extra-curricular activities. He also claimed that the atmosphere at the mother’s house was not conducive to the child’s welfare.\nFurther, he referred to the notes addressed to him by his daughter expressing her wish to stay with him.\nThe Court, however, concluded that the family court had balanced the rights of both parties, after considering the overall welfare of the child. \nAfter interacting with the child in her chambers, Justice Deshmukh opined that at the age of 8 years, the child was not mature enough to know where her welfare lay. \nThe Court also opined that the allegations of adultery against the mother had not been conclusively established, and that the father was not able to prove that living with the mother would be detrimental to the moral and ethical welfare of the child. \n“The child has been shifted from her father’s house, where she was residing since her birth to her mother’s house and it will take some time for the child to adapt to the new surroundings.

As such, there is nothing to warrant the withdrawal of prosecution to ensure public justice, the Court said.\nIt, therefore, dismissed the plea\nPertinently, the accused including Mohanlal were directed to appear before the court on November 3. \nBackground\nThe case against Mohanlal relates to the alleged illegal possession of two pairs of ivory tusks which resulted in the registration of a first information report (FIR) alleging the commission of offences under the provisions of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972.\nMohanlal maintained that the ivory tusks were obtained legally and that in 2015, at the direction of the Central government, the Kerala government had issued a certificate of ownership to him.\nSubsequently, the State government issued a no objection certificate for withdrawing the case against him.\nHowever, in June 2022, a magistrate court dismissed the State's application to withdraw the case. \nBoth the actor and the State moved the High Court against this order.\nOn February 22 this year, the High Court dismissed this plea by Mohanlal and the State. However, the High Court partially allowed the State's petition by asking the magistrate to consider the State's plea afresh.\nThis led to the State approaching the magistrate with a fresh plea to withdraw the case.\nIn this plea, the Assistant Public Prosecutor submitted that the ownership certificate issued to the Mohanlal on December 12, 2015, was on the basis of a declaration made as per Section 40(4) of the Wild Life (Protection) Act. \nHe submitted that since the State government granted an ownership certificate, the possession was now justified by law irrespective of whether it was legal or illegal.\nThe Court was also told that since the original source of the tusks was an individual, the element of public interest is comparatively less.\nThe Assistant Public Prosecutor added that there was an unexplained inordinate delay in filing the occurrence report in this case, indicating that the prosecution was earlier initiated as an afterthought.\nThe Court said that since the investigation and prosecution were the prerogatives of the State, no one else can be found to be at fault for the inordinate delay in the proceedings.\n“This court is of the view that no party including State can claim the benefit of the laches from their side,\" the court added.\nThe Court proceeded to dismiss the plea filed by the State."}

Pending the inquiry, it has requested that the matter should not be heard by the Court.\n“Till the inquiry is made, seek appropriate directions from either Hon’ble the Chief Justice of India or from the Hon’ble Court hearing the matter not to allow further hearing in the matter,” it further states.\nThe Supreme Court Rules state that no application would be entertained where the review of a judgment or order is sought.\nThe letter also underscores that in the past, the practice had been of the registry straightaway rejecting such applications without placing them before the Court.\nIn 2019, a similar issue was raised by Dave, who alleged that two cases involving Adani Group’s companies were listed out of turn by the Supreme Court during the Court's summer vacation of 2019 and disposed of in contravention to the settled practice and procedure of the apex court."}

{"ID": "id_1255", "Summary": "The Supreme Court on Tuesday held that school transfer certificate cannot be the basis to determine age of a person under the Juvenile Justice Act (JJ Act) [P Yuvaprakash vs State Rep by Inspector of Police]. \nA bench of Justices S Ravindra Bhat and Aravind Kumar held that as per Section 94 of the Juvenile Justice Act (JJ Act), wherever the dispute with respect to the age of a person arises in the context of her or him being a victim under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO Act), the following documents have to be relied upon:\n(i) the date of birth certificate from the school, or the matriculation or equivalent certificate from the concerned examination Board;\n(ii) in the absence of (i), the birth certificate given by a corporation or a municipal authority or a panchayat;\n(iii) in the absence of (i) and (ii) above, age shall be determined by an ossification test or any other latest medical age determination test.\nHence, the bench ruled that the Madras High Court was wrong in relying on a school transfer certificate and rejecting a doctor's opinion that the minor was 19 years old at the time of the incident.\nThe Court, therefore, set aside the conviction and sentence of a man (the instant appellant) booked for the sexual assault of a minor girl and for allegedly abetting their child marriage.\n\"The documents produced, i.e., a transfer certificate and extracts of the admission register, are not what Section 94 (2) (i) mandates; nor are they in accord with Section 94 (2) (ii) ... In these circumstances, the only piece of evidence, accorded with Section 94 of the JJ Act was the medical ossification test, based on several X-Rays of the victim ... Given all these circumstances, this court is of the opinion that the result of the ossification or bone test was the most authentic evidence, corroborated by the examining doctor,\" the Supreme Court said.\nThe top court, therefore, acquitted the accused of all the charges and ordered his release from jail.\nThe complaint in the case was filed in 2015, after the family of the minor accused the appellant and his aides of kidnapping the girl and forcibly marrying her off after repeated sexual assault.\nThe girl told the Magistrate that she had run away on her own free will with her lover and the sexual acts were consensual. However, she retracted her statement during the trial.\nThe trial court convicted the appellant under the POCSO Act, Prohibition of Child Marriage Act as well as Section 366 of the Indian Penal Code (for kidnapping, abducting or inducing a woman to compel her into mar­riage).\nThe Madras High Court, in December 2016, had upheld the conviction under the POCSO Act as well the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, but set aside the conviction of the present petitioner under Section 366 IPC.\nIt, therefore, had modified the sentence from rigorous life imprisonment to rigorous imprisonment for ten years. \nThe Supreme Court stated that none of the documents produced during the trial answered the description of “the date of birth certificate from the school” or “the matriculation or equivalent certificate” from the concerned examination board or certificate by a corporation, municipal authority or a Panchayat.\nIn the absence of documents as prescribed under the JJ Act, the prosecution had to prove through acceptable medical tests/examination that the victim’s age was below 18 years as per Section 94(2)(iii) of the JJ Act.\nThe age could not have been proved through a transfer certificate, the bench observed.\nFurther, the bench emphasised that the prosecution had failed to prove any forced sexual assault. \n\"The medical evidence (deposition of PW-11, Dr. Kavitha) indicated that the victim had a ruptured hymen; there was no external injury at her private parts, and no evidence to show that she had sexual assault ... It is only when there is penetrative sexual assault, which implies sexual contact with or without consent of the minor victim, that the offences under the POCSO Act are committed,\" the top court said. \nThe apex court took exception to the trial court discarding the statement of the girl before the Magistrate.\n\"The prosecution did not even cross examine this witness [Magistrate] ... the court is of the opinion that M’s statement under Section 164 of the CrPC contained a truthful narration of the events. This, in other words, meant that there was no penetrative sexual assault on her. Therefore, the provisions of the POCSO Act will not be applicable in this case\", the bench held while allowing the appeal.\nAdvocate ER Sumathy appeared for the appellant.

[State of Karnataka vs T Naseer and ors]\nA bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Rajesh Bindal added that a fair criminal trial does not mean the process is fair only to one side.\n\"A certificate under Section 65-B of the Act, which is sought to be produced by the prosecution is not an evidence which has been created now. It is meeting the requirement of law to prove a report on record. By permitting the prosecution to produce the certificate under Section 65B of the Act at this stage will not result in any irreversible prejudice to the accused. The accused will have full opportunity to rebut the evidence led by the prosecution,\" the Court explained.\nThe observations came while setting aside a 2018 Karnataka High Court order that had not allowed the prosecution in the 2008 Bengaluru blasts to produce the said certificate on the ground of delay. \nThe 2008 Bengaluru blasts had left one person dead and 20 others injured.\nIn 2018, the Karnataka High Court upheld the trial court's refusal to accept a Section 65B certificate submitted by the prosecution in relation to certain electronic evidence in the case. \nThe electronic evidence recovered during the probe had been sent the Central Forensic Sciences Laboratory (CFSL) in Hyderabad, which in turn prepared its report on the same in 2010.\nIn 2017, the trial court refused to accept the CFSL report since Section 65B certificate was not submitted along with it.\nAt the time, the prosecution argued that such a certificate was not necessary as the original electronic devices had been produced as primary evidence. \nHowever, the matter reached the High Court after the trial court refused to allow the production of the Section 65B certificate on grounds of delay.\nAfter the High Court affirmed the trial court order, the State government moved a plea before the Supreme Court for relief. \nThe top court relied on its earlier decision in Arjun Panditrao Khotkar vs Kailash Kushanrao Gorantyal to reiterate that such a certificate can be produced at any stage of the trial.\nThe bench found that the High Court's approach was erroneous and also noted that the defence had also objected to the lack of a certificate after a delay, only in 2017.\n\"It cannot be inferred that there was delay of six years in producing the certificate. In fact, report received from CFSL, Hyderabad on the basis of the contents of electronic devices dated 29.11.2010 was already placed before the Trial Court on 16.10.2012,\" the Supreme Court further observed.\nThe Karnataka government's appeal was, thus, allowed, and the prosecution was allowed to produce the Section 65B certificate. The trial court was directed to proceed with the trial accordingly. \n\"Fair trial in a criminal case does not mean that it should be fair to one of the parties. Rather, the object is that no guilty should go scot-free and no innocent should be punished\", the Supreme Court added.\nAdditional Advocate General Aman Panwar appeared for the Karnataka government.

{"ID": "id_126", "Summary": "The Supreme Court on Friday held that for most litigants in this country, only physically accessible institution for obtaining justice is the District Judiciary. Therefore, its independence assumes even greater significance [All India Judges Association v Union of India].\nA bench of Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud, Justices V Ramasubramanian and PS Narasimha underscored that without impartial and independent judges in the district judiciary, justice would remain illusory.\n\"The independence of the district judiciary must also be equally a part of the basic structure of the Constitution. Without impartial and independent judges in the district judiciary, Justice, a preambular goal would remain illusory. The district judiciary is, in most cases, also the Court which is most accessible to the litigant,\" the Court said.\nDrawing an important distinction between officers of the judiciary and staff of the legislative and executive wings, the Court said that judges are not employees of the State but holders of public office who wield sovereign judicial power.\n\"Separation of powers demands that the officers of the Judiciary be treated separately and distinct from the staff of the legislative and executive wings. It must be remembered the judges are not employees of the State but are holders of public office who wield sovereign judicial power. In that sense, they are only comparable to members of the legislature and ministers in the executive. Parity, thus, cannot be claimed between staff of the legislative wing and executive wing with officers of the judicial wing,\" the Court made it clear.\nThe Court made the observation while deciding a plea seeking the updation of judicial officers' service conditions.\n\"One may go to the extent to state that the rights of “access to justice” and “fair trial” cannot be exercised by an individual without an independent judiciary\", the court said. \nFurther, it stated that without fair and speedy trial, remaining rights including fundamental and constitutional rights will not be enforced in a manner known to law.\n\"If these instrumental rights themselves are hindered, then all other rights within the Constitution would not be enforceable.\"\nThe judgment added that the right of fair trial and access to justice is not limited to the physical access to a court but must also include all necessary prerequisites of a court such as, infrastructure, and an unbiased, impartial, and independent judge. \nIn the case at hand, the Court considered and accepted several recommendations made by the Second National Judicial Pay Commission constituted by the Central government. \nAs per the Commission's report, it analysed representations from various sources and periodically consulted with several experts while preparing working sheets and calculations.\nThe Court also took into account submissions by the Amicus Curiae advocate K Parameshwar who submitted that increase in pay of High Court judges must equally reflect an increase of pay for the district judiciary.\nHe also contended that uniformity must be maintained across the country in terms of pay and designation of the district judiciary.\nSenior Advocate Gourab Banerji, appearing for the petitioner All India Judges Association supported the report of the SNJPC and also supported the arguments made by the amicus curiae. \nSenior Advocate V Giri, representing All India Retired Judges Association supported the contentions made by the Amicus Curiae as well as Senior Advocate Gourab Banerji. Giri also reiterated the need for an urgent implementation of the Report of the SNJPC, especially in respect of pension to be paid to retired officers.\nThe counter arguments were led by Additional Solicitor General KM Nataraj who appeared for the State of Uttar Pradesh. \nThe Bench agreed with these submissions, stating that in the unified judicial system's hierarchy, a High Court judge is placed above a district judge. \nThus, once the salary of the district judge is pegged against the High Court judge, it follows that any increase in the salary of the judges of the High Court must reflect in the same proportion to the judges in the district judiciary.\nThe judgment also accepted the suggested change in nomenclature pan-India to include: Civil Judge (Jr. Div), Civil Judge (Sr. Div), and District Judge.\n\"High Courts are directed to ensure that the designation of judicial officers is uniformly the same as mentioned in the above paragraph.\"\nThe recommendation to bring the district judiciary's pay structure in conformity with the Seventh Central Pay Commission was also accepted and directed to be implemented.\nWith this, High Courts and competent authorities were asked to make necessary amendments to Service Rules in conformity with the recommendations accepted by the Court within three months. \nAdditionally, revised rates of pension approved by the Court will be payable from July 1, 2023."}
{"ID": "id_1261", "Summary": "The Calcutta High Court on Tuesday ordered the Union Finance Ministry to set up a committee to inquire into the apparently shocking, fraudulent, and collusive conduct of the Indian Railways and its officials in an arbitration proceeding [Union of India v. Rashmi Metaliks Ltd.].\nJustice Shekhar B Saraf also ordered an unconditional stay on the arbitral award passed in a dispute between the South Eastern Railways (SER) and a public limited company, Rashmi Metaliks Limited.\nThe judge passed the order after noting that, prima facie, there were glaring irregularities and palpable impropriety in the conduct of the Railways before the tribunal.\n“It shocks the conscience of this Court to observe that the Railways, in defending a claim valued above ₹4000 crores, declined to present any witness and refrained from leading any evidence,\" the Court remarked.\nThe Court added that the lackadaisical and indifferent attitude of the Railways during the arbitral proceedings leaves much to be said about the \"sordid state of affairs\" and the \"absolute apathetic approach of the Railways\", even though it was a Government of India public sector undertaking that deals with funds from the public exchequer.\nThere appeared to be a disconcerting trend where the hallowed principles of honesty, integrity, and probity seem to have gone up in smoke, Justice Saraf further noted. \nThe judge, therefore, ordered a probe into this case by a special committee, which is to submit its report to the Court within three months.\n“I hereby also direct the Ministry of Finance, Union of India to immediately constitute a multi-member high-level enquiry committee headed by a Secretary to the Government of India level rank officer to holistically inquire into the shocking conduct of the Railways and its officials (both serving and retired) and the other stakeholders in the aforementioned matter. The Committee shall be at liberty to take assistance of central investigation agencies as it may deem fit. The Committee is further requested to complete the enquiry and submit a report before this Court within three months from the date of this order,” the order stated.\nThe case further prompted Justice Saraf to express that he was deeply worried by the attitude of the Railways. Public sector companies are usually expected to act with more diligence since they are the embodiment of taxpayers’ trust, the Court noted.\nHowever, the way the Railways has belittled its responsibility made the Court doubt the utility of arbitration proceedings when it comes to public sector companies.\n“Not to mince my words, the attitude of some of the parties, especially public sector companies towards the arbitration process and utter disregard for it has made me doubt the future of arbitration in India if it keeps going the present way,” the Court said.\nThe Court added that it would not have spoken out if it were not an absolute necessity.\n“Such actions disturb the very fabric of citizen’s trust in public entities, and it is a duty that this Court owes to the citizens to act where needed,” the Court said.\nThe Court further observed that the Railways is not just an entity that carries citizens across destinations, but that it is an embodiment of the “hopes and dreams of a billion people.”\n“Its conduct is more than just a ripple in the ocean. It should realize the need to conduct itself according to the highest standards and not resort to dubious ways in any way or form that does not suit its character,” the Court opined.\nBackground\nThe Court was dealing with a batch of pleas connected to a May 2021 arbitral award and corrections made to this award in August 2021, whereby the tribunal ultimately ordered the South Eastern Raliways to pay Rashmi Metaliks a sum of approximately ₹1,301 crores.\nNotably, the Indian Railways challenged the award by way of an application under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, apart from seeking a stay of the award under Section 36 of the Act. On the other hand, Rashmi Metaliks sought execution of the award. \nThe Court, however, found that there were indications that the Railways itself had acted collusively in the matter. The arbitral tribunal’s corrected order also left the Court baffled.\nThe judge proceeded to note that there were two aspects indicating collusion, foul play, fraud, and corruption in the passing of the arbitral award.\nThe first was the manner in which the Railways conducted itself, which the Court opined “screams of surreptitious connivance between the parties” as if it was already decided that the Railways should abandon its case and “superficially continue to fight an already lost battle.”\nThe second aspect pinpointed was the “atrocious explanation given by the arbitral tribunal in justifying its order of corrections”, which the judge said had left him at a loss for words.\nThe Court found that the corrected order had enhanced the arbitral award by about four times “under the garb of a typographical error.” Unconvinced by this explanation, the Court reasoned that the actual truth behind the corrections must be unearthed.\n“The aforesaid order made me wonder if the tribunal thinks so lowly of the executing courts where it may have hoped that such corrections would be permitted a safe passage without any scrutiny whatsoever,” he further remarked.\nThe “willing silence” of the Indian Railways over such an arbitral order was also “too loud to go neglected and prima facie leads to the conclusion that there is unseen foul play”, the Court added.\nThe Court, therefore, stayed the arbitral order after noting that the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 allows for such intervention if the award appears to be induced or effected by fraud or corruption. \nThe Court ordered that the unconditional stay would remain until the Section 34 petition is decided.\nAdvocates Siddhartha Lahiri, Deepak K Singh, and Souvik Nandy appeared for the Union of India (Indian Railways).\nAdvocate General SN Mookherjee, and advocates Samrat Sen, Suman Dutt, Paritosh Sinha, Amitava Mitra, Manali Bose, Antara Choudhury, Subhrojyoti Mookherjee, and Naman Chowdhury appeared for Rashmi Metaliks Limited."}

Secretary to the Government, Adi Dravidar and Tribal Welfare Department and ors).\nA Bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice M Duraiswamy was dealing a petition seeking cancellation of a certificate signifying that the petitioner belonged to the Hindu Pallan community.\nThere was no dispute that the petitioner-woman had been born to Hindu Pallan parents, the Court noted. However, the marriage of the petitioner to a christian and the fact that their children were recognised as belonging to the husband's community, is stated to have led to the cancellation of the petitioner's community certificate, the Court was told. \nThe authorities countered that they had visited the petitioner's medical clinic, where they found a cross hanging on the wall. The Court, however, was unconvinced that this can be a reason to conclude that the petitioner had also embraced Christianity. \nThe Bench added that even if the petitioner went to church with her christian husband and children, it would not necessarily indicate that she has altogether abandoned her original faith. \n\"Such officials apparently found a cross hanging on the wall and on the basis of such cross, the officials conjectured that the petitioner had converted to Christianity and was, thus, disqualified from retaining the Hindu Pallan community certificate. There is no suggestion in the affidavit that the petitioner has abandoned her faith or that the petitioner has embraced Christianity. It is equally possible that the petitioner, as a part of a family, may accompany the petitioner's husband and children for Sunday matins but the mere fact that a person goes to church does not mean that such person has altogether abandoned the original faith to which such person was born,\" the Court reasoned. \nThe Court commented further that the acts of the authorities portrayed a degree of narrow-mindedness that the Constitution does not encourage. \n\"Nothing may be presumed upon a member of a particular community respecting another community or another religion and, indeed, that is the constitutional mandate and not otherwise,\" the Court said. \nThe Court went on to quash the cancellation of the petitioner's community certificate, terming it arbitrary and based on surmises and conjectures without any material fact in support. The community certificate of the petitioner was directed to be restored with immediate effect. \n\"It would do well for the members of the scrutiny committee to approach the matter with a broader mind than is evident in the present case,\" the Court added. \nAdvocate C Mayil Vahana Rajendran appeared for the petitioner whereas Additional Government Pleader P Thilak Kumar appeared for the State authorities. \nHanging cross on wall, going to church not ground to cancel Scheduled Caste certificate: Madras High Court#madrashighcourt #castecertificateRead more here: https://t.co/Pw7dtZF5WM pic.twitter.com/la88CuJdUg"}

As a result, all interim orders of this Court stand vacated,\" the Court ruled.\nA Division Bench of the Delhi High Court had stayed an order passed by the single-judge, who had pursuant to the emergency arbitrator's award, directed attachment of properties of Future Group companies and Kishore Biyani in relation to the Future-Reliance deal \nThe Single Judge order of the High Court had upheld the award of an emergency arbitrator, directed attachment of the properties and restrained Future Retail Limited from going ahead with the ₹24,713 crore merger with Reliance Retail.\nThis order was subsequently stayed by a Division Bench, prompting the appeal by Amazon.\nDuring the course of the proceedings before the apex court, the Bench clarified that only two issues would be decided in this appeal:\n1) Whether Section 17(1) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 covers an Emergency Arbitrator's awards; and\n2) Whether an order passed under Section 17(2) of the Arbitration Act in enforcement of the award of an Emergency Arbitrator by a Single Judge of the High Court is appealable.\nThe Court said that the definition of “arbitration” in Section 2(1)(a) means any arbitration, whether or not administered by a permanent arbitral institution, when read with Sections 2(6) and 2(8), would make it clear that even interim orders that are passed by Emergency Arbitrators under the rules of a permanent arbitral institution, would be included within the ambit of Section 17(2).\n\"When Section 17(1) uses the expression “during the arbitral proceedings”, the said expression would be elastic enough, when read with the provisions of Section 21 of the Act, to include emergency arbitration proceedings. It is significant to note that the words “arbitral proceedings” are not limited by any definition and thus encompass proceedings before an Emergency Arbitrator,\" the judgment said.\nThere is nothing in Section 17(1), when read with the other provisions of the Act, to interdict the application of rules of arbitral institutions that the parties may have agreed to, the Court reaffirmed. \n\"This being the position, at least insofar as Section 17(1) is concerned, the “arbitral tribunal” would, when institutional rules apply, include an Emergency Arbitrator, the context of Section 17 “otherwise requiring” – the context being interim measures that are ordered by arbitrators,\" the Court said.\nSection 17(2) lays down that subject to any orders passed in an appeal under section 37, any order issued by the arbitral tribunal under this section shall be deemed to be an order of the court for all purposes and shall be enforceable under the Code of Civil Procedure\nThe Court held that there is no doubt that Section 17(2) creates a legal fiction and that this fiction is created only for the purpose of enforceability of interim orders made by the arbitral tribunal.\"\n\"To extend it to appeals being filed under the Code of Civil Procedure would be a big leap not envisaged by the legislature at all in enacting the said fiction,\" the Court said. \nThus, no appeal would lie under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act against an order of enforcement of an Emergency Arbitrator’s order made under Section 17(2) of the Act.\nSenior Advocate Aspi Chinoy on behalf of Amazon submitted that the promoters of FRL - Kishore Biyani and Rakesh Biyani - were the real focus of the matter, since they negotiated and induced Amazon into entering into multiple agreements and subsequently, wilfully breached them.\n\"In the clash of corporates, one must not lose sight of the dramatis personae as that is where the driving force comes from,” he said.\nChinoy urged the Bench to resolve the epiphany of the the Biyans that struck them at a later stage that an award by the emergency arbitrator is contrary to the Arbitration Act.\nSenior Advocate Gopal Subramanium for Amazon argued that the parties consented to arbitration governed by the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) Rules, subject to Indian law.\nTherefore, they agreed to emergency arbitration when they agreed to be governed by the SIAC Rules till the constitution of an arbitral tribunal.\nSenior Advocate Harish Salve, appearing for FRL, made submissions regarding the error in the order passed by Single Judge, Justice JR Midha.\nSalve submitted that there is no concept of an emergency arbitrator under Indian law, and that it is a matter of right that once an award comes for execution to an Indian court, its jurisdiction can be argued.\nFurther, it would amount to amendment by construction, should the emergency arbitrator's awards be given the same legal efficacy as orders under Section 17 of the Act, submitted Salve.\n“The exercise of amendment to include EAs as tribunals under the 1996 Act, must be by the Parliament and not by the courts.”\nSalve had also reiterated that there was no arbitration agreement between Amazon and FRL to begin with.\nHe elucidated that the prerequisite for an arbitration proceeding is the constitution of an arbitral tribunal, one that is competent to pass an award.\nIncluding an emergency arbitrator (EA) into the scheme of the Act would create a fork in the road, where parties will have recourse to either go to an EA or seek redressal under Section 9, he had added.\nThe Bench had reserved its judgment on July 29, 2021.\nSenior Advocate Gopal Subramanium appeared for Amazon and was briefed by P&A Law Offices and AZB & Partners.\nSenior Advocate Harish Salve, appeared for FRL was briefed by Naik Naik & Co. \nAgarwala Law Associates briefed Vikram Nankani who represented Future Coupon Private Limited and the promoters."}

{"ID": "id_1270", "Summary": "The Chhattisgarh High Court recently held that a wife frequently visiting her husband's office and abusing and insulting him and creating a scene in front of the husband's colleagues would amount to cruelty entitling the husband to divorce [Nalini Mishra v Surendra Patel].\nA division bench of Justice Goutam Bhaduri and Justice Radhakishan Agrawal was hearing an appeal filed by woman challenging the family court's order granting divorce on the ground of cruelty by wife.\n\"It is established that the wife used to visit the office of the husband and create scene with abusive language. In such a situation when a wife goes to the office premises of the husband, abuses him and accuses him of certain relation, naturally it would result into diminishing the image of the husband before the colleagues and the office stature will certainly go down,\" the Court said.\nThe bench also observed that a complaint filed by wife with the Chief Minister alleging that her husband was having an illicit affair with a female colleague and should, therefore, be transferred, amounted to cruelty. \n\"Complaint by wife against husband to Minister claiming a transfer of husband on the ground of illicit relation with a lady colleague without any substance would amount to cruelty,\" the judgment said. \nThe Court, therefore, upheld a family court order which had granted divorce to the husband.\nBy way of background, the couple had gotten married in the year 2010 and a child was born out of the wedlock. It was alleged by the respondent/husband that the wife used to spent money as per her own choice and objected to the husband visiting his parents.\nThe husband further alleged that the wife used to take away his entire salary and used to spent the same in her business. If any query was made about the expenses, it was reciprocated with the abuses. It was also alleged that the wife procured 5 vehicles on loan without the consent of the husband and she deliberately stopped to discharge her household responsibilities including taking care of the child.\nShe also started making allegations of the husband having illicit relations with other women.\nSubsequently, husband filed for divorce on ground of cruelty. The family Court after evaluating the facts and evidence, allowed the plea and a decree of divorce was granted. Interestingly, one of the sisters of wife deposed before the Court against the wife and in favour of the husband.\nAggrieved by that order, the present appeal was filed by the wife.\nThe counsel for wife submitted that the family court failed to appreciate the fact that the wife was treated with cruelty by her husband.\nIt was contended that the statement of the wife would show that cruelty was meted out by the husband to her and he tried to create false evidence to get divorce.\nIt was further submitted that the wife wanted to live with the husband along with child but on the some reason or the other, the husband did not want to stay with the wife. He further submitted that the wife was financially independent and the allegation of the husband that the wife was interested in the money of the husband was complete falsehood. \nIt was also contended that family court rendered the erroneous judgment only based on the deposition of one of her real sisters. The statement of the wife and the cross-examination of the husband do not bring home factor of cruelty and only for the reason that one real sister has deposed against the wife, the family Court fell into error to hold the factum of cruelty, it was submitted.\nOn the other hand, the counsel for husband argued that the wife not only indulged in character assassination of her husband by alleging extra-marital affair but also went to the extent of going to his office and creating a scene there in front of his colleagues. \nShe also sent letters to the Chief Minister seeking transfer of her husband alleging that he had illicit relations. \nThe bench noted that the assessment of the evidence showed that the wife used to abuse the husband on trivial issues. \nThe Court also highlighted some instances of wife's conduct. One was report/ letter sent by the wife to the Chief Minister seeking transfer of her husband.\n\"The wife when was confronted with such letter, denied to have signed it. In the deposition memo and the affidavit, the signature of the wife is appended. When the signature of Ex. P-4 is compared with the signature of the affidavit and the deposition sheet, it prima facie shows that it is one and same. Therefore, in exercise of power under Section 73 of the Evidence Act by comparison of the signature, we hold it that there is no ambiguity or any slightest deflection that Ex. P-4 was signed by the wife Nalini,\" the Court said.\nRegarding the allegations of illicit relations made by the wife, the Court said that there was no evidence apart from the oral statement of the wife to substantiate such allegations. \nImportantly, the Court noted that the sister of the wife itself had deposed against her.\n\"In her statement she deposed that Nalini, her sister, is an angry and quarrelsome lady. She started living separately with her earlier husband after living with him for two years at Odisha, whereby the first husband Paresh Vishwakarma landed in many troubles and suffered illness and eventually died. Thereafter, her sister came down to Raipur along with his son and was staying with them. Thereafter, she left the children in the custody of the sister and her mother and started living with one Umesh at place Changorabhatha. The family members thereafter intervened and she again came back and started work of contractor,\" the Court noted.\nAs per that deposition, the wife subsequently got a job of drain construction work contract at Bilaigarh and Kasdol, she came in contact with Surendra. Subsequently, she was married in the year 2010.\n\"She further deposed that she used to abuse on trivial issues even to the cousin sister of Surendra Patel and the lady staff in the office and used to doubt the character of them. She further stated that the sister Nalini at many times used to go to the office of her husband and made all noise & create a scene and used to complain. She accompanied with her at some times, subsequently she stopped joining with her. She further stated that when the cousin sister came to appear in an examination, she was thrown out on the ground that the husband has illicit relation with her,\" the Court observed.\nThus, it held that the over all assessment of the evidence showed that the appellant/wife used to abuse the husband on trivial issues and even other instances of wife's conduct amounted to cruelty.\n\"Even it is stated that the wife used to abuse the in-laws and stopped the husband to meet his parents, which would also amount to cruelty. To pull back the husband to attend the marriage procession in the mid way, whereby the husband was forced to leave the marriage of his younger brother is also an unnatural cruel act. Such act would bring down the image and the prestige of a family in the public hike, which may also amount to cruelty,\" the judgment said.\nThe bench, therefore, upheld verdict of the Family Court and dismissed the appeal.\nThe appellant was represented by Advocate Shishir Shrivastava while the respondent was represented by Advocate C. Jayant K. Rao."}

Finding that the case fell under the category of rarest of rare, the death penalty was awarded.\nThe appellant submitted that the trial court committed a grave error in convicting him since there was no admissible evidence in the case.

In case of prima facie non-compliance with mandatory provision of Section 50, the accused is entitled to be released on bail within the meaning of Section 37 of NDPS Act, he further submitted\nGovernment Advocate, Akhilesh Kumar Awasthi on the other hand opposed the prayer for bail, contending that the innocence of the applicant cannot be adjudged at pre-trial stage.\nFurther, he submitted that if the applicant is released on bail, he will again indulge in similar activity and the “reasonable grounds” mentioned in Section 37(1) (b)(ii) of NDPS Act mean something more than prima facie ground.\nThe Court placed reliance on the apex court's judgment in the case of Union of India vs. Shiv Shankar Keshari and larger mandate of Article 21 of the constitution of India, to grant bail to the accused.\n\"The severity of punishment which conviction will entail, the character of the accused-applicant, circumstances which are peculiar to the accused, reasonable possibility of securing the presence of the accused at the trial, reasonable apprehension of the witnesses being tampered with, the larger interest of the public/State and other circumstances, but without expressing any opinion on the merits, I am of the view that it is a fit case for grant of bail,\" the Court said.\nThe same Bench had, on October 22, granted bail to another man accused of possessing 21 kg charas."}

Aggrieved by this amendment, the petitioner couples approached the High Court.\nA Bench of Justices GS Kulkarni and Firdosh Pooniwalla observed that the wives failed to conceive due to various medical complications.\n“The petitioners contend that they were left with no option but to achieve parenthood by surrogacy. Considering such facts, the petitioners need to adopt the surrogacy procedure and in doing so, they cannot be foisted with the rules under challenge.

If we look at the legislative intent of the Arbitration Act,1996 and what our country is hoping to be as the destination of choice for Arbitration, I’m of the considered opinion that it would be appropriate to interpret the statutory interplay in a constructive manner without defeating the legislative intent and thwarting the speedy referral to arbitration,\" he concluded.\nJustice Roy opined that the Court in Garware Wall Ropes Ltd v.

State of Rajasthan, Through Public Prosecutor]. \nA division bench of Justice Arun Bhansali and Justice Pankaj Bhandari passed the decision while ruling on a criminal reference on whether the complainant or the first informant is a necessary party in bail applications under Sections 437, 438 and 439 (provisions for bail including pre-arrest bail) of Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). \nThe High Court had issued a Standing Order on September 15 for directions to implead the victim as a party-respondent. The administrative direction was passed on the basis of observations made by a Single Judge in Nitoo Singh @ Nitu Singh Versus State of Rajasthan on August 8. \nDisagreeing with the decision, another single-judge had referred the matter for decision by a larger bench. \nBefore the division bench, the lawyers representing the accused as well as the State said impleadment of the victim was not a requirement.\nConsidering the contentions, the Court said a bare perusal of the provisions of bail under CrPC revealed that there is no requirement for impleading the victim as a party-respondent in bail applications. \nHowever, the Court also noted that the statute provides for giving opportunity of hearing to victim in cases relating to some of Sections pertaining to offence of rape.\n“However, Section 439(1A) of Cr.P.C. was inserted by Act 22 of 2018 with effect from April 21, 2018, which makes presence of the informant or any person authorised by him obligatory at the time of hearing of the application for bail to the person under sub- section (3) of Section 376AB or Section 376DA or Section 376DB of the Indian Penal Code,” it added.\nThe Court concluded that the effect of the Standing Order is that the accused persons shall be bound to remain in custody awaiting service of notices upon the victims, which is in direct conflict with their right to personal liberty guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India.\nIt also noted that the definition of victim under the CrPC is sufficiently wide enough to include every person of the family of the victim. \n“It would be humongous task for the accused to serve notices upon all the victims and much greater task would be the determination of victims in a criminal case. Equally, troublesome would be the service on the victim without having their proper addresses,” the bench said.\nOn the Supreme Court’s ruling in Jagjeet Singh & Ors. Versus Ashish Mishra & Monu & Anr where the top court said the victim has unbridled participatory rights in criminal proceedings, the High Court said it does not mean that the victim must replace or substitute the State as the prosecuting agency.\nIt added that top court's ruling also means that the victim must be impleaded as a party to the proceedings so as to make the victim answerable in all aspects.\nThe Court further opined that had there been an intention of the legislature, it would have been mentioned in unequivocal terms that impleadment of the victim was a necessary party in all the cases.\nIt also observed the provision where Magistrate has been authorised to release persons under the age of 16 years or woman or sick or infirm, would become redundant and the court would have to wait for impleadment of victim as a party and then hear them.\n“In many non-bailable offences, accused, who is in custody is not knowing the name of the victim and in such cases, his bail application would be delayed, which would be violative of Article 21 of the Constitution of India as his custody would be dehors the provisions of the statute,” the Court added.\nThe Court also took into account the provisions under which the State is under an obligation to prosecute the offenders and for this purpose, various public prosecutors are appointed.  \nIt is important to note that the above provisions recognize the State’s responsibility to uphold public order and ensure access to justice for all, especially in situations where the victim’s voice might otherwise go unheard, the Court remarked.\nTaking note that none of the members have supported the view taken by the single-judge whose observations led to issuance of the Standing Order, the bench said,\n“We are of the clear view that neither the statute directs impleadment of victim as a party-respondent nor the judgment of Jagjeet Singh & Ors. Versus Ashish Mishra & Monu & Anr. (supra) directs impleadment of victim as a necessary party.

{"ID": "id_1305", "Summary": "If a woman agrees to waive her right to claim maintenance from her husband, and opts for a divorce by mutual consent, she cannot later demand maintenance under the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), the Madras High Court has held.  \nIn a judgment passed on September 16, Justice Bharatha Chakravarthy rejected a revision petition filed by a woman challenging the decision of a family court that had refused to direct her ex-husband to pay her a monthly maintenance of ₹1 lakh, and to pay a lump sum amount of ₹5.80 crore for the medical treatment of their 35-year-old son.\nJustice Chakravarthy, however, upheld the family court's direction asking the husband to pay an enhanced monthly maintenance of ₹80,000 to the son, who suffers from 'Refractory Seizure Disorder,' and has other related health issues. \nThe Court was hearing two revision petitions, one filed by the woman seeking that the family court order denying her maintenance be set aside, and another filed by the husband, seeking that the family court order asking him to pay monthly maintenance of ₹80,000 instead of the current ₹20,000 to his son, be stayed. \nThe couple got divorced in 2005 by mutual consent under Section 13B of the Hindu Marriage Act. At the time, the husband had custody of their son and he undertook to take full care of him. The wife gave up her claim to maintenance at the time, saying that she did not need anything else except that her son be taken care of.\nHowever, in 2011, the wife took custody of the son, claiming that the husband did not keep his word on looking after their son, and had instead got him admitted to a medical care centre.\nBefore the High Court, the wife claimed that she had forgone her rights to maintenance trusting that the father will continue to maintain the son properly. But, to her shock, the father had \"dumped\" the son in the said institution, she said.\nOn the contrary, the husband argued that once the wife had given up her claim to maintenance, she could not ask for it now. \nThe Court said that while a divorced wife had a right to maintenance, Section 125(4) of the CrPC made it clear that if a woman was living separately from her husband based on mutual consent, she was not entitled to any maintenance. Referring to the judgment in the mutual consent petition, the Court highlighted,\n\"Secondly, even in the judgment of mutual consent petition, the default situation is also taken care of.

The Delhi High Court may well answer this mouth-watering question in the coming days as it adjudicates a dispute between the Moti Mahal and Daryaganj restaurants [Rupa Gujral & Ors v Daryaganj Hospitality Private Limited & Ors]\nThe proprietors of Moti Mahal have sued owners of Daryaganj restaurant over the use of the tagline “Inventors of Butter Chicken and Dal Makhani” . \nMoti Mahal claims that Daryaganj restaurant is “misleading people into believing” that there is a relation between Daryaganj restaurants and Moti Mahal whose first branch was opened in Daryaganj neighbourhood of Delhi.\nThe case came up for hearing before Justice Sanjeev Narula on January 16 when the Court issued summons and asked Daryaganj restaurant owners to file their written response to the suit in a month.\nJustice Narula also issued notice on Moti Mahal’s application for interim injunction and kept it for hearing on May 29.\nFor years, the two restaurant chains have claimed that they invented Butter Chicken and Dal Makhani. \nWhile Moti Mahal owners say that it was their predecessor, Late Kundal Lal Gujral who came up with the dishes that now define Indian cuisine across the globe, Daryaganj restaurant says it was Late Kundan Lal Jaggi who came up with the idea.\nIn its suit, Moti Mahal has claimed that it was their predecessor Gujral who created the first Tandoori Chicken and later also went on to create the Butter Chicken and Dal Makhani and brought it to India after partition. \nThey claim that in the early days, the unsold leftovers of chicken could not be stored in the refrigeration and Gujral began worrying about his cooked chicken drying out. He thus invented a sauce with which he could rehydrate them.\nHis invention was ‘the makhani’ or butter sauce (a gravy with tomatoes, butter, cream, and some spices) that now gives the dish a tangy and delectable taste, the claim goes. \n“The invention of Dal Makhani is closely linked with the invention of Butter Chicken. He [Gujaral] applied the same recipe with Black lentils and gave birth to Dal Makhani around the same time,” Moti Mahal has said in suit.\nWhile Daryaganj is yet to file its response to the suit, its lawyers appeared before the Court on January 16 and strongly contested the allegations labelling the whole suit as “baseless and lacking a cause of action”.\nIt was their argument that they have not engaged in any false representation and the allegations made in the suit are far from truth.\nThey said that the first Moti Mahal restaurant was jointly established by predecessors of both parties (Gujral of Moti Mahal and Jaggi of Daryaganj restaurants) in Peshawar.\nSenior Advocate Sandeep Sethi and Chander M Lall along with advocate Shreya Sethi appeared for the proprietors of Moti Mahal.\nSenior Advocate Amit Sibal along with advocates Pravin Anand, Dhruv Anand, Udita, Revanta Mathur, Nimrat Singh and D Khanna represented the owners of Daryaganj restaurant."}

The petitioner is expected to disclose true and correct facts before making any allegation against respondents. The petitioner in person, being a practising lawyer, is also expected to verify the same, himself and then levelled such allegations against the respondents. It is also expected that source of such information as well as material, if any, must be brought on record and in absence of the same, the allegations made in the writ petition cannot be accepted,\" the Court said.\nIt also noted that neither the accused IPS officer nor his family members authorised the petitioner to file the petition.\n\"There is nothing on record to show that the accused employee Mani Lal Patidar or any of his family members has authorised the petitioner herein to file the present writ petition for the relief sought. Thus, the petitioner herein has unauthorisedly filed the present writ petition,\" the Court said.\nTherefore, besides imposing costs on the petitioner, the Court also directed the Bar Council of Delhi to take appropriate action against Verma for filing frivolous petitions. \nThe petitioner had moved the Court alleging that his client was receiving life threats from \"agents of State\" and should be provided police protection. \nA slew of other prayers were also made against State authorities.\nThe Court noted that Verma himself had earlier filed a Habeas Corpus petition seeking production of Patidar and the same was pending before the Court. \nIn that petition, Verma had submitted that Patidar had been conducting operations against mining mafia and relations with certain section in the administration got sour as a result and he was falsely implicated in a few cases.\nThe Court also noted that Patidar himself had filed lot of criminal writ petitions before the High Court and the orders passed in those petitions revealed that there was no statement made by any of lawyers that Patidar was missing. \nOrders in one of those petitions recorded that Patidar was absconding and not cooperating with the investigation.\n\"From the facts briefly noticed above, it appears that the accused Mani Lal Patidar is absconding and against him proceedings under Section 82, Cr.P.C. has also been initiated and whose criminal miscellaneous writ petitions have been dismissed and anticipatory bail applications have been rejected.

{"ID": "id_131", "Summary": "The protective shield under Section 17A of the Prevention of Corruption Act (PC Act) is only for honest public servants and not for corrupt ones, the Patna High Court observed while denying anticipatory bail to the Vice Chancellor (VC) of Magadh University, Dr. Rajendra Prasad in a cheating case [Dr Rajendra Prasad vs State of Bihar]. \nThe Court was hearing two pleas filed by Dr. Prasad, who also holds additional charge of Veer Kunwar Singh University, seeking anticipatory bail and also seeking quashing of the first information report (FIR) lodged against him last year.\nThe contention of the accused was that the prosecution had not obtained the mandatory sanction to prosecute him under Section 17A of the PC Act.\nSingle-judge Justice Ashutosh Kumar referred to various judgments of the Supreme Court on interpretation of this provision along with Section 197(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), to hold that not every offence committed by a public servant would require such a sanction.\n\"Nor every act done by him while he is actually engaged in the performance of his official duties, so that, if questioned, it could be claimed to have been done by virtue of the office, would require such sanction. It is only when the act complained of is directly connected with the official duties that sanction is necessary. If the act complained has no nexus or reasonable connection or relevance to the official act or duty and the act is otherwise illegal, unlawful or in the nature of an offence, the shelter of 197 CrPC is not available, which protection is qualified and conditional,\" Justice Kumar held.\nThe purpose of the provision is to protect public servants from baseless prosecution, the Court underlined. \n\"The protective shield is for an honest public servant and not for a corrupt one...There is a clear division between those acts which constitute an offence and those acts, though done while discharging the official duties of the public servant, but which do not constitute an act done in exercise of official duties or functions,\" the judge added.\nThe FIR against the applicant disclosed that while working as Vice-Chancellor, Magadh University, he had entered into a criminal conspiracy with his PA-cum-Assistant Subodh Kumar and two private firms viz. M/s. XLICT Software Private Ltd., based in Lucknow and M/s. Poorva Graphics and Offset Printers as also the Finance Officer of Veer Kunwar Singh University as well as the Registrar of Patliputra University and had thereby dishonestly cheated the government ex-chequer to the extent of approximately ₹20 crores during the check-period 2019-21 while making purchases of various items like e-books and OMR answer-sheets for use in University for conducting examination. \nAs per the prosecution case, such purchases worth several crores were made by adopting a procedure, which was arbitrary and with the sole purpose of getting undue advantage to himself. There was no requisition or tender and the materials, in derogation of the financial rules, were not procured through procedure.\nIt was claimed that the E-Books which were purchased for Veer Kunwar Singh University were not even put to any use for the reason that there was no sufficient infrastructure for storage of those E-Books and that such purchases were against the advice of the Head of the Departments of various subjects, whose sanction and recommendation were necessary for procurement of the books. \nUpon search, it was found that the accused had acquired huge movable and immovable property at different places from such proceeds of crime.\nAccordingly, an FIR was registered against the accused under Sections 120B and 420B of the IPC read with Sections 12 read with Sections 13(ii) read with Sections 13(i)(b) of the PC Act.\nIn his 50-page judgment, Justice Kumar said that protection under Section 17A cannot be used as a sword to stifle prosecution for per-se criminal offences which can never be in discharge of official duty or in connection with recommendation made by a higher officer.\n\"The protective cover is in the nature of a permitted exception to the equality provision of the Constitution. Any unnecessary and broad interpretation of the section would defeat the very purpose of such protective discrimination in favour of honest and dutiful officers,\" the judge observed.\nThe accused relied upon the judgment of the apex court in the review petitions in Rafale case, wherein Justice KM Joseph in his judgment had held that since Section 17A isn't challenged, the petitioners should have had filed a complaint in accordance with law but subject to the authorities obtaining previous sanction under Section 17A of the PC Act.\nJustice Kumar, however, clarified that this couldn't be read as an omnibus protective cover.\n\"Such an observation in Yashwant Sinha, cannot be read as an omnibus protective cover to any public servant accused of committing a criminal act under the garb of performing official duty. Moreover, the Apex Court, in that instance, had not opined that the protection under Section 17A of the Act was an omnibus protection, without following the test of the alleged offence being in the nature of recommendation or the decision taken being in discharge of official duty. Thus, the observation is only a passing reference in the nature of a sidewind, which does not sweep away the established parameters under the Act, which has been explained by the Apex Court for claiming protection under Section 17A of the Act,\" the Court said.\nThe bench further opined that the accused wasn't performing his official duties by committing the acts as alleged in the FIR and thus prior sanction was not needed in the instant case.\n\"He was made known that such procedure in financial matters cannot be ignored but despite that, he went for such purchases from unknown firms and the payment was made in the account of a person who is untraceable till today. This, even at the risk of repetition, cannot be part of official duty or relatable to any recommendation made with respect to any policy decision,\" the Court held.\nIt further opined that the courts in such cases of financial irregularities, need to bear in mind the consequences that would befall on the society.\n\"Regard being had to the overt act of the petitioner in causing huge financial losses to the state exchequer, the possibility of the petitioner tampering with the witnesses and the evidence and the magnitude of dishonesty by a person holding an office as high as that of a Vice Chancellor of the University which is considered to be a temple of learning, this Court is not persuaded to admit the petitioner to anticipatory bail,\" the Court ordered. \nSenior Advocate Jitendra Singh and advocates Ranjeet Kumar and Jai Prakash Singh appeared for the accused.\nAdvocate Rana Vikram Singh appeared for State's special vigilance unit and advocate Mohammad Sufyan represented the State.\nNote: The accused has resigned from the post."}

The power of the ICC to hold the enquiry and give a report ought to be within the scheme and the four corners of the statute itself. If a case of sexual harassment is not made out, the ICC can only conclude that no action is required to be taken.. It is not contemplated within the provisions of the Act that while holding that no action is to be taken and the complaint is to be rejected, the ICC can direct for suitable action on the ground that the parties have indulged in an inappropriate conduct,\" the Court explained. \nIt added that the ICC had no power to make comments on the personal conduct of the parties as its jurisdiction was restricted to the allegations of sexual harassment and whether a complaint was made out or not. \nAccordingly, the ICC order, to the extent that it made comments on the conduct of the parties and recommended initiation of action against the parties, was set aside by the High Court. \nSince the petitioner had also become eligible for promotion, the Court ordered that the chargesheet would not be an obstacle. \nAdvocates Vrinda Grover and Ankur Sood appeared for the petitioner. \nThe employer was represented by Advocates Rajesh Kr.

However, only because laws can be misused, the legislature cannot stop enacting laws nor judiciary can stop applying such laws since they have been enacted to curb the larger menace of commission of such offences and getting justice to genuine victims,” the Court underlined.\nJustice Sharma was dealing with a plea filed by a man accused of sexual assault of a seven-year-old girl in 2016 and charged with several offences under the POCSO Act as well as Sections 376 (rape) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).\nThe accused Rakesh had approached the High Court challenging the trial court order rejecting his application under Section 311 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). The petitioner had sought directions to re-call the survivor and her mother on the ground that their cross-examination conducted earlier was just for the sake of formality.\nAfter considering the case, the Court said that six years have passed since the testimonies of the prosecutrix and her mother were recorded before the trial court.\nThe Court further noted that child-victim has relived the trauma of perverse sexual assault upon her at a very tender age of seven years, once, when she was sexually assaulted, thereafter while recording her statement before the police and under Section 164 CrPC before the Magistrate and then before the trial court while recording her evidence.\n“The victim, being only of seven years of age having gone through this repeated trauma on number of occasions and period mentioned above, cannot be directed to appear once again after six years to depose about the same incident, only on the ground that the previous counsel had cross-examined the witness in a manner which the new counsel does not find sufficient or appropriate,” Justice Sharma held.\nThe Court, therefore, rejected the plea.\nAdvocate Hitesh Thakur appeared for the petitioner Rakesh.\nState was represented through Additional Public Prosecutor (APP) Manoj Pant."}

Since there is nothing on record except the said post which indicates his such intention therefore, considering the fact that he himself belongs to the Hindu community, and so also the fact that he posted it from his own mobile number without concealing his identity, it appears that his intention was just to promote the product of his company and not to hurt the religious feelings and sentiments of any community,\" the Court held in the order.\nThe Court also did not accept the argument that the advertisement was obscene.\n\"Upon perusal of the alleged post, it is apparent that the contents of the same are not obscene hence, ingredients of Section 67 of the Information Technology Act are also not fulfilled. In view of the above, allowing the prosecution to continue the case would amount to abuse of the process of Court, therefore, it is necessary to quash the proceedings,\" the Court opined.\nThe single-judge was seized of a petition filed by one Mahendra Tripathi, who sought to quash the FIR lodged against him under Sections 505 (public mischief) and 295A (hurting religious sentiments) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) along with the provisions of the Information Technology Act.\nTripathi had in October 2018, during the Navratri festival, posted an Ad of free condoms and pregnancy test kits for couples. He had used an image of a couple playing Garba and had posted the said Ad on WhatsApp groups and also on Facebook. \nThe complainant in this case, claimed that he is a Hindu and his religious sentiments were hurt by the said Ad.\nIn his defence, Tripathi argued that he himself is a Hindu and that he had no intention to promote any kind of enmity between religious groups or hurt religious sentiments. He claimed to have posted the said Ad only in good faith to lure the customers during Garba period as various condom companies themselves came up with promotional offers.\nIn its order, the Bench referred to the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Salman Khan, who was granted a similar relief for releasing his movie titled 'Loveratri' during Navarati festival.\nThe Bench, therefore, quashed the FIR and also the subsequent criminal proceedings arising out of the same.\nAdvocate RS Raghuvanshi appeared for the Applicant.\nGovernment Advocate Mamta Shandilya represented the State."}

During this face-off, the ruling dispensation started singing the National Anthem and the BJP MLAs kept shouting slogans against the TMC. \nThis, the State contended, was an insult to the National Anthem as the BJP legislators did not stand up for the same but were instead busy in sloganeering.\nSingle-judge Justice Jay Sengupta opined that whether the National Anthem should be sung amidst dharna is a 'debatable issue.'\n\"It is debatable whether in the midst of slogan shouting by either of the groups, singing of the National Anthem was in conformity with the decorum as expected in the Order pertaining to the use of National Anthem and the Special Act. It appears that the two gatherings were at some distance of each other and the gathering of the petitioners' was behind two big pillars/gate,\" the judge said in his order.\nHe further noted that the two different groups were demonstrating regarding two different issues at some distance (within the assembly premises).\n\"Therefore, it is also to be decided whether the norms set by and requirements of one gathering would automatically bind those in the other gathering,\" the judge underlined. \nThe ten MLAs have been booked under charges of wrongful restraint (section 341 of IPC) and relevant provisions of the Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971 for insulting the National Anthem. \nThe FIR was lodged on a complaint filed by the TMC members alleging that while they were singing the National Anthem in the State Assembly premises on November 29, the BJP legislators did not stand up for the same.\nThe complaint alleged that the opposition legislators wrongly confined the ruling dispensation including Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee in the assembly premises. \nIn the petition, through advocate Rajdeep Mazumdar, the MLAs contended that singing National Anthem in such a gathering was indeed indecorous as the adverse side (BJP) was shouting slogans nearby. \n\"Singing the National Anthem in such a gathering itself was a violation of the Order relating to National Anthem of India and thus becomes punishable under the Special Act. The gathering of the petitioner's was totally a different one meant for a different purpose and the participants had already started their activities,\" Mazumdar argued. \nThe advocate further pointed out that the National Anthem being sung by the ruling legislators was hardly audible to the opposition group. \n\"Singing of the National Anthem cannot be used as a ploy to deter the petitioners from continuing with such activities or to put them in further peril of getting penalised under the Special Act,\" the advocate argued further.  \nOn the other hand, senior advocate Kishore Dutta appearing for the State, apprised the bench of the fact that the prosecution has already recorded statements of the witnesses in the case.

{"ID": "id_1324", "Summary": "The Madras high Court Thursday upheld the Tamil Nadu Prohibition of Online Gambling and Regulation of Online Games Act, 2022 but ruled that its prohibitory provisions will be applicable only to games of chance and not to games of skill such as Rummy and Poker.\nA Bench of Chief Justice SV Gangapurwala and Justice PD Audikesavalu said that while the State government was free to make rules to restrict the time one spent playing online games or to set age limits for both games of chance and of skill, it can ban only games of chance and not games of skill.\nThe Court further said that the Act cannot be invoked to ban games of skill like Rummy and Poker.\n\"Certainly, online gambling can be prohibited by the State. The State has ample power to enact a legislation to prohibit online gambling and it has also the power to regulate online games of skill in the State of Tamil Nadu. In stead of resorting to regulating online games of skill, in this case, rummy and poker, the State has simply prohibited the said games. The same was in excess of its legislative competence,\" the High Court said.\nThe Court's verdict came on a batch of petitions filed by the All India Gaming Federation and several online gaming companies challenging the constitutional validity of the Act.\nThe Tamil Nadu government had earlier told the High Court that addiction to online games was \"destroying families\" and that its new Act banning all forms of online gaming was necessary to protect the citizens of the State.\nThe Act that received the Governor's assent on April 10 this year prohibits all forms of online gambling and online 'games of chance' including online Rummy and Poker.\nThe petitioners opposed the blanket ban that the Act imposes on all online games irrespective of whether those can be termed as gambling or games of chance.\nThe Gaming Federation told the Court that the TN government did not ban physical games of Rummy and Poker but only the online format of the those two games was banned.\nThe State government justified such ban by arguing that when played online, even games of skill such as Rummy and Poker involved much risks as players and gaming companies employe \"Artificial Intelligence (AI) and bots to manipulate\" results.\nThe High Court however, dismissed the above argument made by the State after noting that the latter had failed to prove that AI and bots were employed by gamers and gaming companies.\nThe Court further said that several other High Courts and the Supreme Court had already clarified that Rummy and Poker were games of skill and the TN government had failed to establish how when played online, these games transformed into games of chance.\n“The State, in the impugned Act, has already included the games of rummy and poker to be online games of chance merely on presumption. The same cannot be protected. The same would be contrary to the judgments of the Apex Court and of this Court, discussed supra. In view of that, it will have to be held that the inclusion of the games, rummy and poker, in the Schedule of the Act is erroneous, does not stand to reason and the said Schedule deserves to be set aside. The corruption or mischief in a game may not define the game. Of course, in an isolated case, if it is noticed by the State that the petitioners or any other online games servers, online games providers are using bots or have indulged in any illegal activity, it can take action against it. However, to dub online games of rummy and poker as games of chance would be against the dictum of the Apex Court and the various High Courts,” the Court said.\nThe Court went on to say that the State government was free to make regulations as contemplated under Section 5 of the Act to impose reasonable regulations on time limit to ensure a player did not go on playing endlessly, to impose strict checks to ensure that no one below the age of 18 was permitted to play these games online, and also to take action in any case where it did find that AI, bots, or any other illegal methods were being employed to manipulate players and results of the online games.\nIt accordingly, partly allowed the pleas filed by the Federation and the online gaming companies.\n\"In the light of the aforesaid, the writ petitions, as such, stand partly allowed. The prayer to declare the entire impugned Act of 2022 as ultra vires is negated. The Schedule of the impugned Act, including the games of rummy and poker, are set aside. Sections 2(i) and 2(l)(iv) of the impugned Act shall be read as restricted to games of chance and not games involving skill, viz., rummy and poker,\" the Court said.\nSenior Advocate Kapil Sibal, Advocate General R Shunmugasundaram and Additional Advocate General Amit Anand Tiwari appeared for the Tamil Nadu government.\nSenior Advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi along with advocates Suhaan Mukerji, Abhishek Manchanda, Arun Mohan, Ashwini Vaidyalingam and Harsh Gursahani from PLR Chambers appeared for another petitioner, Gameskraft Technologies.\nAdvocates Akhil Anand and Himanshu Vij from DSK Legal appeared for petitioner companies Head Digital Works, Play Games 24x7, and Junglee Games.\nSenior Advocates Saish Parasaran, V Raghavachari, Aryama Sundaram, Mukul Rohatgi, Sajan Poovayya and advocate Deepika Murali also appeared for the petitioners.\nSenior Advocates Sundaram and Poovayya were briefed by Pradeep Nayak, Anupama Hebbar, Sankeerth Vittal and Karan Gupta of Keystone Partners on behalf of the lead petitioner, the All India Gaming Federation."}

{"ID": "id_1332", "Summary": "If small disputes in a marriage are viewed as 'cruelty' by courts under divorce law, then many marriages would risk being dissolved even if there is no actual cruelty by either spouse, the Allahabad High Court recently observed.\nJustices Saumitra Dayal Singh and Shiv Shanker Prasad made the observation while directing the judicial separation of an estranged married couple instead of directly allowing a plea for divorce. \n\"If courts were to recognize and act on small disputes or occurrences and read them as completion of ingredients of cruelty, many marriages where parties may not be enjoying best relations may stand exposed to dissolution without any real cruelty being committed,\" the Court's order stated.\nThe Court also said that if a person accuses her or his spouse of having an extramarital affair, the allegation must be clearly stated and not implied or left to the court's imagination during divorce proceedings.\n“To infer existence of illicit relationship, it is not to be left to the imagination of the Court what the parties may have intended to say by way of fact allegation. The allegation of one party having illicit relationship with another must be clear,\" the Court observed in its November 3 order.\nBy way of background, the couple married in 2013. The husband submitted that the wife refused to consummate their marriage, fought with his parents and once instigated a mob to chase him by calling him a thief. She also filed a dowry case against him, the Court was told. \nThey lived together until July 2014 but did not cohabit thereafter, he submitted. Later, the husband sought divorce from a family court citing cruelty by the wife.\nThe wife, meanwhile, accused the husband of having an illicit relationship with his sister-in-law.\nAfter a family court declined to allow the husband's plea for divorce, he moved an appeal before the High Court.\nThe High Court said that considering minor incidents and disputes as \"cruelty\" could lead to the dissolution of many marriages. In order to constitute marital cruelty, the act has to be serious enough to hinder any efforts are reconciliation. \n“Cruelty is not defined under the Act yet it has to be an act serious enough as may not allow a prudent person an opportunity or conviction to resolve matrimonial discord being faced by them or as may not burden them to continue to live in matrimony. Such acts, by very nature must included things or occurrences of very serious nature having deleterious effect on the relationship such as may be seen to prevent the parties to seek reconciliation,” the Court explained. \nIn this case, the Court noted that there seemed to be some credence to the husband's claim that his estranged wife had instigated a mob to chase after him to cause him embarrassment. \n“To instigate a mob on a false allegation only for the purposes of causing embarrassment may never be accepted as normal conduct. At the same time, no formal arrest was made and no FIR was lodged on such false allegation. Thus, it may not complete the ingredients of cruelty that are necessary to be established for the purposes of grant of decree of divorce,” the Court added.\nThe Court also noted that the wife had only alleged that her husband was having an affair because he slept in the same room as his sister-in-law and her children. Inferring an illicit relationship on the basis of this aspect alone would not be justified, the Court said. \nAll the same, the bench noted that there were serious disputes between the warring spouses, that their marriage was never consummated and that there was little scope for their reconciliation. \nHence, the Court proceeded to allow the parities to separate, instead of dissolving the marriage at the present stage. \n\"We find that the learned court below has erred in not considering the grant of alternative relief in terms of section 13A of the (Hindu Marriage) Act. The dispute between the parties having arisen immediately after their marriage and it being a proven fact that their marriage has neither been consummated nor they have cohabited for nine years clearly indicates lack of bond and/ or healthy relationship between the parties,\" the Court observed.\nConsequently, the Court granted a decree of judicial separation to the appellant-husband.\nAdvocate Satish Chaturvedi represented appellant (husband).

{"ID": "id_1335", "Summary": "The Delhi High Court on Wednesday rejected a plea by a man claiming to be suffering from azoospermia (a form of male infertility) who had sought blood samples from his wife and minor child to test the child’s paternity and support his allegations of adultery by the wife.\nA Division Bench of Justices Rajiv Shakdher and Amit Bansal rejected the plea after observing that the child was born while the couple was living together as husband and wife. Therefore, there is a presumption in favour of legitimacy of the child as per Section 112 of The Indian Evidence Act, 1872, the Court explained. \n“In this case, concededly, the disputants/couple lived together as husband and wife between 2008 and 2019. Given this undeniable fact, the presumption in favour of legitimacy under Section 112 of the Evidence Act springs forth qua the minor child. What also weighs against the appellant/husband is that he chose not to question the paternity of the child till November 2020, when an application was preferred to seek amendments in the divorce action instituted by him,\" the Court said. \nThe Bench observed that whether the wife had been involved in an adulterous relationship, as alleged by the husband, is an aspect that will have to be decided after trial.\nWhile making this allegation against his wife, the husband had claimed that he suffered from azoospermia, which is a medical term used to denote a condition where there are no sperms in a person's ejaculate (semen).\nThe Court observed that there are many causes for azoospermia, some of which are treatable, while in other cases, it is possible to retrieve a live sperm, which can be used in assisted reproductive techniques such as IVF.\nTherefore, the Court opined that it was in the realm of possibility, despite the husband’s assertion to the contrary, that the child bears his paternity.\n“In our opinion, the appellant/husband cannot, by a sidewind, impact the interest of the child who is not a party to the proceedings. The Family Court would have to take into account the evidence that the parties may lead to arrive at a conclusion, as suggested by the appellant/husband, that the respondent/wife had sexual intercourse voluntarily with a person other than the appellant/husband. Whether or not the respondent/wife had had an adulterous relationship could be gone into without subjecting the child to a paternity test,\" the Court added. \nThe husband had approached the High Court after a family court rejected his application for a direction to the wife and minor child to give their blood samples.\nThe husband had sought to conduct a paternity test with the blood samples, to establish the wife’s allegedly adulterous conduct and the use of the child as a \"pawn.\"\nThe husband had filed a petition for divorce on January 31, 2020 on grounds of cruelty. On November 3, 2020, he moved an application seeking an amendment to his divorce petition and sought to incorporate paragraphs that would establish that he was suffering from azoospermia. Hence, he argued that the child purportedly born from his wedlock with his estranged wife did not bear the imprint of his paternity.\nThe initial amendment was allowed by the trial court subject to deposit of costs of ₹3000. \nLater, on January 30, 2023, the husband moved another application seeking directions that his wife and child should be asked to give their blood samples so that the minor child’s paternity could be ascertained.\nFamily court rejected this application citing Section 112 of the Evidence Act.\nAfter considering the case, the High Court found no reason to interfere with the family court order and dismissed the husband's challenge to the said order.\nAdvocate Ashish Negi appeared for the appellant-husband.\nNone appeared for the wife."}

Sections 24 and 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act are enacted with the object of removing the handicap of a wife or husband with no independent income sufficient for living or meeting litigation expenses; such a relief can be granted to the husband as well, who may also be deprived of the same,\" the Court said in the order passed on September 19.\nThe Hindu Marriage Act, the bench stated, is a complete code which provides for the rights, liabilities and obligations arising from a marriage between two Hindus. \nThe bench was hearing an appeal filed by a wife challenging a decision of a Family Court in Nanded.\nIt was her argument that the Family Court didn't decide her application filed under Section 24 and instead directly decided the divorce petition filed by her husband. \nShe pointed out that the Family Court in its judgment had reasoned that she was absent for several hearings and, thus, the divorce was decreed in her husband's favor. \nThe husband, on the other hand, highlighted the fact that the wife herself left the matrimonial house way back in 2005 after subjecting him and his family to cruelty. He pointed out that the Family Court had initially rejected her plea for maintenance and had only ordered him to pay ₹3,000 towards his children, who are in the wife's custody. \nHaving heard the contentions, the bench noted that it was not the wife alone who was absent for hearings but the husband was also guilty of the same on several occasions. \nIt also noted that the wife's plea under Section 24 of the Act wasn't decided within the timeline of 60 days.\n\"The opportunity of defending herself was also not given to the appellant. Admittedly, the provision under Section 24 is a benevolent provision enacted with the object to provide relief by way of maintenance and litigation expenses to the spouse.

Therefore, this is a fit case to remand back the matter to the Family Court for deciding the proceedings afresh,\" the bench added. \nIt, therefore, ordered the Family Court to consider the divorce petition afresh by granting opportunity to both the husband as well as the wife to adduce evidence and support their clams.

The hotel booking was for five dates in December 2021 for a vacation with his wife and daughter.\nHowever, just three days before he was set to check in, his booking was canceled on the ground that the hotel was “un-operational” and that the room was not available. An amount of ₹10,432 was refunded.\nInterestingly, the complainant found that the same rooms of the hotel were available for the same dates but for exorbitant rates of ₹27,207. Thus, he approached the Commission.\nMakeMyTrip in its response to the Commission said that it was merely an intermediary and a facilitator between the complainant, the hotel and the hospitality service provider Oyo. \nSimilarly, Oyo said its role was only limited to arranging the booking through its platform and that the rest of the operational liability was on the owner of the hotel.\nAfter hearing the parties, the Commission said it was evident that due to heavy rush at the hotel, the price of the room was being increased every day as there were a number of customers in line to get the same booked room even at a higher price.\n“But in our opinion the complainant hired the services of OPs in advance just with this reason only that at the peak season it will be impossible for him to meet the budget,” it added.\nFinding that MakeMyTrip and other opposite parties failed to justify the cancellation of the complainant’s booking and the subsequent availability of the same room at exorbitant rates, the Commission allowed the complaint with directions for compensation.\nAdvocate Vageesh Marwaha represented the complainant.

{"ID": "id_1347", "Summary": "The Supreme Court on Friday ruled that Bachelor of Education (B.Ed) candidates are ineligible to hold primary school teacher posts. [Devesh Sharma v. Union of India and ors]\nA Bench of Justices Aniruddha Bose and Sudhanshu Dhulia upheld a Rajasthan High Court decision to quash a 2018 National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) notification allowing B.Ed candidates to be primary school teachers.\nThe Court made it clear that B.Ed is in no terms a qualification to teach at the primary level (classes I to V).\n\"The decision of the NCTE to include B.Ed. as a qualification for teachers in a primary school seems arbitrary, unreasonable and in fact has no nexus with the object sought to be achieved by the Act i.e. Right to Education Act, which is to give to children not only free and compulsory but also ‘quality’ education.\"\nThe top court further emphasised that elementary education is a fundamental right under Article 21A of the Constitution.\n\"Free and compulsory education for children becomes meaningless if we make compromise on its ‘quality’. We must recruit the best qualified teachers. A good teacher is the first assurance of ‘quality’ education in a school. Any compromise on the qualification of teachers would necessarily mean a compromise on the ‘quality’ of education,\" the judgment said.\nAfter the High Court quashed the notification, the NCTE, certain B.Ed candidates, eligible diploma holders and the Union government moved the top court in appeal.\nThe Supreme Court noted that as per NCTE norms, the necessary qualification for primary teacher posts was a Diploma in Elementary Education (D.El.Ed.).\n\"A candidate who has a diploma in elementary education (D.El.Ed.) is trained to handle students at this level, as he has undergone a pedagogical course specifically designed for this purpose ... A person who has a B.Ed. qualification has been trained to impart teaching to secondary and higher secondary level of students. He is not expected to impart training to primary level students,\" the Bench explained.\nIt added that the NCTE notification was flawed since it relied on a communication from the Central government with respect to Kendriya Vidyalayas. The Central government had earlier written to the NCTE asking it to allow B.Ed teachers to hold primary teacher posts in view of a shortage in candidates.\nThe Court, however, stressed that B.Ed and diploma in education holders cannot be equated.\n\"B.Ed. is not a qualification for teaching at Primary level of classes, much less a better or higher qualification, in context of Primary classes. This finding is self-evident in the very admission of NCTE which mandates that all B.Ed. qualified teachers who are appointed to teach Primary level classes must mandatorily undergo a pedagogical course for elementary classes within two years of their appointment.\"\nIt added that \"policy decisions\" of the Central government that usually bind the NCTE can be reviewed if they are arbitrary and irrational.\n\"The decision to include B.Ed. as a qualification is not an independent decision of NCTE, but it was the decision of the Central Government and NCTE was simply directed to carry it out ... in the larger context of the matter, we cannot even see this as a policy decision ... we must say that this decision is not correct as it is contrary to the purpose of the (Right to Education) Act,\" the bench said.\nThe Central government's decision had failed to take into consideration 'objective realities', the Court added.\nThe appeals were accordingly dismissed.\nSenior Advocates PS Patwalia and Meenakshi Arora appeared for the various B.Ed qualified candidates.\nSenior Advocate Kapil Sibal represented the Diploma holders.\nSenior Advocate Manish Singhvi represented the Rajasthan government.\nAdditional Solicitors General Aishwarya Bhati and Vikramjeet Banerjee represented the Central government."}

The marks are confusingly and deceptively similar to Cadbury’s, the Court was informed.\nThough the defendant had initially entered appearance, the suit later proceeded ex-parte and the defendant did not file documents to support their case, except a few raw invoices which dated back to the years 2001-2002.\nThe High Court held that the Gems product is usually consumed by children and the test in such a matter is not of absolute confusion.\nTherefore, a comparison of the defendant’s infringing product and package of Cadbury’s product leaves no doubt that the former is a complete knock-off of Gems, Justice Singh said.\n“The significant fact is that these products are sold not only in bigger packs, but also in smaller pillow packs, due to which the mark may not even be fully visible. The smallest selling unit of the Plaintiffs’ product i.e., the pillow pack, is even available for 1 rupee to 5 rupees. Hence, the product’s get up, layout, as also, the colour combination of the packaging plays a significant role at the point of purchase,\" the order said. \nJustice Singh concluded that not only did the defendant infringe the plaintiff’s trademark, but it also constituted passing off and they are entitled to damages.\nThe Court, therefore, directed Neeraj Food Products to pay an actual cost of ₹15.86 lakh to Cadbury within three months.\nAdvocate Prakriti Vaishney appeared for Cadbury."}

Thus, it was irrelevant whether a civic authority or a private party was carrying out redevelopment, it was contended. \nThe petitioners, therefore, sought an order setting aside the demand notices issued by the planning authorities imposing an amount collectively to the tune of over ₹800 crores on all petitioners.\nThey also sought a refund of such amounts which had been deposited under protest till the petitions were to be finally decided.\nAdvocate General Ashutosh Kumbhakoni and advocate Akshay Shinde, appearing for the State and the MHADA, pointed out that development charges by the planning authority were in the nature of fee and not tax.\nHe argued that exemption could be claimed under Section 124F only if the land owned by these authorities is sought to be developed by such authorities itself, for their own benefits and for their own purposes and not by others proposing to carry out redevelopment on such lands.\nSenior Advocate Aspi Chinoy and advocate Joel Carlos for BMC opposed the petitions contending that lands vested with them could not be equated with ownership, and Section 124F provides exemption only in that strict sense.\nThe Court deduced from the submissions that even if the lands may be owned by either the State or the planning authorities, upon redevelopment of these plots by the developer, the building would be owned by either the society or occupants for whose benefit these buildings would be developed.\nIt, therefore, agreed with the contentions raised by AG and Chinoy and hence dismissed the petitions."}

{"ID": "id_1360", "Summary": "The Nagpur Bench of the Bombay High Court allowed a divorce plea by a husband on the ground of cruelty by wife after she levelled fake allegations against him and uploaded her profile on matrimonial websites during the pendency of divorce proceedings.\nA Division Bench of Justices AS Chandurkar and GA Sanap held that the wife’s wild and unfounded allegations as well as her conscious decision to remarry during the pendency of the divorce petition by uploading her profile on two matrimonial websites were enough to prove that the appellant-husband suffered mental cruelty.\nThe Bench was hearing an appeal against the order of a family court at Akola which had rejected the plea of divorce by husband and only granted judicial separation for one year.\nBefore the family court, the husband stated that his wife was aggressive, would lie to him, quarrel, and had an affinity towards her parents’ residence in Akola. She was keen to shift there and insisted that the appellant quit his job to comply with this demand. \nHowever, he had a permanent job in the High Court and therefore, refused to quit his job and shift. His wife even made complaints of cruelty and domestic violence before the Magistrate making his life miserable, causing him unbearable harassment and mental cruelty, it was alleged.\nOn the other hand, the wife denied these allegations and claimed that she was harassed for dowry, made to do all the household work, was beaten and tortured and not given meals. \nAfter hearing the parties the family court found that the appellant had established a case of cruelty at the hands of his wife but refused to grant divorce. \nAggrieved by the order, the appellant moved the High Court.\nDuring the hearing before the High Court, the counsel for the appellant brought to the Bench’s attention that the respondent had made her intention of parting ways with appellant clear, by uploading her profile on two matrimonial websites, BharatMatrimony.com and Shaadi.com and that the Family Court did not consider those facts while adjudicating the dispute.\nTo clarify the jurisprudence developed by the Supreme Court while deciding cases of cruelty by wife against her husband, the High Court relied on the following judgments.\nIn Dr. (Mrs.) Malathi Ravi, M.D. vs. Dr. B. V. Ravi, M.D, it was held that if the wife has no intention to lead a normal life, then on the ground of mental cruelty the decree for divorce can be granted. It was further held that the false allegations by one spouse against the other amounts to mental cruelty.\nIn Vishwanath S/o. Sitaram Agrawal vs.Sarla Vishwanath Agrawal, the Supreme Court had held that mental torture caused by one spouse to the another by making wild and false allegations in a report lodged to the authority as well as in the electronic and print media constitute a mental cruelty and as such the ground for divorce.\nIn V Bhagat vs. Mrs. D. Bhagat, the Court found that mental cruelty in Section 131 (i-a) can broadly be defined as that conduct which inflicts upon the other party such mental pain and suffering as would make it impossible for that party to live with the other. It is held that the mental cruelty must be of such a nature that the parties cannot reasonably be expected to live together.\nAfter discussing the precedents, the Court proceeded to examine the conduct of the respondent during the pendency of the divorce petition.\nThe Court noted that on perusal of the matrimonial profiles created by the wife, it was clear that even before the divorce petition was decided, the respondent had made up her mind to enter into a second marriage and had uploaded her profile on two websites.\n“In our opinion, the respondent by uploading her profile on two matrimonial websites made her intention writ large. On the basis of this document it can be inferred that she wanted to get rid of the appellant and wanted to perform the second marriage.”\nThe High Court also specifically pointed out that the respondent’s conduct was inconsistent with the facts stated by her in the written statement where she contended that she was an obedient wife and daughter-in-law, but the appellant and his parents did not like her and wanted to get rid of her.\nFurther, it was observed that the respondent made serious and wild allegations against the appellant and his parents by way of an FIR and her application under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act.\nIn light of these observations, the Court held that the family court did not consider the evidence regarding matrimonial websites while deciding the matter and in concluding that though cruelty was established, it would not be harmful or injurious for him to live with the wife.\n“The learned Judge, as can be seen on perusal of the impugned judgment, has not taken into consideration the documentary evidence produced before delivering judgment with regard to the uploading of her marriage profile on the two matrimonial websites. The learned Judge without assigning a convincing reason denied the decree of divorce,” the High Court said.\nFurther, the Court observed that the evidence on record proves that the respondent inflicted upon the appellant mental pain and sufferings which would make it impossible for him to live with the respondent and the mental cruelty is such that it would in all probability cause injury to the health of the appellant.\nThe Bench also remarked that the respondent had made it amply clear that she had no wish or desire to continue in the company of the appellant through her conduct.\n“If the respondent had sincere wish and desire to save her marriage she would not have taken a conscious decision to perform the second marriage even before the final out come of the divorce petition.”\nTherefore, it was held that the judgments discussed squarely applied to the case at hand and the appellant was entitled to divorce on the ground of the mental cruelty meted out to him by the respondent.\nAdvocate Hemant Surve appeared for the appellant."}
{"ID": "id_1362", "Summary": "\"The investigation is at preliminary stage and if the accused is released on bail then s/he will tamper the prosecution evidence\", reasoned the Special NDPS Court while rejecting the bail pleas preferred by Rhea Chakraborty and her brother, Showik Chakraborty, both of whom have been accused of having being involved in the procurement of drugs for the late actor, Sushant Singh Rajput.\nWhereas the bail pleas were rejected on Friday, the detailed orders passed by Additional Sessions Judge GB Gurao were issued on Monday, September 14. \nIt is the prosecution's case that Showik Chakraborty had procured drugs for Sushant Singh Rajput, sometimes on the instructions of his sister, Rhea. \nRhea Chakraborty is accused of having been aware of the drug procurement for Sushant, and further, it is alleged that some of the payments made for the drugs were also using Rhea's credit card. \nPertinently, both Rhea and Showik have been accused of illicit drug trafficking under Section 27A of the NDPS Act, in respect of which the Court noted that there was an embargo on the grant of bail under Section 37 of the Act unless there are reasonable grounds to believe that accused is not guilty after having heard the Public Prosecutor. \nOn this count, the NDPS court has taken a disfavourable view and found that it is not possible to release Rhea and Showik on bail. The orders further give the following reasons:\nThere is an embargo on the grant of bail to those accused of an offence under Section 19 or Sections 24 or 27A of the NDPS Act of involving drugs of commercial quantity.\nUnder Section 27A (Punishment for financing illicit traffic and harbouring offenders) of the NDPS Act, no particular quantity of the drug is required to prove the offence.\nThere is a bar under Section 37 of NDPS Act to release the accused (both Rhea and Showik) on bail.\nWhen the investigation is at a preliminary stage, it can not be said that Rhea's/ Showik's statement regarding her alleged involvement in paying for the drugs and drug procurement is forcefully recorded.\nThe investigation is at a preliminary stage, therefore, from the available record, it can not be said that there are no reasonable grounds to connect Rhea to the case.\nIf the accused are released on bail then they would alert people and destroy the evidence. \nThere is a possibility of tampering with evidence if the accused are released on bail. \nCharges were levelled against Rhea and Showik Chakraborty and several others under the Narcotics, Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, 1985 recently. \nThe NDPS case emerged following the unnatural death of Sushant Singh Rajput, with whom Rhea had a live-in relationship, an aspect noted in the NDPS court's order as well while restating the prosecution's version of events. \nAmid the national limelight on the probe into Rajput's death, in relation to which Rhea has been named in the CBI's FIR, this NDPS case has also assumed sensational overtones. \nBoth Rhea and Showik Chakraborty were represented by Advocate Satish Maneshinde before the NDPS Court. \nWhy did NCB arrest Rhea Chakraborty?\nRead the orders:"}

They said that there was no investigation pending against them and therefore, there was no reason to transfer their assessment.\nThe IT department stated that the transfer in all these cases were within the city and only when the transfer was from one city to another, the IT officer has to give a hearing to the assessee.\nThey further said that even though the faceless assessment has come into being, it does not degrade or undo the powers of transfer available under Section 127 of the Income Tax Act.\nIn a detailed judgement, Court has held that no assessee has any fundamental or vested legal right to be assessed by a Faceless Assessing Officer.\nIt has been held that the jurisdiction of central circle’s jurisdiction is not confined to search cases only and it is conferred with the jurisdiction over non-search cases where coordinated investigation is required.\nThe Bench further said that the power to transfer cases under Section 127 of the Income Tax Act is in no manner trammelled upon or negated by the introduction of faceless assessment.\n“This Court is of the view that though in the year 2019, the concept of E-assessment and in 2020, the concept of Faceless Assessment was introduced, yet the Jurisdictional Assessing Officer continues to exercise concurrent jurisdiction with Faceless Assessing Officer,” the Court underscored.\nIt concluded that the transfer of assessments of the petitioners is not in violation of the guidelines issued by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) because the transfer has been done for the purposes of coordinated investigation.\nThe Bench also rejected the petitioners’ contention that the power of transfer under Section 127, after the faceless assessment came into force, is a two-step process.\nSenior Advocate Arvind Datar with advocates Kavita Jha, Vaibhav Kulkarni and Anant Mann appeared for Gandhis and the five charitable trusts.\nAAP was represented through advocates Amar Dave, Vivek Jain and Abhinav Jain.\nSolicitor General (SG) Tushar Mehta, Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Balbir Singh and Senior Standing Counsel Zoheb Hossain along with advocates Vipul Agarwal, Sanjeev Menon, Prasanjeet Mohapatra, Shyam Gopal, Vivek Gurnani and Monica Benjimin appeared for the Income Tax department."}

The right to food with hygiene is also concomitant to Article 21 of the Constitution, as the right to food itself is. Article 21 would also envelope in it a right to safe food. This would represent the other side of the coin when the meat vendors would insist for doing business even the meat is unstamped meat or that the slaughter house is not licensed or the norms compliant,\" the bench observed. \nThe bench, therefore, refused relief in a slew of applications filed by meat and chicken shop owners seeking permission to continue their businesses, which they said were shut by the civic authorities. \nThe shops were shut on orders of the High Court passed in a public interest litigation (PIL) petition alleging that they were operating in violation of various mandatory norms. \nThe PIL petition sought implementation of the Supreme Court judgment and also the provisions of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, which mandate that animals be slaughtered only in licensed slaughter houses. \nAs per the PIL petition, thousands of shops across Gujarat were selling 'unstamped' meat, which would mean meat not procured from slaughter houses but procured by killing animals in the local shops only.\nThe shop owners, however, argued that they have the right to carry on their own business and thus their profession must be protected. \nThe bench, in its judgment, said that the right to business is not an absolute right. \n\"Right to freedom of trade may be a fundamental right, but not a carte blanche. The laws are enacted and operate in public good and public interest. The freedom to trade or right to do business have to yield the public health norms and the restrictive compulsions needed to be enforced in larger public good. The right to free trade in food items like meat, or any such food has to be subserving to public health and food safety requirements,\" the bench observed. \nThe applicant shop owners cannot be permitted to assert unrestricted freedom to do business in meat or to run slaughter houses on the ground of religious occasion, when they are otherwise non-compliant of the norms in law, the Court underlined.\n\"The applicants cannot draw for them such unrestricted right to do the business on the canvass. A bare ground may not be permitted to be advanced to justify to seek laxity in the food safety or pollution norms. The activity of running unlicensed slaughter houses and selling unstamped meat could not be approved or permitted without the stakeholders complying the applicable laws,\" the bench added. \nIt also noted that the applicants had not challenged any of the provisions of the Acts or Regulations based on which action was taken against them. \nThe provisions of Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 and the Food Safety Regulations imposing restrictions on the meat shops to maintain hygiene and other standards, are reasonable restrictions on the right of the vendors of the meat and slaughter house owners to run their business, the Court said. \nIt further noted that all slaughter houses and meat shops wee not ordered to be closed down and those shops complying with the norms have been permitted to run their business.\n\"Even the shops and premises owners who are given the show cause notice or whose shops are ordered to be closed, could meet with the requirements of law and after fulfilling the norms, may approach the competent authority seeking to reopen their business premises or shops,\" the bench added. \nSenior Advocate Percy Kavina along with advocates Ejaz Qureshi, Hashim Qureshi and Rizvan Shaikh appeared for the Shop Owners. \nSenior Advocate Asim Pandya along with advocate Jay Shah appeared for the PIL Petitioner. \nGovernment Pleader Manisha Lavkumar Shah along with advocates Chintan Dave and KM Antani represented the State."}

On her complaint to the higher-ups of the bank, a decision was taken by the higher authorities on an 'administrative basis' to transfer the complainant to Tripura, the Court was told.\nThe HR manager also noted that officers with more than five years of experience in a station were normally transferred under the bank's transfer policy and that the complainant had completed six years in Birbhum.\nThe manager added that he was not on the Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) panel and was not involved in the decision to transfer the complainant.\nThe bench ultimately quashed the criminal charges, terming it an abuse of the court process that was meant to wreak vengeance.\nThe Court also criticised the magistrate who entertained the criminal complaint. The High Court found that the order of the magistrate did not record that a prima facie case had been made out against the manager and that summons had been issued without verifying the complaint.\n\"It is settled law that the order of cognizance which forms the very basis of initiation of proceeding cannot be made in a mechanical way but it requires great exercise of judicial mind.

{"ID": "id_1372", "Summary": "The Bombay High Court recently granted guardianship of a minor to her biological parents after she was deemed to be an illegitimate child as a result of being born out of marriage [Sudeep Suhas Kulkarni and Anr. vs Abbas Bahadur Dhanani].\nJustice Manish Pitale said that a situation where a minor child, for no fault of hers is left high and dry cannot be accepted and therefore, keeping the interest of the minor child as the paramount consideration, the Court can favourably consider the plea.\n\"Such a situation where the minor child, for no fault of hers, is left high and dry, cannot be countenanced and therefore, this Court is of the opinion that keeping the interest of the minor child as the paramount consideration, the present petition can be favourably considered,\" the Court said.\nThe petition was filed by biological parents of the minor child. \nThe mother of the minor was a Hindu by birth. in 2005, she converted to Islam and married the respondent. During their marriage, the minor was born and was deemed to be their child.\nAccordingly, the child was deemed to be a Muslim and the same was recorded in her birth certificate.\nLater it came to light that the respondent was not the biological father of the child and the respondent and the minor's mother separated. In 2005, they got divorced. \nThe custody of the child was granted to the mother and the respondent expressed no interest in the custody, care or guardianship of the minor.\nHowever, since the child was born during the marriage of the petitioner and the respondent, Shia laws applied to her.\nIn accordance with Shia Law, illegitimate children are considered to have no ‘nasab’ (descent) and neither parent of such minor is considered as a guardian. The same implies that the status of such an illegitimate child is equivalent to that of an orphan.\nResultantly, despite having both biological parents, such illegitimate children are not granted status, title, rights or inheritance of property of either parent.\nThe advocates for the petitioners submitted that this in itself was violative of the rights of the minor and caused prejudice to her despite no fault of hers due to the harshness of the prevailing personal laws.\nFurther, they relied on judgements of the Supreme Court and various high courts wherein the courts had taken the view that in all cases, the welfare of the minor is of paramount consideration and the same would take precedence over personal laws.\nTherefore, they prayed that the Court exercise its powers under Section 7 and Section 15 under the Guardians and Wards Act and declare the petitioners as the guardians of the minor. The respondent consented to the same and provided his no objection affidavit which was filed with the registry.\nThe Court noted that in Athar Hussain vs. Syed Siraj Ahmed and Ors. the Supreme Court held that if there is a conflict between the provisions of personal law and the provisions of the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890, by keeping the interest of the minor child as the paramount consideration, the Court can proceed on the basis that the provisions of the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890 would prevail over the personal law.\nFurther, it noted that applying the principles of the Mahommedan Law strictly to the facts of the case would deprive the minor child of inheritance and basic rights, only because she is the product of a relationship between petitioner No.1 and petitioner No.2, during the subsistence of the marriage between petitioner No.2 and the respondent.\nTherefore, it stated that it would be a travesty of justice if the prayers made in the petition are not considered.\n\"This Court is of the opinion that since the petitioners in the present case are the biological parents and there is sufficient material placed on record to show that petitioner No.1 is the biological father of the minor child, it would be a travesty of justice if the prayers made in the present petition are not considered, merely because the personal law applicable to the minor child indicates that being an ‘illegitimate child’,\" the Court said.\nHence, the Court granted the guardianship of the minor to her biological parents.\nThe petitioners were represented by counsel Gauraj Shah and advocates Priyanka Sinha and Simran Grover of A&P Partners."}

Once the competent Court passed the decree of divorce, the marital status of the husband and wife is snapped and the pre-requisite condition of section 498-A 'being the husband' or 'relatives of the husband' disappears,\" the Court held.\nThe Court made the observation while quashing a Section 498A case lodged by a divorced woman nearly 20 months after her divorce. The complaint was filed against her ex-husband as well as his family. \nAmong other allegations, the complainant-woman alleged that her former husband was guilty of adultery on account of his second marriage after their divorce.\nImportantly, the Court found that the former wife had not made any specific allegation indicating cruelty or harassment while the marriage existed.\n\"What appears from the bare reading of the FIR is that the complainant was aggrieved on the ground that her former husband remarried subsequent to divorce decree ... The complainant has also not mentioned as to how she was physically and mentally harassed by the petitioners. The allegations levelled are in general form,\" the bench found.\nThe Court proceeded to quash the case after opining that the case appeared to have been lodged to wreak vengeance and as a counter blast to the divorce decree.\n\"The impugned FIR on its bare face indicates that it is filed against former husband and his relatives by divorcee wife.

Such a restriction will be violative of Article 15.

{"ID": "id_1382", "Summary": "State is not competent to levy water cess on Hydropower generation under guise of water usage, the Himachal Pradesh High Court held on Tuesday while quashing the Himachal Pradesh Water Cess on Hydropower Electricity Generation Act, 2023 [NHPC Ltd v. State of HP & Ors].\nA division bench of Justice Tarlok Singh Chauhan and Justice Satyen Vaidya ruled that the State legislature lacked the competence to enact a law for levy of cess on water usage for generation of electricity since hydroelectricity and water power is a field occupied by the parliament. \n\"The provisions of the Himachal Pradesh Water Cess on Hydropower Electricity Generation Act, 2023, are declared to be beyond the legislative competence of the State Government in terms of Articles 246 and 265 of the Constitution of India and, thus, ultra vires the Constitution,\" the Court held.\nThe Court said that the Act imposes tax on generation of electricity and not merely on water as a subject or on drawl of water, which the State is not competent to do. \n\"It also imposes an inter-State tax on inter-State supply of electricity for which again the State is not competent to do so,\" the Court added.\nHence, it quashed the law and ordered refund of the amount recovered from the power generation companies. \nIt opined that the law essentially taxes the generation of electricity, after it found that the height from which the water falls was set as a determining factor for the rate of cess.\n“It is “generation of electricity” that is the “bone” and “water drawn” is only the “flesh”. The taxable event is “hydropower generation” and not the “usage of water” because if there is no generation, then there is no “tax”. Moreover, if the cess was on “usage of water”, then how could the height, at which the water falls on the turbine, be made the taxable event?” asked the Court. \nHimachal government had introduced The Himachal Pradesh Water Cess on Hydropower Generation Act in 2023 with an aim to improve its revenue generation by imposing water cess on hydro power generation. \nThere were 172 hydropower projects in the State when the law was passed by the assembly. However, it faced stiff opposition from the power generation companies.\nA total of 39 petitions were filed before the High Court by the power companies including public sector companies like NHPC Limited.\nThe power generation companies had mainly contended that the State lacked the legislative competence to frame a law to levy cess on water usage for generation of electricity.\nThe State's defence was that since water is a State’s subject matter and comes under Entry 17 of List-II, it has the legislative competence to make such law.\nUnion of India had supported the stand of power generation companies.\nThe Court on consideration of the submissions rejected the State’s reliance on Entries 17 and 18 of the List-II.\n“In this regard, it is a settled principle of law that taxation entries are distinct from general regulatory entries. Entries 1 to 44 in List-II are regulatory, whereas Entries 45 to 63 are taxing entries. Therefore, the legislative competence to impose any tax on water drawn for hydropower generation cannot be imposed by the State by referring to Entries 17 & 18 of List-II being regulatory entry,” it noted.\nThe Court also refused to accept the State’s alternative argument that the levy can be justified as a ‘fee’ on the basis of Entries 17 and 18 read with Entry 66 of List-II.\nIt opined that the State lacks the competence to levy the cess as a fee. \nFurther, the Court found that the entire field of legislation concerning water power or hydropower projects under the Electricity Act of 2003 is occupied by parliament. \n“Therefore, the State lacks competence to levy any fee under the garb of water cess by relying upon Entries 17 & 18, and 66 of List-II,” it concluded.\nIn conclusion, the Court said that once it is held that the cess sought to be imposed by the Act is not on the “water drawn” but on the “generation of electricity”, then it is the Central Government alone which could levy tax on generation of electricity.\nThe Court also found that the power of fixation of rates has been delegated to the Himachal Pradesh government i.e., the executive by the State legislature without any guidance.\n\"On account of having delegated power to fix rates of impugned levy to Government of Himachal Pradesh without any legislative policy or guidance, the impugned Act is unconstitutional,\" the Court said.\nSenior Advocate Tushar Mehta with Advocates Vijay Kumar Arora and Avneesh Arputtham represented the NHPC Limited.\nSenior Advocates Abhishek Manu Singhvi and RL Sood with Advocates HS Chandoke, Anant Garg and Janesh Gupta represented JSW Hydro Energy Limited\nSenior Advocate Dushyant Dave, advocate General Anup Rattan, Senior Additional Advocate Generals IN Mehta and Yashwardhan Chauhan, Additional Advocate Generals Navlesh Verma and Sharmila Patial and Deputy Advocate General JS Guleria represented the State."}
{"ID": "id_1386", "Summary": "The Meghalaya High Court on Tuesday ordered the deployment of the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF) to monitor and stop illegal coal mining in the State. [In Re Suo Motu Illegal Mining of Coal in the State of Meghalaya]\nA Full Bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justices HS Thangkhiew and W Diengdoh said that given the abundance of rain in the region and limestone being prone to water erosion, there was a tragedy waiting to happen in the aftermath of unscientific extraction of coal and limestone.\n\"Without intending to sound apocalyptic or seeking to toll the knell of an imminent doomsday, it takes no rocket science to realise that the recipe is ripe for disaster. The pot is on the boil and it is brewing a calamitous broth. Yet the lure of a quick buck prompts the sentinel to look the other way,\" the Court said.\nThe Court was hearing a suo motu public interest litigation (PIL) on the practice of illegal coal mining that has continued unabated in the State.\nIt said that the State not fulfilling its obligation of checking illegal activity was contrary to the rule of law.\n\"It is only upon each discovery of illegal activity being made by this Court that the State responds by assuring the Court that steps would be taken to dismantle the illegal machinery; but the illegal activity mushrooms somewhere else and the State awaits the Court’s further direction before undertaking the work that the State itself is obliged to take up. It is a really sorry state of affairs and an affront to the rule of law,\" the order stated.\nConsidering that the State had fallen short despite being afforded a year to take appropriate measures, the Court deemed it necessary to call in the CAPF to monitor and stop the illegal mining.\n\"In the current scenario and considering that the State has been afforded nearly a year to take appropriate measures and the measures adopted by the State have fallen woefully short, it is necessary to call in the Central Armed Police Forces to monitor and stop the illegal activities pertaining to coal mining that continues in the State,\" it said.\nFormer Gauhati High Court judge, Justice BP Katakey, who was earlier appointed to head a committee to advise the State government on the issue, was tasked by the Court with overseeing the disposal of previously mined coal and to ensure that recently illegally mined coal was not passed off as previously mined coal.\nHe filed a report on February 6, referring to illegal coal mining and the steps taken by him pursuant to a newspaper report depicting how three mine workers had reportedly died inside a coal mine in Rymbai in the East Jaintia Hills district.\nThe report stated that 31 cases of illegal extraction of coal were were registered in December 2022 and January 2023 alone, and that even the rough estimates of the quantity of seized coal has not been indicated in any case. It also stated that autopsy reports of the deceased mine workers were awaited.\nThe Court said that if 31 cases had come to light, several must have been overlooked or may not have come to notice. Further, it said that the failure of local authorities to indicate the approximate quantity of seized coal left room for manipulation, which indicated that they were involved in such manipulation.\n\"For a start, if 31 cases of illegal transportation have come to light, there must have been several multiples more of illegal transportation that may either have been actively overlooked or may not have come to the notice of the appropriate personnel. Secondly, the failure to even indicate the approximate quantity of the seized coal leaves room for manipulation and there is no doubt that the local officials are involved in such manipulation.\"\nFurther, the Court said the State failing to fulfil its duty of providing alternative livelihoods or temporary support to citizens affected by the ban on unscientific coal mining indicated a lack of seriousness on its part in addressing the issue.\nHence, it directed the deployment of CAPF personnel and requested Deputy Solicitor General Dr N Mozika to take notice on behalf of the Central government. He was asked to inform the Court on February 14 about the steps taken for deployment of sufficient units of either the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) or the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) to completely take over the policing of illegal coal mining activities.\nThe cost of the deployment would have to be borne by the State \"for its abject inefficiency,\" the Court added.\nAdvocate General Amit Kumar, Senior Advocates MZ Ahmed and B Dutta, Senior Government Advocate K Khan and Advocates R Colney, A Pradhan and N Syngkon appeared for the State.\nIn February last year, the Court had taken suo motu cognisance of a newspaper article highlighting the prevalence of rat-hole mining in the State's West Khasi Hills district.\nThe Shillong Times article gave a detailed description of how in the Nengchigen village bordering the South Garo Hills District, 'rat-hole mining” was happening in a widespread manner. It mentioned that a complaint has been lodged by the Nokma (village headman) of Nengchigen against certain persons, including the police, on illegal mining in clan lands.\nRat-hole mining is a practice of excavation in Meghalaya where miners go through narrow horizontal tunnels about 150 metres dug against deep vertical shafts.\nCoal mining in Meghalaya is being restored in a limited capacity in phases, after the Supreme Court in 2019 set aside a 2014 order of the National Green Tribunal that ordered a blanket ban on coal mining in the State."}

Upon contacting Reliance Digital, he was directed to an authorised service centre of HP and his keyboard was replaced. However, the laptop's performance deteriorated after a few months. \nKumar said that his requests for replacing the laptop were rejected by the service centre, citing a 14-day replacement policy. In his complaint before the consumer forum, he contended that the laptop should have been replaced as it was still within the one-year warranty period. \nHe therefore sought compensation from HP to the tune of ₹1 lakh as well as ₹25,000 towards cost of the proceedings. \nIt was while considering the material placed on record by Kumar that the consumer forum noticed the poorly printed tax invoice. \nSince HP, Reliance Digital and the service centre did not present their versions despite being issued notice, the court found no reason to disbelieve Kumar's submissions.\nAccordingly, it issued an ex-parte order directing HP to replace the laptop with a new unit of the model that Kumar had purchased.

{"ID": "id_1393", "Summary": "The Supreme Court on Thursday struck down the electoral bonds scheme introduced by the Indian government in 2018 to permit anonymous donations to political parties.\nA five-judge bench opined that black money in politics can be tackled through less drastic measures.\nTwo concurring opinions were pronounced, one by Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud on behalf of himself and Justices BR Gavai, JB Pardiwala and Manoj Misra; and another by by Justice Sanjiv Khanna.\nThe highlights of these opinions include the following.  \nMoney, politics and the right to vote\nIn CJI Chandrachud’s opinion, it was noted that there was a “close association” between money and politics, and that information about the funding of political parties was essential for voters to effectively exercise their choice to vote.\nThere is a possibility that financial contributions to a political party would lead to quid pro quo arrangements because of the close nexus between money and politics, the Court explained.\nElectoral bonds not least restrictive measure to curb black money\nThe disproportional impact of the electoral bonds scheme was a major factor which led the Court to strike down the scheme.\nThe Court noted that the electoral bonds scheme was not the only means for curbing black money in electoral financing. There are other alternatives that have a lesser impact on the right to information of voters, the Court said.\nIn other words, the Court held that the electoral bonds scheme was not proportional in its impact, since it “does not fulfill the least restrictive means test.”\nIn his concurring opinion, Justice Sanjiv Khanna also dealt extensively with the proportionality of the electoral bonds scheme. He concluded that the voters' right to know supersedes the need for anonymity in political party funding.\n“The voters right to know and access to information is far too important in a democratic set-up ... While secret ballots are integral to fostering free and fair elections, transparency—not secrecy—in funding of political parties is a prerequisite for free and fair elections. The confidentiality of the voting booth does not extend to the anonymity in contributions to political parties,” Justice Khanna held.\nRight to keep political affiliations private has its limits\nThe Court held that the citizen’s political beliefs or political affiliations are a part of their right to privacy. Political contributions are also a part of one’s political affiliations, the Court ruled.\nHowever, the bench proceeded to opine that “the right to privacy of political affiliations does not extend to contributions which may be made to influence policies.”\nThe Court explained that a balance should be struck between a voter’s right to keep their political affiliations private and the right of a voter to know about the funding of political candidates.\nWhile so, the Court concluded that the electoral bonds scheme “completely tilts the balance” in favour of the right to keep political affiliations private (“informational privacy”) while discarding the voters’ right to know (“informational interests”).\n “The Union of India has been unable to establish that the measure employed in clause 7 (4) of the Electoral Bonds Scheme is the least restrictive means to balance the rights to informational privacy to political contributions and the right to information about political contributions,” the Court said.\nWhy was electoral bonds scheme struck down wholly?\nThe Court noted that the “anonymity of the contributor” is the only feature that set apart the electoral bonds scheme from other modes of contributions (cheques, debit, etc.). \nIf the anonymity component of the scheme is struck down, “the Electoral Bond Scheme 2018 will also consequentially have to be struck down as unconstitutional”, the Court explained.\nManifestly arbitrary to allow corporate donations unchecked\nThe Court pointed out corporate donors are not like individuals. Donations by companies to political parties are “purely business transactions, made with the intent of securing benefits in return.”\nThe Court also took critical note that the electoral bonds allowed even loss-making companies to make anonymous political donations. This ignored the fact that loss-making companies are more likely to make quid pro quo contributions, the Court said.\nThus, the Court concluded that the decision to allow corporate donors to make unlimited, anonymous political donations was manifestly arbitrary and violative of Article 14 (right to equality) of the Constitution.\n“The amendment to Section 182 (of Companies Act) by permitting unlimited corporate contributions authorizes unrestrained influence of companies on the electoral process. This is violative of the principle of free and fair elections and political equality captured in the value of ‘one person one vote,’” the Court added.\nPossible victimisation of donors not justification for electoral bonds scheme\nIn his opinion, Justice Sanjiv Khanna was not persuaded by the Central government’s contention that the electoral bonds scheme was also meant to protect political donors from retaliation from political parties in power due to the donors’ political affiliation to a rival party.\nTransparency and not secrecy is the cure and antidote, Justice Khanna said.\n“Giving a cloak of secrecy leads to severe restriction and curtailment of the collective’s right to information and the right to know, which is a check and counters cases of retribution, victimisation and retaliation,” the judge explained.\nThe judge added that political parties in power may still have asymmetric access to information about donors maintained in banks. Thus, the judge opined that the scheme was contradictory.\nConcerns were also briefly raised on the possibilities of enabling money laundering.\n“By ensuring anonymity, the policy ensures that the money laundered on account of quid pro quo or illegal connection escapes eyeballs of the public,” the judge said."}
{"ID": "id_1394", "Summary": "The Allahabad High Court on May 31 confirmed a Varanasi court order that had deemed maintainable a suit filed by Hindu parties seeking rights of worship inside the Gyanvapi Mosque [Committee of Management, Anjuman Intezamia Masajid, Varanasi v Rakhi Singh].\nJustice JJ Munir held that the suit was not hit by Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act which seeks to protect the status of all religious structures as it stood on the date of independence by barring courts from entertaining cases which raise dispute over the character of such places of worship.\nThe High Court reasoned that if the Hindu parties in the case or devotees like them can worship in the premises of the Gyanvapi Mosque once a year, then doing so daily may not change the Mosque's character. \n\"This Court fails to see that if the plaintiffs or devotees like them can do pooja and darshan of the deities on a single day in the year with no threat to the mosque's character, how the making of it a daily or a weekly affair, would lead to a conversion or change of the mosque's character,\" the judgment stated. \nThis was after the Court noted that the Hindu parties were doing darshan and pooja of Goddess Maa Sringar Gauri, Lord Ganesha, Lord Hanuman and the other Deities in the suit property throughout the year up until the year 1990 and once a year after 1993.\nFurther, the judge said that merely asking to enforce a right to worship Maa Sringar Gauri, Lord Ganesha, Lord Hanuman and other deities located in the suit property was not an act that would change the character of the Gyanvapi Mosque into a temple.\n\"The mere asking to enforce a right to worship Maa Sringar Gauri, Lord Ganesha, Lord Hanuman and the other Deities, located in the suit property at their specified place, is not an act that changes the character of the Gyanvapi Mosque into a temple. It is no more than the seeking of a full enforcement of a subsisting right that inheres in the plaintiffs and since long exercised by other devotees like them until a time much after 15th August, 1947,\" the Court said.\nThe Court made these observations while refusing to entertain a revision petition filed by Committee of Management of Anjuman Intezamia Masjid against a district court order which had held that the suit was maintainable.\nOn September 12 2022, District Judge Dr AK Vishvesha had dismissed the plea filed by the Muslim party contesting the maintainability of the suit.\nThe revisionists (Muslim parties) had argued that the plaint ought to be rejected without a trial of the suit because the suit was barred by the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, which requires the religious character of a place of worship as on August 15, 1947 to continue as it is.\nThe Muslim parties claimed that the structure was a mosque as on August 15 and should continue as such.\nThe Hindu parties, however, claimed that given the existence of the idols since time immemorial in the precincts of the suit property, the provisions of the Act would not bar the suit.\nIt was also argued that if a person forcibly and without authority of law offers namaz within that property or at a particular place, it cannot be called a mosque.\nPertinently, it was argued that they have been offering pooja and doing darshan at the premises regularly up until 1990 and once a year after 1993. \nThe Court, on considering these arguments, held that the suit is confined to the enforcement of the plaintiffs' right to worship according to established tradition.\nIt was further recorded that this right was exercised by the devotees all through the year up to the year 1990 without hitch. Thereafter, it ran a troubled course between the years 1990 and 1993, after which it was restricted to a single day on the fourth day of the Vasantik Navratra in Chaitra.\nKeeping this in view, Justice Munir found that what the plaintiffs simply sought to enforce a subsisting right of worship which they had been exercising after August 15, 1947. \n\"It is not that the plaintiffs, in any manner, wish to bring about any change to the suit property or alter its character, in whatever manner existing.\"\nWith this, the judge refused to interfere with the Varanasi court's order. \n\"The learned District Judge has, more or less for the same reasons, held that the suit is not barred by the Act of 1991 and this Court, for all that has been said, does not find any ground to interfere with that conclusion.\"\nSenior Advocate Syed Ahmed Faizan and Advocate Zaheer Asghar appeared for the Muslim parties. \nThe Hindu parties were represented by Advocates Prabhash Pandey, Arya Suman Pandey, Saurabh Tiwari, Vishnu Shankar Jain and Vineet Sankalp."}
{"ID": "id_1395", "Summary": "The Supreme Court on Tuesday took a dim view of the conduct of both the Governor and the Chief Minister of Punjab in connection with the recent controversy surrounding Governor's refusal to summon the budget session of the Punjab Legislative Assembly.\nReferring to the war of words between Governor Banwarilal Purohit and Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann, the Court said that while it is cognizant of the right to free speech and expression, Constitutional discourse has to be conducted with a sense of decorum and mature statesmanship.\n\"Political differences in a democratic polity is acceptable and has to be worked out with a sense of propriety and maturity without having to race to the bottom. Unless these features are adhered to, Constitutional principles will be put to jeopardy,\" the Court said.\nA bench of Chief Justice of India (CJI) DY Chandrachud and Justice PS Narasimha was hearing a plea filed by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government in Punjab after the Governor refused to summon the budget session of the State legislature, which was slated to begin on March 3.\nThe Court found that there was no occasion for the Governor to seek legal advice on whether to summon the budget session and he is bound by the advice of the council of ministers in this regard.\nFurther, it noted that the tone and tenor of the Chief Minister's letter and tweet, which had eventually prompted the Governor to refuse summoning the budget session, \"left much to be desired.\"\nThe bench comprising Chief justice DY Chandrachud and Justice PS Narasimha expressed hope that mature Constitutional statesmanship will not lead to more such situations and that the functionaries are aware of the public trust entrusted to them to sub-serve citizens. \n\"We note that failure of Constitutional authority to fulfil its duty would not be a justification for another to fulfill his distinct duty under Constitution\", the Court added.\nGovernor Banwarilal Purohit had earlier, in a letter dated February 23, intimated that he would not be summoning the Budget session until he obtained legal advice on \"derogatory\" and \"patently unconstitutional\" remarks made by Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann in a February 14 letter. \nChief Minister Mann, meanwhile, had questioned the basis on which the Governor had held his post in his February 14 letter. Prior to this, the Chief Minister had tweeted that he was only accountable to 3 crore Punjabis who elected him and not the Governor. \nThe tweet was triggered after the Governor questioned the Chief Minister on several decisions taken by the AAP government in Punjab. As per reports, discontentment between the two functionaries has been brewing over such issues for months. \nCriticising both of them for their conduct, the Supreme Court remarked,\n\"There was no occasion [for the Governor] to seek legal advise on whether to convene the Budget Session as he was bound by the aid and advice of Council of Ministers. \nThe Governor has the right to seek information from the Chief Minister on the decisions taken and once such information is sought, the Chief Minister is duty-bound to furnish it. The tone and tenor of the letter by the Chief Minister and the tweet by the Chief Minister leaves much to be desired.\"\nThe Court reiterated that the Governor has been entrusted to guide and counsel the government. \nFurther, the Court observed that there is no scope for discretion when it comes to the Governor's function to act on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers. \n“The Governor appointed by the President is entrusted to guide and counsel. In terms of Constitutional jurisprudence, the decision of a 7-judge constitution Bench in Shamsher Singh v. State of Punjab has clearly laid down that the Governor is the Constitutional head of State and acts on aid and advice of Council of Ministers. In view of clear Constitutional position ... the authority entrusted to the Governor is to be exercised in aid and advise of the council of ministers. This is not an area where the Governor exercises his Constitutional discretion,” the Court made it clear.\nThe matter was heard this evening after it was urgently mentioned earlier in the day by Senior Advocate AM Singhvi. \nThe matter was disposed of after the Court was informed by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta that Governor Banwarilal Purohit has now summoned the Budget Session of the State Legislative Assembly for March 3 at 10 AM."}

Further, the allegations of rape and molestation was also supported by her daughter.\nIn August 2021, the complainant and the accused got married according to Hindu rites and therefore, she moved an application before the special judge stating that she does not want to pursue the prosecution and that the case should be disposed of on the basis of the compromise.\nThe accused then moved the High Court for quashing of the case.\nThe counsel for the accused said that if the case proceeds then no useful purpose would be served and the same would be an abuse of process of Court.

The same was done to avoid audit by the CAG, the Bench has stated.\nThe LIFE Mission, Kerala government’s flagship housing project, ran into trouble after Anil Akkara, MLA for Wadakkanchery in Thrissur district filed a complaint stating that the LIFE Mission Project violated Foreign Currency Regulation Act (FCRA) norms. His specific complaint was against the project at his constituency at Wadakkanchery.\nFor the project, the State government had agreed to allot land to building contractors chosen by the donors. The project at Wadakkanchery was funded by the UAE consulate’s Red Crescent. Akkara claimed that the Kerala government obtained funds for Unitac builders (which was chosen as contractor) from Red Crescent, thereby, violating the FCRA.\nThe CBI proceeded to file an FIR pursuant to the complaint, naming Unitac’s Santhosh Eappen, Sane Ventures (another contractor), and “unnamed officials of the LIFE Mission project”.\nThere were charges that the LIFE Mission project was awarded to Eappen and Sane venture at the behest of former UAE Consulate employee and gold smuggling accused Swapna Suresh working with former Principal Secretary to the Kerala Chief Minister’s Office, M Sivasankar.\nShortly after the CBI’s FIR, the LIFE Mission CEO approached the Kerala High Court seeking quashing of the investigation. Close on the heels of the LIFE Mission plea, Eappen also filed a writ petition praying that the investigation against him and his company be quashed.\nIn October, the Kerala High Court admitted the case and granted a two-month interim stay on investigation in respect of the LIFE mission.

We trust, therefore, that the media will take note of these observations and adopt a code of responsible journalistic conduct that will inform news reporting in the days to come\" the bench said in its judgment.\nIt, therefore, urged media to adopt a code of responsible journalistic conduct while reporting the news.\nThe division bench's observations came on an appeal moved by one, Priya Varghese against the order of a single-judge that had directed the Kannur University to re-examine her credentials to be appointed as an Associate Professor.\nThe case had garnered much media attention as Varghese is married to KK Ragesh, who is the private secretary to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan. \nIn November last year, a single-judge had held that Varghese does not have the requisite teaching experience to be appointed to the post. That judgment was passed on a petition moved by Dr. Joseph Skariah, who was ranked after Varghese in the rank list of candidates for the post.\nSubsequently, Varghese moved the present appeal challenging the order.\nThe division bench, citing the provisions of the UGC Regulations of 2018, held that the period spent by Varghese in pursuing her PhD under the faculty development program could not be excluded while estimating her teaching experience. \nThe bench further held that the period spent by Varghese on deputation as the Director of Student Services/Programme Coordinator of the National Service Scheme of Kannur University would count towards her teaching experience as well.\n\"In our view, the answer to the question as to whether or not the experience gained by a teacher, while on deputation to a non-teaching post, qualifies as teaching experience must depend upon the nature of activities undertaken by the teacher in the post to which she is deputed and not merely by the classification – as teaching or non-teaching – accorded to the post,\" the Court stated.\nConsequently, the bench set aside the order of the single-judge and directed that her candidature for the post of Associate Professor be considered accordingly.\nBefore concluding the judgment, however, the bench deemed it necessary to make a few observations about the media attention that the case received while it was being adjudicated before the single-judge.\n\"Frighteningly frequent are those occasions when the impugned decision in academic matters attracts media attention for some reason or the other, and the court has then to deal with the added distraction brought about through incessant newspaper/channel discussions and overwhelming social media posts,\" the bench said. \nPointing out that it not only harms the adjudication process but the rights of the litigants as well, the bench called for the media to be more responsible while covering the proceedings in such cases. \nSenior Advocate Renjith Thampan, instructed by advocate Arun Kumar, appeared on behalf of Varghese. \nSenior Advocate George Poonthottam and advocate Santharam P appeared for Dr. Skariah. \nSenior Advocate P Ravindran and advocate IV Pramod appeared for the University registrar. \nSenior Advocate S Gopakumaran Nair appeared for the Chancellor of Universities in Kerala.\nSenior Government Pleader TB Hood appeared for the State and advocate S Krishnamoorthy appeared for the University Grants Commission."}
{"ID": "id_1407", "Summary": "The Bombay High Court today rejected the public interest litigation seeking relaxation of the 75% score in higher secondary examination which is the eligibility criterion for admission to IITs.\nA division bench of Acting Chief Justice SV Gangapurwala and Justice Sandeep Marne observed that it cannot intervene at this stage and it was for the government authorities to consider and take a decision.\n\"The students, whose cause petitioner is arguing, neither have any vested right nor legitimate expectation to claim relaxation in the eligibility criteria for admissions during the current year. Since grant of relaxation is a policy decision, the same can be taken by the government in appropriate circumstances.

This would be another reason why this court would be loathe in interfering in the methodology of conducting JEE and / or admission process\", the bench reasoned. \nThe PIL highlighted that until last year the eligibility criteria of 75% was not applicable.\nWith this sudden change in eligibility, lakhs of students may be affected, it was submitted.\nPetitioner Anubha Sahai appearing in person argued that the condition had been relaxed since 2021 and the same relaxation could be given to the students of the present academic year. \nShe also contended that the education boards in the State had not declared the top 20 percentile which was also a criteria for admissions.\nOn April 6, the Court asked the National Testing Agency (NTA) to file its response to the applications and inform why the qualification criterion of securing 75% marks in board exam was prescribed despite there being a qualifying examination. \nNTA claimed that its decision of keeping 75% cut off percentage was conscious and well considered decision taken with the approval of JEE Apex Board (JAB). The relaxation of the criterion for previous academic years was a one time measure.\nDuring the hearing yesterday, Additional Solicitor General Anil Singh for the National Testing Agency (NTA) informed the Court that the policy of 75% criteria was applicable since 2017. \nHe apprised the court that this system was relaxed for academic years 2020-21, 2021-22 and 2022-23 althought it was only a one time relaxation and temporary in nature. \n\"It is not that we are implementing or re-implementing. This condition was kept in abeyance, and it has been revived. All students were aware of facts of conditions in brochures. There cannot be a legitimate expectation or hope, you have to have right. Just because there was relaxation once, there cannot be an expectation that it would be happen again\" Singh argued."}

However, the Court said added that such officials may not be summoned if any issues cropping up can be sorted by way of affidavits from the officials. \nThe Court also directed that an official cannot be summoned only because his or her view is different from the view of the court.\nHowever, the Court clarified that the personal presence of officials may be required if there is suppression of facts. \nIn respect of the comments made on the attire of officials, the top court specifically emphasised the courts must refrain from doing so \"unless there is violation of dress code of their own office.\"\nIt added that government officers should not be made to stand during the entire proceedings unless needed or asked to. \n\"Court must refrain from making remarks or observations to humiliate such officers,\" said the Court further.\nFor the future, the Supreme Court ordered that advance notice must be given before summoning the officials for adequate preparation. \nThe first option for such appearance must be through video conference, the top court added.\nThe Court issued the guidelines while disposing of a plea filed by the Uttar Pradesh government against the orders passed by Allahabad High Court last year to summon two senior government officers. \nThe High Court in one of the orders had also ordered the arrest of two senior IAS officers although they were released a day later after the Supreme Court's intervention. \nWhile setting aside the High Court's orders, the Supreme Court today opined that frequently summoning government officials runs contrary to the scheme envisaged by the Constitution.\nIt made it clear that the High Court, which was hearing a plea concerning retiral benefits of judges, cannot browbeat the executive or take over its rule-making functions by judicial fiat of contempt proceedings.\n\"Compelling the State Government to mandatorily notify the Rules by the next date of hearing, in the First Impugned Order, virtually amounted to the High Court issuing a writ of mandamus to notify the Rules proposed by the Chief Justice.

{"ID": "id_1414", "Summary": "The Delhi High Court recently granted anticipatory bail to a 20-year-old student accused of raping his 35-year-old professor on false pretext of marriage. \nSingle-judge Justice Saurabh Banerjee observed that the prosecutrix (professor) was a mature woman of around 35 years who had a relationship with the accused when he was a young boy of about 20 years. \nShe was previously married and going through a divorce, the Court further noted, before granting pre-arrest bail to the accused student.\n\"Prima facie, it seems that she was in a relationship with the applicant (accused) out of choice and desire rather out of compulsion or force. More so, whence she out of her own sweet will voluntarily chose to proceed with the applicant with open eyes, open ears and an open mind,\" the Court held.\nAccording to the first information report (FIR), the woman had met the accused in February 2022 at the college where he was a student. \nThe woman claimed that in May 2022, while she was on a work trip to Manali, they had a small wedding ceremony at a temple where the boy promised to have a legal marriage with her at some point in the future.\nThe woman further claimed that on June 4, 2022, she met the student's family at his home and that they had no objections to their marriage.\nAccording to the FIR, after learning about the woman's pregnancy in April 2023, the accused and his family pressured her to have an abortion, which he facilitated with a pill.\nIn June 2023, the woman discovered she was pregnant again and on July 1, 2023 but the accused took ₹2,50,000 from her and left. The next day he scheduled an appointment for the prosecutrix with a gynecologist in Gurgaon on July 4, 2023, which was their last interaction.\nThe counsel for the accused argued that he had no intention to harm or threaten the prosecutrix. \nHe contended that the prosecutrix has shown her intent to intimidate the accused and his family on multiple occasions. Further, he argued that the FIR was filed solely to harass the accused who is a 20-year-old student at the college where the prosecutrix worked as a professor.\nOn the other hand, the counsel for State opposed the bail plea in light of the heinousness of the alleged offences.\nThe Court noted that while dealing with rape cases, it must recognize the severity of the crime and the corresponding punishment. \nHowever, it must also carefully consider the specific details, circumstances, background and whereabouts relevant to the case in addition to the overall context, the Court added.\nThe prosecutrix was admittedly having a ‘guru-shishya’ relation with the applicant and that she was well aware of the repercussions of entering into a relationship with a student who was not old enough to marry, the Court said.\n\"It would not be wrong for this Court to conclude at this stage that the prosecutrix was/ is someone who is having more than average intelligence and who was/ is well aware of the rights of a married woman and that the applicant had not reached marital age yet. It would also not be wrong for this Court to infer that she was/ is well aware of the repercussions of entering into a relation with such an underage individual ‘Student’,\" the Court remarked.\nThe Court proceeded to arrive at a prima facie opinion that the prosecutrix had willingly entered and sustained a relationship with the accused for over a year.\nThe Court also rejected an argument that the accused was a \"proclaimed offender\" and, therefore, not entitled to maintain a plea for bail. The Court pointed out that he was only a \"proclaimed person\" who was avoiding arrest under Section 82 (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) and that he had not been declared a \"Proclaimed Offender\" under Section 82 (4) of the CrPC.\nThe Court concluded that the student had made out a prima facie case for the grant of bail. \n\"Even otherwise, this Court is not required to critically analyze the evidence on record at the stage of considering grant of anticipatory bail to the applicant,\" the single-judge said.\nThus, the Court allowed the anticipatory bail application with certain conditions including the furnishing of a personal bond of ₹1,00,000 along with one surety of a like amount.\nSenior Advocate Pramod Kumar Dubey along with advocates Abhik Chimni, Pallavi Garg, Anant Khajuri, Saharsh, Satyam Sharma, Aditi, Akshat Sharma and Riya Pahuja appeared for the accused.\nAPP Meenakshi Dahiya appeared for State.\nAdvocates Vikram Singh Jakhar, Mohit Yadav, Varnika Sharma and Saurabh Sharma appeared for prosecutrix."}

By the end of the scheme, investors would get a gold coin, the couple was told. The couple accordingly invested ₹10,000 per month till May 2014, when they were informed by Gitanjali Gems that it had terminated the franchisee agreement with Divyanirman Jewels. \nThe couple then offered to pay the remaining three instalments and asked for their gold coin promised by the scheme, only to be informed that there were no gold coins. Therefore, they demanded their deposited money back, but no such amount was paid despite several calls and emails to the Gitanjali Group.\nOn April 3, 2017, the couple filed a complaint against the owner of Divyanirman Jewels (Digvijaysinh Jadeja), Mehul Choksi and two other directors of Gitanjali Gems.\nIn an order passed on October 11, the High court dismissed a plea to quash this criminal case on finding that a prima facie case had been made out against the accused. \nIt is clear that the investors in the gold scheme were cheated, the High Court remarked, adding that the investigation in the matter should continue. \n\"Prima facie, it is found that after giving false promises through their franchisee, such showrooms are closed down and the customers who have invested their money are cheated. It is found that the showrooms of the company in the respective cities are closed down.\"\nThe Court also noted that these incidents were reported in all places where Gitanjali Gems had a franchisee.\n\"Due to such fraudulent act and closure of the showrooms, money invested by the investors is not refunded and it can be said that a huge scam is committed. Therefore, the ultimate liability can be fastened on the shoulders of the persons responsible for the affairs of Gitanjali Gems and present petitioners being the Directors and actively involved in the management of the company cannot shirk their responsibility,\" the Court added.\nAdvocate Salil M Thakore appeared for Choksi and directors of Gitanjali Gems.\nAdvocate Param R Buch represented the complainant.\nAdditional Public Prosecutor Chintan Dave represented the State government."}

He said that the act was not intended to scandalise the Court or its authority.\nHowever, the Court was not convinced by this defence put forth by the respondent.\n“It is like one saying “I did not see the policeman on the other side of the road when I jumped the traffic signal; had I seen him, I would not have done so,” the Bench said.\nIt was stated that he had consciously elected to come into the Court proceedings virtually and on having done so, he was required to maintain a sense of respect and decorum irrespective of whether the camera was on or off.\nIt was the Bench’s stand that if he had engaged in the act on exiting the virtual platform, no one would have had any grievance.\n“The whole problem for him was he wanted to have the best of the worlds at the same time, viz., to be in virtual hearing platform with his professional work and simultaneously, to canoodle with “X”.”\nTherefore, saying that one cannot run with the hare and hunt with the hound, his explanation was dismissed.\nThe Court also clarified that “X” was not impleaded in the contempt petition as she was from a poor background and a victim of circumstances.\n“She fell prey to Santhana Krishnan's lechery,” the Court remarked.\nThough the Court took into account that “X” appeared to be an accomplice in the video, they found her plight disturbing since she not only suffered, but would continue to suffer shame and trauma on account of the respondent’s indiscretion.\nIn terms of sentence, the respondent prayed for mercy on the grounds that he had suffered enough and not only had he lost his name and honour in society, but he also suffered incarceration for 34 days and suspension of practice.\nThe Court while contemplating his appeal referred to verses 2 to 11 of Chapter 8 titled “John” of the Holy Bible, and said that there may be many like the respondent who were lucky or clever enough to not be captured and the Court could not engage in moral policing.\n“Though we are too small to play Jesus, yet, one cannot be oblivious of the fact that there could be many a Santhana Krishnan in various walks of life who are lucky enough in not getting captured in a camera or clever enough to get away by hook or crook,” the order said.\nThus, it was their decision to temper justice with mercy and not flog him to assert their might.\n“The power of the ocean does not lie in its tumultuous tides but in its meditative vastness.”\nWith this, the respondent was sentenced to undergo simple imprisonment for two weeks for each charge and pay a fine of ₹6,000 in total.\nAdvocate B Vijay appeared for the petitioner while the respondent was represented by advocate K Elangovan."}
{"ID": "id_1423", "Summary": "The Punjab and Haryana High Court recently said that the Enforcement Directorate (ED) cannot confine a person within a premises during its search and seizure operation in a money laundering case [Dilbag Singh @ Dilbagh Sandhu v Union of India and another].\nJustice Vikas Bahl made the observation while setting aside the arrest of former Indian National Lok Dal legislator Dilbagh Singh and another accused Kulwinder Singh in a money laundering case related to allegations of illegal mining.\n“There is nothing which stops the persons whose premises are being searched from carrying out their daily routine including going to their offices/place of work,” the Court observed.\nThe Court added that while ED officers have a right to require the persons to open any lock, safe, almirah and break open the items in case of non-compliance, they do not “have a right to restrain the movements of the said persons i.e. the petitioners in the present case within the premises.” \nDilbagh Singh and Kulwinder Singh - the petitioners, had challenged their arrest and the orders remanding them to the ED custody in the case under Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).\nOne of the allegations was that the petitioners along with their family members were illegally detained by the ED from January 4 to January 8 when the search and seizure at their houses took place. They were illegally shown to have been arrested on January 8, the Court was told.\nThe Court considered whether the detention was illegal, and found it proven from the record that the petitioners were not permitted to leave their house during the time of search. \nThe ED had relied upon its rules on search and seizure to contend that presence of the petitioners and other persons was essential as they were in possession of the locker, safe, almirah, documents and other material.\nHowever, the Court examined the rules and found that while the rules given an occupant of a building an enabling right to attend or be present during the search, that does not translate to ED having a right to demand their presence during such search.\n“Reading of the said provision would show that the occupant of the building cannot be forced to attend the search much less to stay confined in the premises for days altogether till the time the search is concluded,” it added.\nIt also reasoned that the ED already has the power to break open the lock of a locker, safe or almirah in case its request for keys is not complied with.\nThe Court also examined Section 18 of the PMLA (provision enabling personal search by ED) and concluded that the authority cannot detain the person so searched for more than 24 hours prior to taking him before the Gazetted Officer or to the Magistrate.\nIn the present case, the Court found that the ED had not invoked Section 18 and thus could not have detained or restrained the petitioners. \nThus, the Court said the petitioners would be deemed to have been arrested on January 4. It rejected the argument that the petitioners were in the premises out of their own will.\nJustice Bahl also found that the Special Court under PMLA, while remanding the accused to custody, had not applied its mind to see whether there was compliance with Section 19 of the PMLA in the arrest of the two petitioners.\nThe Court further found there was no full compliance of Section 19 of the Act by the ED. \nIt thus set aside the arrest order, arrest memos along with the orders of remand on following grounds, \nConsidering the findings,  the Court allowed the petitions and ordered immediate release of the petitioners. \nSenior Advocate Chetan Mittal and advocates Anshul Mangla, Udit Garg, Himanshu Gupta, Vinay Arya and Ritvik Garg represented the petitioner\nSpecial Counsel Zoheb Hossain, Deputy Solicitor General Jagjyot Singh Lalli, Senior Panel Counsel Lokesh Narang, Special Public Prosecutor Simon Benjamin and Advocates Manish Verma, Vivek, Kartik Sabharwal and Abhipriya Raj represented the ED."}

Dainik Bhaskar & Anr and connected petitions].\nConsequently, the Court concluded that a complaint by a working journalist under the MRTU Act was not maintainable before an industrial court.\nA division bench of Justices Nitin Jamdar and Sandeep Marne observed that working journalists constitute a distinct class with unique privileges under the Working Journalists Act, and the rules framed thereunder.\n“Working journalists constitute a distinct class with unique privileges and protections in their employment. This recognition of special status, distinct from other workmen, has been upheld based on the premise that working journalists form a separate category,\" the Court observed in its February 29 judgment.\nThe Court proceeded to clarify that working journalists would not, therefore, fall under the category of \"employee\" or \"workman\" under the MRTU Act. \nRather, the Court explained that disputes concerning working journalists can be settled by opting for the mechanisms laid down in the Industrial Disputes Act. \nThe judgment was passed on a reference to the division bench by a single judge, who had found that there were conflicting judgments on whether journalists could be considered employees or workmen under the MRTU Act.\nThe questions arose on petitions concerning journalists, Devendra Pratap Singh (working in Pioneer Book newspaper establishment) and Indrakumar Jain  (journalist in Dainik Bhaskar) and the management of Dainik Bhaskar.\nThe petitions were filed before the High Court after industrial courts rejected complaints filed by the working journalists on the ground that working journalists did not fall within the term of \"employee\" or \"workman\" under the MRTU Act.\nThe newspaper management argued that the reference by the single judge to a division bench was not required as there was no conflict in decisions.\nThe division bench agreed with the submission and held that there was a conclusive decision on the issue in August 2015 by the Bombay High Court in the case of Shashikaran Shrivastava v. Bennet Coleman. However, it proceeded to decide the question of law as dealt with in the 2015 judgment.\nThe Court observed that once the working journalists are placed in a different class, they cannot make grievances regarding the same.\n“By advancing various technical arguments, what the Journalist are attempting to do is to acquire rights available to other workmen on the basis they are similarly situated, without relinquishing their special privilege, which are not available to other workmen. The scheme of the governing legislations do not permit the same,” the Court said, in the judgment uploaded on March 4.\nThe Court went on to hold that complaints filed by working journalists under the MRTU Act would not be maintainable because they enjoy being of special class, and are not employees for the purposes of the said Act.\n“The status of working journalists remains distinct from that of regular workmen due to the retention of their special privileges. The contention of working journalists seeking to assert themselves as employees, thereby enabling them to file complaints of unfair labor practices and avail of collective bargaining, aims at expanding their rights while preserving their special privileges. However, this course of action will contradict the combined reading of the governing statutes,\" the Court observed.\nSenior advocate Sanjay Singhvi with advocates Bannet D’Costa and Jignasha Pandya appeared for Indrakumar Jain, a journalist.\nAdvocates Anand R Pai, Pratik Kothari and Avinash Patil appeared for Dainik Bhaskar.\nAdvocates Vijay Vaidya, Mahendra Agvekar and Shraddha Chavan appeared for Pioneer Book Co.\nAdvocates Jane Cox and Karishma Rao appeared for the journalist, Devendra Pratap Singh."}

On the other hand, the petitioner emphasised that since the girl child was less that 5 years of age, her custody ordinarily lay with the mother.\nThe Court agreed with this submission while stating that the child’s welfare was the paramount consideration and the same ought to be considered on the acknowledged superiority of a mother's love and affection for her children.\nFurther, Justice Bedi was of the opinion that the child may have refused to leave with the petitioner since she had left her company and spent over two years with the grandparents.\n“Even if the statement of the father is taken as the truth that the child had refused to go with the mother, that by itself does not have any significance as a child of such tender age does not know what is in her best interest,” the Court stated.\nTherefore, in the child’s interest for the long-term, it could not be said that she would be better taken care of by the grandparents.\n“In fact nothing significant has been pointed out by the respondent nos.7 & 8 as to why the custody of the child ought not to be with the mother,” the Court underlined.\nThe single-judge also said that the idea of shared custody was illogical and unreasonable since the petitioner lived in Australia, and respondents in India.\nWith this, it was directed that the child’s custody be handed over to the mother immediately.

Wilson had further said that Stalin had merely called for eradication of some problematic principles of the Sanatana dharma, particularly the ‘Varnashrama dharma’ that pertains to duties performed according to the system of the four varnas or class and caste-based division.\nThe Court had then asked Stalin what was the basis of his comments and whether he had done any research on Varnashrama and Sanatan Dharma before making such comments.\nIn its order today, the Court said that in equating “Sanatan dharma to HIV, Dengue, and Malaria,” Stalin had acted against constitutional principles.\nWhile such conduct makes a politician liable to disqualification, the Court could not issue a writ of quo warranto as prayed for in the petition in the absence of any action taken against Stalin and the others, the Court said.\nIt, therefore, disposed of the petition.\n“Though there maybe ideological differences between leaders of different political parties, any statements made should be constructive and not destructive of nay faith,” the Court underscored."}

They were meant to arrive at Jammu at 8:10 AM and were set to take a flight from Jammu to Srinagar at noon. However, the train was delayed by four hours and reached Jammu at noon, causing the complainant to miss the connecting flight.\nFollowing this, the complainant approached the District Forum which granted him compensation, observing that there was a deficiency in service and because of that the complainant suffered. Both the State Commission and the National Commission confirmed this order, prompting the Railways to approach the Supreme Court.\nArguing before the apex court, Additional Solicitor General Aishwarya Bhatti vehemently argued that late running of a train cannot be said to be deficiency in service on the part of the Railways and that there was no liability on the part of the Railways to pay compensation for the same. It was also submitted that there may be number of reasons for delay of trains.\nHowever, the Bench found that since no evidence was led by the Railways explaining the delay of the train, it was not proved that the delay occurred due to reasons beyond their control. Therefore, unless the same was established, the Railways was liable to pay compensation for delay and late arrival of trains, the Court held."}

Lucknow to introduce biometric system in the office of Chief Standing Counsel, Allahabad within two weeks and he shall ensure that files of each and every matter listed in the Court reaches by 10.00 AM, when the Courts sits and start their judicial work,\" the Court ordered.\nThe direction was passed after a counsel appearing for State in a case sought adjournment on the ground the case file had not come from CSC's office.\nThe Court noted that Chief Standing Counsel, KR Singh, who was present in the Court earlier, had assured the Court that all the files will reach the Court on time and there was no need of a biometric system for attendance of the employees. \nHowever, despite the assurance of CSC, the files were yet to reach the Court, the judge noted.\n\"It is 11.10 AM and most of the files from the office of Chief Standing Counsel had not come.

{"ID": "id_1435", "Summary": "The Delhi High Court recently held that private schools must implement the recommendations of the sixth and seventh Central Pay Commissions (CPC) and pay their teaching and non-teaching employees the mandated salary and other benefits [Anjali Vaid and Ors v Adarsh World School and Ors + Connected matters].\nJustice Chandra Dhari Singh observed that employees of the private schools have a vested right to be paid the salaries and emoluments as per the recommendations of the pay commissions, and schools cannot cite lack of funds to deny these benefits to their staff.\nNo school can seek waiver of the recommendations by citing any reason whatsoever, Justice Singh underscored.\n“Moreover, if the schools are granted waiver from implementation of the recommendations of the pay commission, then the same would result in the schools’ employee salary be given as per the whims and fancies of the school. They may also force the staff to work at lesser pay than the pay as stipulated by Section 10 of DSE [Delhi School Education Act, 1973] which states that the salary as well as the other allowances of the employees of recognized school should not be less than that of the employees of the corresponding status in schools run by the appropriate authority,” the Court observed. \nJustice Singh made it clear that even the unaided minority schools must pay the salaries and other benefits to their employees as per the recommendations of the pay commissions.\n“This Court is of the view that the unaided minority schools are bound by the Section 10 of DSE and hence, the staff of the unaided minority school is entitled to salary and emoluments at par with the salary and emoluments as payable to the employee at the same position of the school owned by the competent authority.”\nTherefore, the Court directed the Delhi government to constitute high powered committees (HPC) to supervise the implementation of the recommendations and guidelines prescribed by the sixth and the seventh pay commissions.\nThe HPC will be constituted at the State and the central levels. The central committee will be headed by the Delhi's Education Secretary and will also have one representative of the schools among its members.\nZonal committee will be headed by Zonal Education Officer and will deal with the issue of fee hike, salaries, and other benefits. This committee will recommend its findings to the Central committee.\n“[Central committee] after receiving the recommendations of the Zonal level Committee shall decide the issue recommended to it, expeditiously, preferably within six weeks from the date of receiving the said recommendation,” the Court said.\nThe Delhi government was directed to issue a notification within two weeks for convening zonal committees so that various stakeholders including teaching and non-teaching staff of several schools, who are aggrieved by the non-implementation of the pay commission, shall file their claims.\nThe Court passed the detailed order while dealing with a batch of petitions filed by teaching and non-teaching staff of various private schools in the national capital. They sought benefits of the sixth and seventh pay commissions and payments of their arrears as well as other benefits with interest.\nWhile the schools accepted that the petitioners are entitled to the salary and emoluments as per the recommendation of the pay commissions, they said they cannot afford to pay because of the lack of funds.\nIt was argued that the proposal for enhancement of the fees was sent by the schools to the Department of Education (DoE) but the same was rejected. They further argued that until the schools are permitted to hike the fee, the issue of payment of revised salary to the petitioners does not arise.\nHowever, the Court rejected the arguments and held that the non-compliance with the notification issued by the DoE for implementation of recommendations of the pay commission violates the petitioners’ rights enshrined under the Constitution of India."}

That also cannot be termed as cruelty sufficient enough to dissolve a legal marriage.\"\nThe parties were married on May 7, 2012 and were living as husband and wife in Abu Dhabi.\nThe husband contended that the wife insulted and ill-treated him in the presence of his relatives.

You are concerned about the past, and dig it up to place its burden on present generation. Each thing you do in this manner will create more disharmony,\" the bench said.\nThe Court said that the petitioner is reexamining the past selectively and also took objection to terming an entire community as barbaric.\n\"You are relooking at the past selectively. India is today a secular country. Your fingers being pointed at a particular community, termed barbaric. Do you want to keep the country under boil,\" Justice Joseph remarked.\nPertinently, the bench remarked that Hinduism is a great religion and it does not allow bigotry.\n\"Perhaps Hinduism is greatest religion in terms of metaphysics. Please do not belittle it. The world looks to us always. Even today. I can say, I am a Christian but am equally fond of Hinduism and have tried to study it. Try and understand its greatness. Do not use it for a particular purpose,\" Justice Joseph said.\n\"That is why it a way of life, does not allow bigotry,\" Justice Nagarathna weighed in.\n\"In fact, in Kerala where I come from, Hindus have donated land to churches,\" Justice Joseph said.\nJustice Nagarathna said that the country is facing so many other problems which should be first solved.\nShe also highlighted the divide and rule policy followed by the British to ensure that Indians kept fighting amongst themselves. \n\"Our country has so many problems to attend to ... Hinduism is a way of life, because of that India has assimilated everybody. Because of that we are able to live together. Divide and rule policy of British brought about schism in our society ...

Therefore, it was found that his remedy lay elsewhere.\n“The respondent's primary grievance appears to be that the petitioners not followed the rules and regulations of the party, not issued any show cause notice calling for explanation, failed to follow the principles of natural justice and expelled the respondent from the primary membership of the party without any valid reason, for this grievance his remedy and answer lies elsewhere and not by filing a defamation case,” the Court said.\nThe respondent argued before the Court that his expulsion was 'breaking news' in India and abroad due to which his “name and fame” had suffered.\nThe respondent also submitted that the baseless charges in the expulsion notice damaged the growth of his political career.\nIt was his stand that the petitioners could not blindly expel a member or office bearer from the party’s primary membership without affording them an opportunity to give an explanation on the allegations levelled.\nThe petitioners, on the other hand, informed the Court that Rule 35(xii) of the bye laws empowered them to take immediate disciplinary action to remove or suspend any primary member or office bearers of the party.\nIt was their submission that after the AIADMK party recently lost power, the conduct of the respondent had changed and he started acting against the party’s interests.\nThis caused damage to the name of the party, the petitioners said and therefore, they were left with no other alternative but to exercise their responsibilities as per the bye-laws and remove the respondent.\nFurther, they contended that a grievance in relation to removal could be agitated by the respondent in the manner known to law however, it could not be the subject matter of a criminal complaint for defamation.\nOn hearing both the parties, the Court examined previous expulsion letters issued by AIADMK in other cases and found that all of them were identical.\n“This Court finds that the wordings in the expulsion notice is a routine one which is verbatim repeated for years,” the Court said.\nFurther it was found that the petitioners being coordinator and joint coordinator had lawful authority to take disciplinary action against all members of the party.\nTherefore, the petitions were allowed and the case was quashed.\nSenior Advocates A Natarajan and Vijay Narayan along with advocates K Gowthamkuma and C Thirumaran appeared for the petitioners. \nThe respondent was represented by Advocates NGR Prasad and R Thirumoorthy."}

{"ID": "id_1444", "Summary": "The Bombay High Court on Friday directed the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation to grant permission to Uddhav Thackeray-led faction of the Shiv Sena to hold its annual Dussehra rally at Shivaji Park in Dadar, Mumbai this year. \nA bench of Justices RD Dhanuka and Kamal Khata quashed an order passed by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) refusing permission to hold the rally. \n\"This unjustified manner of taking decision, is certainly not a bona fide decision of the Municipal Corporation,\" the Court said.\nThe Court has granted permission to Shiv Sena to hold the rally at Shivaji Park between October 2 to 6, 2022. \nThe Court clarified that police was at liberty to record the entire event and in the event there was any untoward behaviour, the same can be a ground for refusing permission the next year. \nThe Bench observed that BMC could not explain why they did not consider the application between the period of August 22 and September 21, 2022. \n\"In our view, the impugned order passed by the Municipal Corporation clearly shows abuse of its power whilst rejecting the applications filed by the petitioners merely on the grounds that there was another application filed by the applicant and on that account there will be a law and order situation. ...We are satisfied that in this case, the Municipal Corporation has misused its powers by its decision of refusing the application for granting permission on a flimsy ground and that to, after a period of four weeks from the date of receipt of the application and close to the Dusshera festival.\" the order recorded. \nIn 2016, the BMC commissioner had been directed to allow holding of the Dussehra rally at Shivaji Park, and accordingly, permission was granted till 2019. The rally was not held in 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe plea pointed out that in 2022, as is procedure, the party applied to BMC on August 26, 2022 for permission to hold the rally on October 5, 2022, however, the same was not granted despite lapse of more than a month. This compelled the petitioner to approach High Court for appropriate directions.\nAfter the petition was filed before the High Court, the BMC took a decision rejecting the application. \nMeanwhile, the Eknath Shinde faction through MLA Sada Sarvankar filed an intervention application opposing the petition. \nWhen the matter was taken up for hearing on Friday, advocate Aspi Chinoy for Thackeray faction argued that Shiv Sena has been conducting its annual Dussehra Melawa (Rally) at the Shivaji Park since 1966.\nHe argued that Shiv Sena has a right to hold the Dussehra melawa (rally) as a matter of practice in the government resolution. \nChinoy contended that rejecting an application filed by Shiv Sena because there was another application filed by an individual MLA was perverse and irrational. \n\"If an individual's application creates a law and order situation then you preserve law and order. Any MLA wanting to hold at the same spot cannot be a ground for not allowing. Shiv Sena's right to hold the rally has been recognized by way of practice, since they have been holding it since 50 years, custom, tradition and also the resolution issued by the Maharashtra government in 2016 earmarking the ground to be used for Dussehra Melawa (rally),\" Chinoy stated.\nSenior Advocate Dr Milind Sathe for BMC said that the Thackeray faction has no right to hold such a rally.\nThe issue that could have been considered was whether the permission was granted in accordance with law or not. \n\"If a permission is rejected, it is a matter of injury. Where is the right?\" Sathe remarked. \nSathe emphasized that BMC had not acted arbitrarily by refusing permission to Shiv Sena and granting to others, they had refused permission to all because of law and order situation. \n\"The right is to assemble peacefully and lawfully and not to hold a rally. That right is not ascertained in the petition\" Sathe argued. \nSathe also pointed out the government resolution of 2016 which enlisted the 45 days when non-sporting events could be conducted on the Shivaji park playground. Sathe gave an example that a local school near Dadar had been granted permission to use the ground for their school function, and that had been specifically recorded in the petition. There was no such mention for Shiv Sena's rally. \n\"The GR grants permission was for Dussehra rally and not Shiv Sena's Dussehra rally\" Sathe said. \nSenior Advocate Janak Dwarkadas, appearing for MLA Sarvankar, sought a stay on the hearings of the matter till the issue of \"who represents the real Shiv Sena\" is resolved either by the Supreme Court or the Election Commission of India.\nSarvankar claimed that Thackeray's faction is misleading and misrepresenting facts before the Court as they do not belong to the real Shiv Sena political party.\n\"As on date, there exists a dispute on who represents the real Shiv Sena and the issue is pending before the Election Commission of India and also the Supreme Court,\" the intervention application filed by Sarvankar said.\nThe Court after hearing all parties rejected the intervention application by Sarvankar and allowed the Thackeray faction's petition."}
{"ID": "id_1445", "Summary": "A Constitution Bench of Supreme Court on Wednesday ruled that the group of companies doctrine will be applicable to arbitration proceedings in India [Cox and Kings vs SAP Pvt Ltd].\nThe \"group of companies\" doctrine states that a company that is a non-signatory to an arbitration agreement would be bound by the agreement if such a company is a member of the same group of companies that signed the agreement. The doctrine deems that the parties to the arbitration agreement mutually intended for such a non-signatory to be bound by it.\nA Constitution bench of Chief Justice of India (CJI) DY Chandrachud with Justices Hrishikesh Roy, PS Narasimha, JB Pardiwala, and Manoj Misra concluded that non-signatory parties, by virtue of their relationship with the signatory and engagement in commercial activities, cannot be deemed strangers to the dispute under arbitration.\n\"The non signatory by their relation to the signatory and performing commercial duties are not strangers to the dispute in comparison to signatory parties. The GoC (Group of Companies doctrine) is founded on mutual intent of parties ... The doctrine is used to bind the non signatory to the arbitration agreement so that it shares the profits and burden it entails,\" the Court said.\nThe verdict came in a case arising out of arbitration proceedings.\nThe following issues were considered by the bench.\n- Whether the group of companies doctrine should be read into Section 8 of the Arbitration Act or whether it can exist in Indian jurisprudence independent of any statutory provision?\n- Whether the group of companies doctrine should continue to be invoked on the basis of the principle of ‘single economic reality’?\n- Whether the group of companies doctrine should be construed as a means of interpreting the implied consent or intent to arbitrate between the parties?\n- Whether the principles of alter ego and/or piercing the corporate veil can alone justify pressing the group of companies doctrine into operation even in the absence of implied consent?\nThe Court emphasized that arbitration is a matter of contract and consent is paramount. No one can be compelled to submit to arbitration without their consent.\nIt said that courts have to determine whether a non-signatory to an arbitration agreement intended to create a legal relationship with the signatory and agreed to be bound by the arbitration agreement.\nReferring to Section 7A of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, the Court emphasized that while arbitration is contractual, it is not necessary for parties to be signatories to be bound by it.\nThe Court called for a balanced approach, emphasizing that the decision of parties not to include someone in the arbitration agreement should not be brushed aside. Simultaneously, the Court highlighted the importance of not excluding individuals who, through their conduct, have demonstrated an intention to be bound by the arbitration agreement.\nHowever, the Court also said that the doctrine, which was developed by international arbitration tribunals, is not sufficient to determine whether a party is bound by an agreement. As such, it called on courts to first establish the existence of a group of companies.\n\"Since GoC is consent based theory it is meant to ascertain the intention of both signatory and non signatory to be bound by the arbitration agreement,\" it said.\nThe Court concluded by upholding the doctrine's application to arbitration proceedings, stating that the definition of parties includes both signatory and non-signatory parties that are part of the same group of companies. \nHence, the Court held that the act of a non-signatory could make non-signatory companies that are part of the same group, a party to the contract. \nThe respondents, SAP India Private Limited and SAP SE GmbH, were represented by Senior Advocate Ritin Rai briefed by a team from JSA Advocates and Solicitors led by Partners Farhad Sorabjee, Dheeraj Nair, Pratik Pawar, Shanaya Cyrus Irani, and Kumar Kislay, and Senior Associates Siddhesh Pradhan and Aishna Jain."}

However, the school demanded another ₹11,000 towards uniform, study material including text books and stationary, etc. \nSince the petitioner was unable to pay the same, he was merely permitted to sit in class but was unable to study and learn since he could not afford any books and notebooks, his counsel told the Court. \nThe State government argued that it was required to pay for or reimburse only the tuition fees as fixed by the Fee Determination Committee.\nAny other fees has to be borne by the students admitted under the 25 percent quota, as provided for under Section 12(1)(c) of the Act. Therefore, the fee demanded for uniform, notebooks and study materials has to be paid by the petitioner and the State cannot be directed to pay the fees that are not determined by the Fee Determination Committee, the Tamil Nadu government argued. \nThe High Court however, held that the State's submission were erroneous and could not be accepted. \nIt said that books, uniforms, notebooks, and all other such material are necessary ingredients and integral to education. \nTherefore, the State has to reimburse the entire amount payable for all EWS students, including the petitioner, enrolled in schools across the State under provisions of the RTE Act.\nAdvocate R Sankarasubbu appeared for the petitioner. \nGovernment Advocate S Balamurugan appeared for the State Commission for Protection of Child Rights. \nAdditional Advocate General V Arun and advocate R Kumaravel appeared for the respondent State government and the District authorities. \nAdvocate R Natarajan appeared for the respondent School."}
{"ID": "id_1449", "Summary": "The traditional joint family system in India has been withering away and that is why a large number of old aged parents are not being looked after by their children, the Allahabad High Court recently observed [Krishna Kumar vs State of Uttar Pradesh].\nJustice Shree Prakash Singh made the observation while quashing a sub-divisional magistrate court's order evicting a son from his parents' house.\nIn a verdict passed on August 18, the Court noted that the objective of the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007 is to provide for more effective provisions for the maintenance and welfare of parents and senior citizens.\nThe Act is meant to provide a mechanism for the need-based maintenance to parents and senior citizens, including medical facilities for the protection of their life and property and to set up old age homes in every district, the bench said.\nThe bench added that nowadays, due to a steady rise in population, older persons in India are seen suffering on account of malnutrition and the unavailability of medicines and treatment. \nThe Court further remarked that traditional norms and values of Indian society emphasised on showing respect and caring for the aged members of the family who were normally cared for by the family itself.\n\"But, in the recent time, the society is witnessing a gradual definite withering of joint family system and therefore, a large number of parents are not being maintained by their children,\" the judge observed.\nThe Court opined that it is an established fact that the family is the most desired environment for senior citizens or aged parents to lead a life of security, care, and dignity.\n\"In this view of the fact and to ensure that the children should perform their moral obligation towards their parents, the Act, 2007 aims to create an enabling mechanism for the older persons ‘To Claim Need Based Maintenance From Their Children’,\" the judge added.\nIn the case at hand, a sub-divisional Magistrate had ordered eviction of the petitioner in 2019 from his parents' house on allegations that he often physically and mentally assaulted his old parents.\nOn the other hand, the petitioner contended that his family (father, mother and two sisters) were annoyed with him for marrying a woman from the Scheduled Caste (SC) category, and therefore, they wanted to oust him from his house. He alleged that his sisters were forcing his parents to sell the house in question.\nThe bench noted that the petitioner was living on one side of the house with his wife and children and that he also possessed a shop within the house, which was his source of income.\nTaking note of this, the bench opined that there is a need to re-examine whether the petitioner was actually avoiding taking care of his parents. \n\"As per the social structure of the society, sometimes, a son may not be in a position to maintain the parents, as particularly, in the present matter, the petitioner is residing in one room and there are other rooms, where the parents can live, therefore, it is needed to revisit the whole scenario that as to whether the present petitioner, is actually avoiding to maintain the parents,\" the Court said.\nMoreover, the bench noted that the District Magistrate, being an appellate authority under the Senior Citizen's Act, can ensure that no one hindered a senior citizen from enjoying the property as per his needs. Eviction is the last step in such cases when the authority finds that the needs of a senior citizen are not being fulfilled, the Court added.\nAs such, the Court quashed the petitioner's eviction and directed him not to inconvenience the needful living of his parents within the house. \n\"The case in hands is that the present petitioner is living in one room with his wife and he is not making any hindrance in the peaceful living of the parents, in other part of the house and therefore, so far as the objective of the Act, 2007 is concerned, is no way hampered by the petitioner. Consequently, the eviction order is quashed,\" the judge held.\nAdvocates Amol Kumar and Shivanshu Mishra appeared for the Petitioner.\nAdvocates Piyush Pathak, RP Shukla, Sharad Pathak, Sukhdeo Singh and Vidya Bhushan Pande represented the Respondents."}
{"ID": "id_145", "Summary": "The Supreme Court has published new guidelines to govern how lawyers would be appointed as Senior Advocates in the top Court, titled Guidelines for Designation of Senior Advocates by the Supreme Court of India, 2023.\nThese guidelines will supersede the earlier guidelines issued by the Court in 2018.\nNotably, the 2023 guidelines prescribe a minimum age of 45 years to apply for the senior gown. \nHowever, this restriction will not apply if the name has been recommended by the Chief Justice of India (CJI) or a judge of the Supreme Court. The age criterion may also be relaxed by the Supreme Court Committee that decides on senior designations. \nThe new guidelines have been framed two months after a three-judge bench of the Supreme Court passed its verdict in a related case. In the May 2023 judgment, the Court upheld the interview criteria followed by High Courts and the Supreme Court for designating lawyers as Senior Advocates but reduced the points given for the number of publications from 15 marks to 5. \nThe new guidelines, therefore, has a revised point-system for evaluating candidates. The points accorded for academic publications have been reduced to 5. Moreover, along with publications, teaching experience would also be considered for evaluation. \nThe number of points given for judgments has been increased from the earlier 40 to 50 points. \nFurther, opined in the May judgment, the new guidelines lay down that secret ballot voting should be resorted to only in exceptional cases. \nHighlights of the guidelines include the following. \nWho decides? \nMatters relating to the designation of Senior Advocates will be dealt with by the Permanent Committee known as the Committee for Designation of Senior Advocates (Committee).\nThis Committee will have 5 members, namely the Chief Justice of India (Chairperson), two senior-most Supreme Court judges, the Attorney General for India, and one member from the Bar who is nominated by the other members of the committee. \nThe Committee will meet twice a year and have a permanent secretariat, whose members will be decided by the Chief Justice of India in consultation with the other members of the Committee. \nWho are eligible to be conferred the senior gown?\nThe following criteria have to be satisfied before a lawyer can be considered for being designated a Senior Advocate:\nMinimum years of practice: At least 10 years standing as an advocate or at least 10 years combined standing as an advocate and a District and Sessions Judge/ as a Judicial Member of any Tribunal whose eligibility criteria for appointment is not less than what is required for appointment as a District Judge.\nArea of practice: The candidate's practice should be mainly before the Supreme Court. However, applicant-advocates who have domain expertise and practice before specialised tribunals may be given a concession.\nAge: The candidate must at least be 45 years old unless the age limit is relaxed by the Committee, or if the name has been recommended by the Chief Justice of India or a Supreme Court judge.\nFormer judges barred from applying if they are already engaged elsewhere: Former Chief Justices and former judges of the High Courts, who have accepted or consented to accept any full-time assignment will not be considered for designation as Senior Advocates as long as they hold that assignment.\nHow will lawyers be conferred the senior gown?\nThere are two modes envisioned under the guidelines:\na) On recommendation: The Chief Justice of India or any Supreme Court judge can recommend, in writing, the name of any advocate to be conferred the senior gown, on an opinion that such advocate (who should practice mainly in the Supreme Court) should be designated a senior advocate on account of her/ his standing at the Bar or special knowledge or experience in law. \nb) On application: The secretariat of the Committee will initiate the senior designation process at least once a year by inviting applications from advocates or advocates-on-record. This would be published on the official Supreme Court website. Further, it would also be intimated to the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) and the Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Association (SCAORA). Former Chief Justices and former Judges of the High Courts may also, at any time, submit a letter of request to the Committee for designation, which would be placed before the Full Court. \nApplicants would have 21 days to submit applications.\nThe secretariat will publish the proposals received for designation on the official website of the Supreme Court and invite suggestions/views of other stakeholders on the proposals for designation.\n15 days' time will be given to other stakeholders to give their suggestions or views on the proposed designation.\nThe Committee will short list candidates for an interview round. The names of short listed candidates and names cleared by the Committee would be placed before the Full Court.\nThere will be no voting by secret ballot save in an exceptional situations, for reasons to be recorded.\nThe final decision of the Full Court will be communicated individually to all the applicants.\nPoint-based system for evaluation of proposals\nThe guidelines have laid down a point-based system to guide how candidates may be evaluated to decide on whether they should be designated as a Senior Advocate. This point-based system runs as follows:\n20 points for number of years of practice from date of enrolment: Of this 10 points would be for 10 years of practice, and 1 point is given in addition for every additional year of practice, subject to a maximum of 20 points. \n 50 points for judgments reported and unreported (excluding orders that do not lay down any principle of law): Aspects such as the pro bono work done by the advocate, and domain expertise (such as constitutional law, Inter-State Water Disputes, Criminal law, Arbitration law, Corporate law, Family law, Human Rights, Public Interest Litigation, International law, law relating to women) would be considered.\n5 points for the publication of academic articles, experience of teaching assignments in the field of law, guest lectures delivered in law schools and professional institutions connected with law. \n25 points for the test of personality and suitability on the basis of interview for a holistic assessment of the applicant.\nCan candidates be reconsidered for designation?\nAll cases which are not favourably considered by the Full Court shall be reviewed or reconsidered after two years. This will not prevent the advocate from making an application to a High Court for designation as a Senior Advocate.\nAll cases deferred by the Full Court shall not be considered until the expiry of one year from the date of the decision of the Full Court. After the expiry of the period, the advocate may apply afresh. \nThe Full Court may review its decision to designate a person as a Senior Advocate and recall the conferment of designation if the advocate is found guilty of conduct that the Full Court feels would disentitle such advocate from being designated a Senior Advocate."}

{"ID": "id_1451", "Summary": "In cases concerning insurance claims, courts cannot adopt a beneficial or a welfare approach and must strictly go by the words used in the insurance policy, the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) recently held [Manager, LIC v Dolly Jose]\nPresiding Member Sudip Ahluwalia explained further that consumer forums cannot go beyond the specified terms and conditions specified in the insurance policy under the guise of a social welfare interpretation. \n\"It is also settled law that in the matter of insurance claims, the courts cannot adopt a beneficial/welfare approach, and have to go strictly by the words used in the concerned Insurance Policy ... In view of the decision of the Apex Court in “Export Credit Corporation Limited (Supra)” there can be no doubt that the Forum which decides on an insurance claim cannot go beyond the specified terms and conditions specified within words used in the policy or the relevant scheme, and cannot under the guise of a Social Welfare Interpretation extend the meaning of those words artificially,\" the order stated.\nThe Commission recounted that the Supreme Court, in Export Credit Guarantee Corporation of India Limited v. Garg Sons International, had earlier deprecated the liberal attitude adopted by NCDRC in awarding insurance claims in favour of the complainants, by extending the interpretation of the terms of the insurance policy beyond the words specified in the insurance document itself.\nThe NCDRC made these observations while allowing a revision plea filed by the Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) against orders to pay an additional amount of ₹10 lakh to a claimant under a Double-Accident Benefit insurance policy. \nIn this case, the husband of the complainant held a ₹ 10lakh LIC policy. Further, this was a Double Accident Benefit policy, which meant that double the payment of the sum assured would be paid under the policy, if the insured dies due to an accident during the tenure of the policy.\nThe husband of the claimant died on March 23, 2011 after falling from a train. After his wife submitted the claim before the LIC, she only received a sum of ₹10 lakh. \nShe filed a complaint before the district consumer forum, where she argued that she was entitled to ₹20 lakh since the policy was a Double Benefit policy. Since her husband died in an accident, she must be given double the amount assured, the commission was told.\nBoth the Kerala district consumer forum and the State commission passed order in favour of the complainant, prompting LIC challenge to these orders before the NCDRC.\nThe LIC relied on a clause in the insurance policy which provided that the insurer would not be liable to pay any additional sum if the disability or death of the insured was caused by, “intentional self injury, attempted suicide, insanity or immorality, or whilst the Life Assured is under the influence of intoxicating liquor, drug, narcotic...\"\nPertinently, LIC claimed that the insured was under the influence of alcohol when the accident occurred. Hence, the complainant was not entitled to the double-benefit amount, the Commission was told. \nThe NCDRC agreed with the said position, noting that the said clause clearly excluded the payment of the Double Accident Claim if the insured was under the influence of intoxicating liquor, drug, narcotic, etc. \nWhile so, it was noted that the ethyl alcohol found in the blood sample of the deceased (135.08 mg/100ml) was 4 ½ times over the permissible limit in India.\n\"Consequently, there is no scope for this Commission to come to any other conclusion as there remains no room to take any sympathetic view when the specific condition regarding the deceased to have not been under the intoxication or under the influence of alcohol, is found to have been violated,\" it was held.\nHence, the revision plea was filed by LIC challenging a 2016 Kerala State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission order was allowed."}

Feroz Ahmad Najar & Anr.].\nJustice Sanjay Dhar made the observation while upholding the acquittal of men against whom a rape case was filed by a woman in 2006.\n\"On the solitary statement of a victim of rape, conviction of an accused can be based but it is equally true that such statement should be unblemished and of sterling quality,\" the Court said.\nThe High Court was hearing an appeal filed by the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) challenging the judgment of acquittal passed by a Srinagar trial court in 2017.\nBy way of that judgment, the accused were acquitted of offences under Sections 363 (kidnapping), 376 (rape), 343 (wrongful confinement for three or more days), 506 (criminal intimidation), and 109 (abetment) of the Ranbir Penal Code.\nA first information report (FIR) had been registered against them at the Rainawari Police Station in Srinagar in 2006. \nAs per the prosecution, the father of the victim lodged a missing person complaint alleging that his daughter (prosecutrix) had gone to her school but she did not return on December 16, 2005.\nThe police launched a search of the prosecutrix and ultimately they succeeded in finding her at Central Jail in Jammu.\nIn a statement, the girl narrated that the accused men, along with a girl named Shazia, had enticed her to go with them to Jaipur, where she was allegedly raped. On the basis of the statement of the prosecutrix, a criminal case was filed against the accused. \nThe accused, however, claimed that the father of the prosecutrix had lodged a false case against them after an altercation between them. The accused alleged that the father had purchased a scooter from them but not paid the whole of the sale consideration despite repeated demands. \nSuch demands and ensuing altercations led to the filing of the false case, the accused argued. They also alleged that the prosecutrix was having an affair with someone else at the time, which had led to her running away from home to elope. \nThe trial court acquitted the accused on finding that the statements of the prosecutrix were not trustworthy and that her conduct was not unblemished. \nPertinently, the trial court found that the version of events narrated by the prosecutrix during the trial was entirely different from the version of events mentioned in the chargesheet. As such, the trial court acquitted the accused on January 1, 2017.\nThe government challenged the trial court verdict before the High Court.\nBefore the High Court, it was contended that a conviction can be recorded on the basis of a solitary statement of a victim of rape without any corroboration. On the other hand, the trial court had discarded the victim's statement on flimsy grounds, the government argued.\nHowever, the High Court rejected these contentions on finding that there were major contradictions in the statement of the prosecutrix. \n\"From the analysis of the statement of the prosecutrix recorded during trial of the case and the statement of the Investigating officer recorded during trial of the case, it is clear that there are major contradictions in her statements on the essential aspect of the case. These contradictions between the version of occurrence given in statement of the prosecutrix under section 161 of CrPC and her statement recorded during trial of the case have been proved during trial of the case,\" the High Court held.\nThe statement of the prosecutrix is unworthy of credit and the accused cannot be held guilty on the basis of her statement, the Court concluded.\n\"The view taken by the trial court in acquitting the respondents/accused and in holding that the statement of the prosecutrix is unworthy of credit does not deserve to be interfered with by this court while exercising appellate jurisdiction,\" the High Court observed.\nTherefore, it dismissed the appeal and upheld the acquittal of the accused. \nGovernment Advocate Sajad Ashraf appeared on behalf of the J&K government, while advocate Abu Owais Pandit appeared on behalf of the accused."}

Given that the Supreme Court will close for the Dussehra vacation starting tomorrow, an interim order was needed, Singh argued.\nSenior Advocate PS Narasimha, appearing for Punjab, and Additional Advocate General for Haryana Anil Grover sought to inform the Court of the steps taken by the states. \nAt this point, Additional Solicitor General Aishwarya Bhati told the Court that the Environmental Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA) was seized of the issue, and that the Centre is in contact with the concerned states.\nOn the basis of this, Bhati urged the Court not to direct appointment of the committee. She further submitted that the Centre and the EPCA may be heard by the Court on the date of reopening before passing any such orders.\nThe Court, however, clarified that the setting up of the committee would in no way be an indictment on the EPCA, and that its only concern was the quality of air in Delhi NCR. CJI Bobde said,\nThe Court thus directed for the setting up of the one-man committee of Justice Madan Lokur to look into steps to prevent stubble burning in Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh. The Court added further,\nThe states have been asked to provide assistance to the committee. It was also suggested that groups such as the National Cadet Corps (NCC), the National Service Scheme (NSS) or Bharat Scouts and Guides may be deployed to form mobile teams for identifying instances of stubble burning.\nFurthermore, the Court has directed the States to provide adequate assistance and facilities to the committee as well as the transport facility for those enlisted by the committee for carrying out patrolling work. \nWhile existing authorities such as the EPCA have also been asked to render their assistance to the Committee, the Court has also clarified that the formation of the committee will not dilute the powers of any authority that has been working on the issue of stubble burning. The Court records in its order thus,\nThe committee is required to submit a fortnightly report to the Court, or as and when it is required to do so. After passing these directions, the Court fixed the next date for hearing in the case on Monday, October 26.\nJust as the Bench was about to rise for the day, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta urged the Court not to sign its order for the appointment of the committee.\nOn being asked why he was making this request, Mehta said that there are some reservations and he may be heard by the Court on the next date of hearing before considering to set up the committee.\nThe Court then highlighted that the matter was heard at length for half an hour and the recommendation was made for appointment and consent from the judge was already sought. Thus it could not go back on its order.\n\"Recommendation was made by the petitioner, consent was taken by them. We were not even put on notice\", Mehta said.\nHowever, the CJI said that the issue concerns the states and not the Centre. He also made it clear that Justice Lokur was not being conferred with some extraordinary jurisdiction or powers. Nevertheless, Mehta still pressed for the Court to consider not finalising this order. Ultimately, the Court declined the SG's request.\nRead Order:"}

{"ID": "id_1471", "Summary": "The Supreme Court on Monday set aside a judgment of the Delhi High Court which had directed the National High Speed Rail Corporation Limited (NHSRCL) to consider the bid of infrastructure company Montecarlo Limited for construction and development of a depot in relation to the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train project [NHSRCL v. Montecarlo Ltd].\nA Bench of Justices MR Shah and AS Bopanna said that the project is of 'national importance,' and set aside the August 2021 verdict of the High Court. \nThe NHSRCL had rejected Montecarlo's bid and awarded the contract to SCC-VRS(JV). Montecarlo had then approached the Delhi High Court contending that no reasons were assigned while rejecting the bid. \nThe top court held that the High Court ought to have appreciated that the Bullet Train Project is a result of long-drawn deliberations between the Government of India on the one hand and the Government of Japan on the other.\nIt further observed that Japan has agreed to fund a huge amount for the project. \n“Such a huge sum/amount is funded by the developed nation to implement the project meant for development of the developing nation – the Republic of India. The contracts are entered into and the huge sum is funded on the basis of non-negotiated terms and conditions and therefore, the foreign developed nation, who has agreed to invest/fund such a huge amount is always justified in insisting for their own terms and conditions on which such a huge amount is funded,” the top court held.\nImportantly, Supreme Court has held that scope of judicial review in such foreign funded contract should be far much less than the ordinary Government funded contracts funded from Consolidated Fund of India.\n\"The scope of judicial review in such foreign funded contracts/projects would be restricted and minimal. In such foreign funded contracts, the only ground for judicial review ought to be on a limited aspect, i.e., the action of the executing authority does not suffer from favouritism or nepotism and based on the grounds which have been concealed from the foreign financing authority, if disclosed, would have persuaded the financing authority to cancel the contract,\" the Court said while dismissing the plea.\nThe bullet train project was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2017, in partnership with Japan. The project was expected to be completed by 2022 at an estimated cost of ₹1.10 lakh crore. It is reported that around 1,400 hectares of land will be acquired in Gujarat and Maharashtra for the project. Around 6,000 landowners will have to be compensated.\nIn 2019, the Gujarat High Court had dismissed various petitions filed by farmers and landowners challenging land acquisition for the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train project."}
{"ID": "id_1474", "Summary": "The Delhi High Court recently clarified that family courts cannot grant divorce on the ground of there being an irretrievable breakdown of marriage. [D v. A]\nDealing with the case at hand, which involved Hindu parties, the Court observed that the family court must act strictly in accordance with the provisions governing the grant divorce under the Hindu Marriage Act.\nThe division bench of Justices Sanjeev Sachdeva and Vikas Mahajan highlighted that an irretrievable breakdown of marriage is not a ground for divorce under the Hindu Marriage Act, while setting aside a family court judgment granting divorce on such a ground, among other grounds.\nThe High Court explained that the power to grant divorce on the ground of irretrievable breakdown of marriage can be exercised only by the Supreme Court under Article 142 of the Constitution. \n“Such a power is not vested in the High Courts leave alone the Family Courts,” the bench added.\nThe Court was hearing a woman’s appeal against a family court's 2018 decision to allow her husband’s plea for divorce on the grounds of cruelty and desertion. \nThe couple married in 2002 and a daughter was born to them in 2007. Soon they started living separately.\nThe High Court noted that the family court had granted the divorce on the ground of denial of conjugal relationship, even though the allegations regarding this aspect were vague and without specifics. \nIt further observed that there was never any complete denial as the husband had admitted that he was allowed to enjoy conjugal relations 30-35 times. The Court also said birth of the girl child negates the allegation of denial of conjugal rights.\nOn the aspect of whether there was a breakdown of marriage, the Court noted that the wife had consistently maintained that she wanted to live with the husband, but that he had repeatedly declined to live with her. She was clearly not at fault, the High Court opined.\n“He is the one who is found to have deserted his wife and then taken the plea of desertion on her part. He cannot be permitted to walk out of the matrimonial alliance on the ground that the marriage has broken down,” the Court said.\nThe Court also noted that the family court merely considered the fact that the couple had been living separately for 11 years and granted divorce on that ground. However, the High Court pointed out that such power is not conferred on the family court. \nEven the Supreme Court while considering the exercise of its discretionary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution of India takes into account several factors, the High Court added. The longevity of the period of separation is only one of such factors, the Court observed.\n“In the present case, the Family Court has erred in travelling beyond the scope of its powers to grant divorce,” the division bench proceeded to conclude, while allowing the woman’s appeal against grant of divorce.\nAdvocates Lohit Ganguly, Ajay Kumar and Mohit Khatri represented the appellant (wife).\nAdvocates DK Pandey and Vikram Panwar represented the defendant (husband)."}

Matthew 18:15-17 states that in case of a deadlock, the parties should contact a third neutral party to get their issue resolved. Even in Islam, the Holy Qur'an, the Sunna, the Ijma, and the Qiyas support peaceful conflict settlement within the Islamic community, between Islamic and non-Islamic communities, and between two or more non-Muslim communities.... Arthashastra (अथथशास्त्र) by Kautilya and the principles enumerated by the judges, commentaries, lectures and mediation training on mediation process will have the potential to give finality to disputes between the parties,” the judgment stated.\nThe Court, however, made it clear that cases under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO Act) cannot be referred to mediation and settled or compromised.\nThe Court made the observations while dealing with a plea filed by a man to set aside a trial court order that had closed a complaint filed under Section 7 of the POCSO Act in the year 2015.\nSection 7 punishes a person who “with sexual intent touches the vagina, penis, anus or breast of the child or makes the child touch the vagina, penis, anus or breast of such person or any other person, or does any other act with sexual intent which involves physical contact without penetration is said to commit sexual assault”.\nThe complaint was filed by the father of two children (one boy, one girl) alleging that they were inappropriately touched by their uncle (mother’s brother).\nThe trial court had referred the disputes between the complainant man and his wife including the registration of POCSO complaint, to mediation and then closed the complaint based on the settlement achieved by the two sides.\nHowever, the complainant-man later approached the High Court against the trial court order arguing that he was tricked into withdrawing the complaint by his wife and brother-in-law.\nAfter considering the case, Justice Sharma said that the offences under POCSO Act cannot be referred to mediation, settled or compromised and no monetary payment can result in resolution of these cases.\nShe observed that any attempt to mediate or compromise the cases under POCSO Act undermines the principles of justice and rights of victims and they must not be entertained under any circumstances by a mediator.\nHowever, in the present case, the Court refused to revive the complaint observing that nine years have passed since the trial court order and facts revealed that the children were being used by the parents to settle their personal scores.\n“Therefore, in view of the detailed discussion made in the preceding paragraphs, this Court is not inclined to allow the reliefs sought in this petition i.e. quashing of order dated 08.04.2015 and restoration/revival of complaint which was filed under POCSO Act before the learned Special Court when the victims themselves have not prayed for the same, and thus, the prayer in this petition stands rejected,\" the Court ordered while rejecting the father's plea.  \nAdvocates Rajat Wadhwa, Dhreti Bhatia, Gurpreet Singh, Nikhil Mehta and Himanshu Nailwal appeared for petitioner Rajeev Dagar.\nAdditional Standing Counsel (ASC) Rupali Badhopadhya appeared for the State.\nAdvocates Gitesh Aneja and Lakshay Kumar represented the respondent mother and her brother."}

(Sarath KP v. National University of Advanced Legal Studies)\nJustice Amit Rawal issued the direction after hearing the student petitioners and the University.\nThe students had moved the Court seeking a waiver of fees for those facilities which are not being availed by the petitioners, and on which the University is not incurring any expenditure, due to the absence of physical classes amid the pandemic.\nIn the hearing today, Advocate Santhosh Mathew, appearing for the students, submitted that the University was burdening the students with the expenses of the tenders raised towards construction on campus. \nHe argued that the principle of quid pro quo should govern any fee charged. Since physical classes were not in progress, the fee levied for gym, sports, fitness, moot court, student council etc. was not justified, he contended.\nAppearing for the University and the other respondents, Advocate Dr Thushara James maintained that the University had allowed substantial deductions based on a Student Council Representation and that a strict principle of quid pro quo for fee collection cannot be applied to the services of educational institutions, particularly National Law Universities.\nThere were many other expenses that were met by the fees. Therefore, only reductions against the gross fee charged (including tuition fees) would be permissible, she asserted.\nReductions ranging from 25-30% had already been allowed in certain heads of fees, she submitted. A deduction of 50% had been granted for the fee charged on account of Student Council levies, Dr James added. Further, the University had provided an option of paying the entire fee in instalments, which only 3 of the 28 petitioners had availed, she submitted.\n\"This is a peculiar situation\", she said making reference to the fact that only 3 had availed of the facility.\nAdvocate Mathew relied on the recent Calcutta High Court Division Bench decision restraining private schools from charging fees in respect of facilities not availed amid the pandemic.\nHowever, taking note of the stipulation the judges had made in that decision, viz. that the decision was not to be considered a precedent, the Justice Rawal did not accept the judgment.\nThe Judge went on to emphasize that ordinarily, the Court could not interfere in matters of this nature, particularly because the NUALS Act empowered the Executive Council to take decisions of this kind.\n\"The Court cannot sit as an appellate court under Article 226,\" the Judge observed.\nHowever, in the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case particularly in light of the state of the economy and incomes amid the pandemic, the Court directed the Executive Council to consider a 100% deduction under certain heads of fees, against the 25-30% already allowed. The Court directed the Council to reconsider the issue within 15 days from the date of judgment.\nPertinently, the Court recorded the fact that the tuition fee charged was not challenged.\nDirecting the Council to draw up a revised schedule for the payment of fees and allow opportunities to students to avail of the instalment option without charging a late fee, the petition was disposed of.\nThe result of the writ petition was to be apply to all students in NUALS, not just the petitioners, the Court clarified.\nRead the Order:"}

However, it limited the back wages payable to 50 percent.\nThe judicial officer, Dwivedi had argued that he had a successful stint and had received continued appreciative assessment for his services. \nThe High Court administration, in response, informed the Court that the termination was not punitive. It was also submitted that a number of complaints had been made against the judicial officer and thus his service was not continued. \nDwivedi maintained that these complaints arose due to some enmity harboured by a district judge. \nThe Court opined though the appointing authority can terminate the services of a probationer even without inquiry or explanation, there should be some material on record for such action. \nThe termination should be based on some relevant material so that if the termination is challenged, the authority must be able to satisfy the Court that there were reasonable grounds for the decision.\nIt added that in this case, there was a total absence of such material.\nLooking into Dwivedi’s service records, the Court found that while he was posted at Bikramganj, there was a complaint made by some advocates against him. In 2011, he was asked to remain careful in his behaviour and maintain judicial aloofness. \nIt also noted there was later a complaint with respect to Dwivedi having allegedly granted permission to construct a temple on the court premises.

Critical analysis of a judgment in right perspective has to be appreciated but casting allegations upon a Judge if allowed would hit at the root of the system of justice,” the Court said.\nThe Court was hearing a petition challenging a district court’s order in a matter related to the management of a temple trust. \nOne of the prayers in the petition before the High Court was to transfer the case to a different judge. The petition alleged that the Presiding Officer was acting in connivance with a lawyer by not treating the service of summons as complete in the suit. \nHowever, after considering the submissions and material on record, the High Court found that the trial court had rightly observed that the service was incomplete in the suit. \nIt thus refused to interfere with the trial court's order.\nOn the allegations made against the Presiding Officer, the Court observed that the apprehension of petitioners had sprung from the fact the judge had denied their request for treating the service of summons as complete.\nThe Court opined that the petitioners have the right to challenge the decision before a higher court, rather than seeking a transfer of the trial to another court.\n\"Such practice (casting aspersions on a judge to seek a transfer of the case) is deprecated and in case the judicial order passed by the learned District Judge is not acceptable to the petitioners, then it is open for them to challenge the same on judicial side. It is expected from the lawyers to maintain all the restraint and not make allegations against a Presiding Officer,\" the Court added. \nIt also noted that petitioners had mentioned that a complaint was filed by the Jalore Bar against the Presiding Officer, which was pending before the High Court's Chief Justice. \nThe Court said that even if such a complaint is pending, “the rights of the Bar and the individual lawyers cannot become a ground for pleading on the judicial side.\"\nThe Court also referred to Section 1 of the Judicial Officers Protection Act and observed that it contains the common law on rule of immunity of judges based on the principle that a person holding office should be in a position to discharge his functions with complete independence.\nThe Court concluded that no interference was required in the order under challenge, and decided to impose costs on the petitioners.\n“The petitioner is directed to deposit the cost of Rs.10,000/- before the Rajasthan State Legal Services Authority, Jodhpur,” it ordered.\nAdvocates CS Kotwani and Swati Shekhar represented the petitioners."}

The order was supported by the State government. The protest took a violent turn on its 100th day when police opened fire on the protesters, leading to several civilian casualties. \nVedanta subsequently challenged the closure order before the National Green Tribunal, which ruled in the company’s favour and allowed the re-opening of the plant.\nIn February 2019, the Supreme Court set aside the NGT order on the ground that the Tribunal did not have the jurisdiction to entertain the case.

He also noted that the Central government has revisional powers which could be exercised in these circumstances.\nHe added that the CBFC may not revisit the certificate already issued, particularly since a disclaimer has been shown in the film that it is not the Ramayana.\nThe Court, however, questioned whether such a disclaimer was sufficient to claim that the film is not on the Ramayana.\n\"When the filmmaker has shown Lord Rama, Devi Sita, Lord Laxman, Lord Hanuman, Ravan, Lanka etc., then as to how the disclaimer of the film would convince the people at large that the story is not from Ramayana?\" the Court asked.\nDuring the hearing, advocate Ranjana Agnihotri, representing one of the petitioners, drew the Court's attention to objectionable, colored photographs that were sourced from the film, Adipurush.\nShe contended that certain dialogues in the film, as well as the portrayal of Lord Rama, Devi Sita, Lord Hanuman, Ravan, and Vibhishana's wife, among others, had deviated from the guidelines set forth for such depictions. \nIn this regard, she referred to the guidelines for the certification of films for public exhibition, as outlined in Section 5-B (2)of the Cinematograph Act, 1952.\nThe petitioners have called for an immediate ban on the movie, as it not only negatively impacts the sentiments of those who worship Lord Rama, Devi Sita, Lord Hanuman, and others, but also has the potential to cause significant social disharmony due to the manner in which the characters of the Ramayana have been portrayed.\nThe Court was hearing a plea filed by social activists Kuldeep Tiwari and Bandana Kumar, who were represented by advocates Ranjana Agnihotri and Sudha Sharma.\nThe petitioners asserted that the movie in question cast doubt on the integrity of the revered epic Ramayana and defamed the cultural heritage of Ayodhya as well as the Hindu religion.\nThe movie's trailer was clumsy and indecent, which has resulted in hurting the religious sentiments of Hindus, the plea stated. \nThe petitioner's further noted that despite the Allahabad High Court issuing a notice to the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) during a hearing held in January 2023, the board has not yet responded in the matter.\nRecently, an amendment application was filed to include the film's dialogue writer, Manoj Muntashir Shukla, as a party in the case. \nThe amendment application also objected to the dialogues written by Shukla, terming them to be ridiculous, 'filthy', and 'against the glory of Ramayan yug'.\nThe matter is slated to be heard again this afternoon."}
{"ID": "id_1498", "Summary": "Designation of a lawyer as a Senior Advocate is a privilege conferred upon such a lawyer based on merit and not a post which a lawyer can claim entitlement to, the Madras High Court ruled last week. \nHence, lawyers cannot claim any reservation for senior designation including based on gender, the High Court said in its judgement passed on December 23.\nA bench of Justices M Sundar and N Sathish, therefore, dismissed a writ petition praying that 30 to 50 percent of the total designated senior counsel in any appellate court should be women lawyers.\nThe petitioner, S Lawrence Vimalraj, a lawyer from Madurai district, had approached the Court seeking reservation for women saying that the same was imperative to ensure greater representation of women lawyers in courts. \nThe Court, however, held that Vimalraj was neither an aggrieved party himself, nor was the petition a public interest litigation on behalf of others. He therefore, had no locus standi in the matter, the Court said. \nThe bench also examined the petition on merits.  \n\"It is relevant to note that designating an advocate as a Senior Advocate is a matter of honour and privilege conferred upon a member of the Bar. This Court is of the view that such privilege and honour cannot be based on reservation. It must be purely based on the merit cum ability and successful career of the member of the Bar irrespective of the gender of the member at the Bar,\" the bench made it clear.\nJustice Sundar, who authored the lead verdict, noted that in 2022, a total of 161 lawyers from the Madras High Court had applied for Senior gown. Out of that, only 9 were women. Two of those women applicants did not attend the interaction with a committee headed by the acting Chief Justice, Justice Sundar noted. \nTherefore, going by the statistics alone, it was apparent that there was no way to reserve 30 percent of the designation for women lawyers alone. \nHe further said that the Advocates Act of 1961 prescribes Rules for designation of Senior counsel and proposes four methods for nominating lawyers for such designation. These methods do not make room for any distinction on the basis of gender, the Court highlighted. \nIn his separate but concurring opinion, Justice Sathish Kumar traced the history of designation of Senior Advocate. \nHe said that Section 16(2) of the Advocates Act clearly emphasises the senior designation is a distinction conferred upon lawyers and not something that came about automatically upon achieving known or predetermined standards.  \n“It is a privilege based upon the opinion of the court considering ability, standing at the Bar or special knowledge of or experience in law. Thus, it is a subjective decision, though, based on objective considerations.

It is reiterated that the timeline specified must be adhered to, without any delay to the further investigation and trial of the case. The writ petition is allowed as above,\" the Court said in its judgment.\nIn 2017, a popular Malayalam cine actress was abducted, raped and videotaped in a moving vehicle by several persons allegedly at the behest of Dileep in an attempt to take revenge on the actress who is believed to have played a role in Dileep's divorce from his now ex-wife. \nThe said memory card contains the video recording of the assault and is a crucial piece of evidence in the ongoing trial in the 2017 case and has been marked as an exhibit before the Additional Sessions (CBI special No III) Court in Ernakulam where Dileep and his associates are undergoing trial.\nDuring an examination of the memory card at a forensic science laboratory, it was supposedly noticed by experts that there was a change in the hash value of the card, which indicates that it had been accessed. At the time, the card had been in the custody of the trial court.\nThough this change in the hash value was reported to the trial court in January 2020, it was not disclosed to the prosecution till February 2022.\nThe prosecution immediately requested another forensic examination of the card as part of the further investigation that was allowed by the High Court. However, the trial court dismissed the request, prompting the prosecution to approach the High Court by way of the instant plea.\nThe prosecution, led by Director General of Prosecution, Senior Advocate TA Shaji, argued that forensic examination to ascertain the impact of the change in hash value is absolutely essential so as to prevent the accused and their defense counsel from taking undue advantage of the same.\nIt was argued that the trial court's refusal of another forensic examination is illegal and amounts to interference in the investigation which is in the sole realm of the investigating agency. \nOn the other hand, advocate Philip T Varghese, representing Dileep, contended that the prosecution was once again attempting to protract an already delayed trial. \nHe also argued that forensic examination would only be able to tell if the card was accessed, not what exactly was done when it was accessed. \nMoreover, he pointed out that there is a cloned copy of the memory card with a forensic science lab which can be used for the purpose of the comparison.\nThe survivor actress has also moved a plea before the Kerala High Court alleging foul play in the investigation into Dileep.

A fresh Notification shall be issued within seven days from today for elections to constitute the 5th Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council, Kargil. R1 [NC party] is declared entitled to the exclusive allotment of the Plough symbol for candidates proposed to be put up by it. Accordingly, this appeal stands dismissed\", the Court said in its order.\nPertinently, the bench imposed costs of ₹1 lakh on the Ladakh administration and asked it to deposit the same with the Supreme Court Advocates on Record Welfare Fund, within two weeks. \nThe Court dismissed an appeal filed by the Union Territory (UT) of Ladakh against an August 9 order of the High Court of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh.\nThe High Court had ordered the Ladakh administration to notify the allotment of the 'plough' symbol to the National Conference party for the purpose of the LAHDC elections.\nThe National Conference party had claimed that the authorities were not notifying the allotment of the plough symbol to the LAHDC elections in Ladakh, even though the symbol was earlier reserved in the party's favour.\nDeputy Solicitor General of India (DSGI) TM Shamsi had contended before the High Court that the National Conference was not a recognised State Political Party in the Union Territory of Ladakh. The reservation of the plough symbol in the party's favour was only with respect to the Union Territory of Jammu & Kashmir, he had contended.\nThe High Court, however, proceeded to allow the National Conference to approach the authorities again in the matter, so that the allotment of the plough symbol in its favour may be notified for the purpose of the LAHDC elections.\nBefore the Supreme Court, Additional Solicitor General KM Nataraj, appearing for the Ladakh administration, reiterated the government's stance that the National Conference was not a national party to be automatically eligible for the allotment of this symbol.\nThe top court at the outset noted that the contention by the Ladakh administration that it can take an independent stand in the symbol allotment matter was different from what they had argued before the High Court.\nThe Court criticised the UT authorities for delaying the process of allotment of the symbol despite the High Court's orders in this regard.\n\"Elections to any office/body are required to be free, fair and transparent. Elections lie at the core of democracy. The authority entrusted by law to hold/conduct such elections is to be completely independent of any extraneous influence/consideration. It is surprising that the Union Territory of Ladakh not only denied R1 the Plough symbol, but even upon timely intervention by the learned Single Judge, has left no stone unturned not only to resist but also frustrate a cause simply by efflux of time.\"\nThe bench noted that a representation by the party ahead of the polls had gone unheeded.\n\"This Court notes, with concern, that the Appellants, while sitting on the representation of R1, went ahead and notified the elections on 02/05.08.2023.

Instances like these raise serious questions.\"\nIt noted that the NC's request to be allotted the plough symbol was just, legitimate and and bonafide. Further, there was no conflict with any other party with regard to the symbol.\n\"Upon bifurcation of the erstwhile State of Jammu and Kashmir and the creation of two new Union Territories, namely the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir and the Union Territory of Ladakh, though the ECI had not notified R1 as a State Party for the Union Territory of Ladakh, it cannot be simpliciter that R1 was not entitled for the allotment of plough symbol to it, in the factual background.

It explained that it has powers to restore status quo ante by turning the clock if dire measures call for it.\n\"The Court would categorically emphasize that no litigant should have even an iota of doubt or an impression (rather, a misimpression) that just because of systemic delay or the matter not being taken up by the Courts resulting in efflux of time the cause would be defeated, and the Court would be rendered helpless to ensure justice to the party concerned,\" the judgment said.\nIt underscored that the High Court had no bar, even on principle, in issuing the directions.\nBefore parting, the bench flagged the fact that authorities were interfering in election processes arbitrarily in the hope that courts will not interfere. \n\"This case constrains the Court to take note of the broader aspect of the lurking danger of authorities concerned using their powers relating to elections arbitrarily and thereafter, being complacent, rather over-confident, that the Courts would not interfere. The misconceived notion being that in the ultimate eventuate, after elections are over, when such decisions/actions are challenged, by sheer passage of time, irreversible consequences would have occurred, and no substantive relief could be fashioned is just that – misconceived.\" \nSuch conduct compelled the top court to rethink whether self-imposed restrictions on meddling in elections need a more liberal interpretation to ensure justice in some cases, it was observed.\n\"With a sense of anguish, it would not be wrong to say that the instant judgment has been invited upon themselves by the Appellants. The orders of the High Court, in our considered opinion, were in aid of the electoral process, and no fault can be found therewith.\""}

The manner in which she was treated during the course of the incident indicates that her womanhood, pride, prestige and dignity was defiled. The accused persons satisfied their lust in a shameful manner. The accused persons took advantage of the situation,\" the Court said.\nThe bench was seized of criminal appeals filed by Ashwin Donode (28), Anil Ingle (35), Roshan Ingle (35), Pundlik Bhoyar (34) and Mohammad Afroz Pathan (38) challenging the order passed by a sessions court in Nagpur on October 23, 2018.\nThe sessions court had convicted all of them under charges of gangrape (376D), kidnapping (366), common intention (34) and criminal intimidation (506) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).\nAs per the prosecution case, the victim, a convent school teacher along with a male friend was standing near a Highway in Nagpur at around 8 pm on December 1, 2014 when the accused, who were on their bikes, stopped and enquired as to what she was doing with the boy on the highway. \nThey posed themselves as policemen. When she asked for their identity cards, the men forcibly made her sit on her motorbike and her friend was made to sit on another bike. They then threatened them at knife point and asked them to co-operate.\nSensing the threat, her friend escaped and ran to a nearby police station seeking help but by then the girl was taken to a forest area and was raped.\nIn its order, the Court noted that the testimony of the victim was trust worthy as she had narrated the details of the incident and had remained steadfast on her statements during cross-examination. \nIt noted that the victim identified all the accused since she had seen them from the light of their bikes, while they forced themselves on her. \nThe Court further noted that one of the accused, Bhoyar had a fractured leg at the relevant time and thus couldn't perform sexual intercourse with the victim. Yet he was convicted as his semen samples were found in the cervix of the victim. \n\"It is to be noted that the victim in such a fearful state of mind, might not have sensed the penetration. However, positive DNA report clearly indicates that this accused also had a penetrative sexual intercourse with the victim, otherwise, there was no reason to detect his semen in the cervix of the victim,\" the judges noted.\nReagrding the contention of the accused that there wasn't any injury on the person of the victim, the bench reasoned that she would have been helpless and thus submitted herself.\n\"On the basis of the first hand vivid account of the incident narrated by the victim, one can visualise the precarious position of the victim in the custody of the accused. They had threatened the victim of dire consequences, if she did not submit to their lust. There were two minor injuries on her back. The major injuries might not have caused because the victim was helpless and could not resist. There was no alternative before the victim than to submit to the commands of the accused,\" the bench opined.\nThe Court further relied upon the DNA results that connected all the five men to the crime.\nAdvocates C R Thakur and S R Shinde appeared for the convicts.\nAdditional Public Prosecutor S S Doifode represented the state."}

Since the husband has not disputed his liability towards the amount of maintenance as well as educational expenses, it is his morale and legal responsibility to maintain the wife who is unable to maintain herself,\" Justice Dangre underscored. \nWith these observations, the bench, dismissed the husband's plea\nAdvocate RR Vyas appeared for the husband. \nAdvocate IA Fidvi represented the wife."}
{"ID": "id_151", "Summary": "A father who took away his child from the custody of the mother cannot be booked for kidnapping under the Indian Penal Code, the Nagpur bench of the Bombay High Court recently held [Ashish Anilkumar Mule vs State of Maharashtra].\nIn the absence of any prohibition by the order of a competent court, the applicant-father cannot be booked for taking away his own minor child from the custody of his mother, the Court ruled.\nA division bench of Justices Vinay Joshi and Valmiki SA Menezes quashed a case registered against a man under Section 363 (kidnapping) of IPC for allegedly taking away his three-year-old son who was under his estranged wife's custody. \nIn a judgment delivered on October 6, the Court said that no biological father could be booked for kidnapping his own child merely because he took away the kid from his wife.\n\"The effect of natural father taking away the child from custody of the mother in real sense amounts to taking a child from the lawful guardianship of the mother to the another lawful guardianship of the father. Natural father of the minor child is also a lawful guardian along with the mother, and therefore, father of the minor cannot be said to have committed the offence of kidnapping,\" the Court held. \nIt referred to the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act of 1956 which defines the \"natural guardians\" of a child and said that it was abundantly clear that the applicant father before it, was a natural guardian of a minor in absence of an order otherwise passed by a court of competent jurisdiction. \n\"If the minor of the age specified in the law, is taken out of the custody of the lawful guardian of such a minor, then the offence would be complete. It is nota case that the mother was lawfully entrusted with the care or custody of the minor by the order of competent Court,\" the Court observed. \nIn case at hand, the applicant is a natural guardian and he is a lawful guardian too along with the mother, the order said.\nIn the absence of any prohibition by the order of a competent court, the applicant father cannot be booked for taking away his own minor child from the custody of his mother. \n\"The expression “Guardian” under Section 4(2) of the Guardians and Wards Act, encompasses any person who is having the care of the person of a minor or of his property. Therefore, in our view in absence of legal prohibition, a father cannot be booked for the offence of kidnapping of his own child,\" the bench underlined. \nTherefore, the father of a child will not come within the scope of section of 361 of the IPC even if he takes away the child from the mother, the Court stated.\nA mother may be a lawful guardian as against any person except the father or any other person who has been appointed as a legal guardian by a court. \n\"So long there is no divestment of the rights of the guardianship of a father, he cannot be guilty of an offence under Section 363 of the IPC,\" the bench made it clear. \nBased on these facts, the Court held that no prima facie case was made out against the applicant before it.\n\"Continuation of such prosecution amounts to abuse of the process of the Court, hence, the application is allowed. We hereby quash and set aside the First Information Report (FIR) registered against the applicant,\" the bench said while quashing the case. \nAdvocates Pavan Dahat and AB Moon appeared for the applicant.\nAdditional Public Prosecutor Ghodeswar represented the State. \nAdvocate VN Mate represented the complainant."}

Hence, this Court is of the view that a registration of crime and conducting investigation are abuse of process of law and, hence, the proceedings in the crime are liable to be quashed,\" the High Court noted while quashing the case against private respondents.\nThis led to the present appeal before the top court. \nThe Supreme Court in its judgment held that the reasoning given by the High Court was totally unsustainable. \n\"The effect of this reasoning is that fabrication of documents is permissible if it does not cause loss to the revenue!

It is true the husband didn't opt for a DNA test and didn't raise the contention in the proceedings filed by his wife seeking maintenance. But, merely on this ground, the material fact cannot be overlooked and it cannot be held that she was not leading an adulterous life, as held by the Family Court,\" the Bench held.\nNotably, the husband's plea for divorce was dismissed by a family court in Bilaspur on the ground that he didn't opt for a DNA test while alleging adultery against his wife.\nFurther, the High Court took note of the fact that the wife had filed a First Information Report (FIR) against her husband and in-laws claiming domestic violence and dowry demand. It noted that the said FIR was lodged after nearly 12 years of their marriage which took place in 1996.\n\"True, it is, that the husband and his family have been acquitted, but it appears that no allegations as such were ever made by the wife prior to lodging of the alleged FIR in 2008, based upon which the husband was put in jail for some time. Levelling allegations after such a long time would have thus caused a mental cruelty upon him,\" the Court ruled.\nThe judges further noted that the marriage between the couple has irretrievably broken down, and therefore, it is dead for all purposes and cannot be revived. Therefore, the Court granted a decree of divorce to the husband under Section 13 (1)(i) of the Hindu Marriage Act.\nThe Bench further noted that prior to the couple's 24 days living together, the husband was bed-ridden after suffering a leg fracture.\n\"Proof beyond reasonable doubt is not postulated where human relationship is involved and eye witnesses are difficult to obtain and thus direct evidence to prove adultery is not possible and has to be inferred from circumstances which exclude any presumption of innocence in favour of the person against whom it is alleged. In view thereof, it is evident that the wife had sexual intercourse with some one else other than her husband and he is, therefore, entitled to a decree for dissolution of marriage on the ground enumerated under Section 13 (1) (i) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955,\" the bench held.\nAdvocate Dharmesh Shrivastava appeared for the husband."}

The anticipatory bail plea in this case was closed by the Court recently noting that the offence alleged is a available one.\nBabu first approached the Court for anticipatory bail in the rape case, contending that the complaint against him was an attempt to blackmail him and that there wasn't any non-consensual relationship.\nThe plea, filed through advocate S Rajeev, alleged that the police is guided by the intense media scrutiny and speculations relating to the case.\nOn May 31, the Court granted him interim protection from arrest so that Babu would return from Dubai, where he had been since the case was registered. \nThe State prosecution led by Additional Director General of Prosecution (ADGP), Senior Advocate Gracious Kuriakose, primarily argued on the basis of maintainability of the plea on account of the fact that it was moved when Babu was absconding.\nHowever, the Court opined that Section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) does not contain such a restrictive mandate as a person can apprehend arrest even when he is outside the country for an offence that occurred in India.\n\"Therefore, I am of the considered view that an application for pre-arrest bail can be filed even by a person residing outside the country. However, the only limitation is that prior to the final hearing, the applicant must be inside the country to enable the court to impose and enforce conditions contemplated under the statutory provisions\", the Court said.\nAdvocate R Rajesh, appearing for the de-facto complainant, opposed the bail plea arguing that the evidence tendered by the complainant must be viewed without prejudice, especially since Babu had admitted to the police that he did engage in sexual intercourse with her.\nThe Court, however, said in its order that at the stage of anticipatory bail, it is not proper to meticulously analyse materials collected by the investigation which is meant for the stage of trial. \n\"In this phase of legal proceedings, this Court is only to consider the competing claims of liberty of an individual guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India as against the power of investigation of the police against a person accused of a serious crime,\" the Court said in its order allowing the anticipatory bail plea.\nRead more about the order here."}

Therefore, he deemed it fit to grant anticipatory bail while also protecting the interests of the other parties to the suit. \n\"...releasing the accused on anticipatory bail and allowing the infringement to continue so as to permit the infringer of the copyright to take benefit out of the same, could not be done.

Resultantly, the copyright holder's right to enjoy benefit out of the copyright protected subject matter practically will be taken away,\" the judge reasoned. \nHowever, the Court's order made it clear that they can move the appropriate civil court to get an expeditious decision on the copyright infringement allegations.\nThe duo were also directed to co-operate with the investigation, make themselves available for interrogation, and refrain from influencing witnesses, tampering with evidence, or getting involved in any other offence. \nShetty and Kiragandur were arrayed as accused in a (first information report) FIR registered alleging commission of the offence punishable under Section 63 of the Copyright Act by using the music of Navarasam in Varaha Roopam.\nSeeking anticipatory bail, the duo argued that Varaha Roopam is an independent creation having no connection with Navarasam. \nEven the prosecution has not collected any material to prove that Varaha Roopam is similar or deceptively similar. Instead, the prosecution has merely relied on the opinion of someone who viewed the film and saw some similarities, the petitioners argued.\nOn the other hand, the Public Prosecutor opposed the grant of anticipatory bail on the ground that it would hamper the investigation. It was further argued that the prosecution had collected material that prima facie substantiated the allegations in the FIR. \nThe Court first reiterated that the offence alleged is a cognisable and non-bailable offence. \nOn going through the opinion collected by the investigating officer, it opined that the same prima facie indicated similarity between the two songs. \n\"In addition to that the Investigating Officer, on gathering opinion from expert, reported that `VARAHAROOPAM' is, the plagiarized and pirated version of `NAVARASAM'.

There is a big queue for child adoption,” the Chief Justice had said. \nIt further said that it is not forcing the woman to raise the child and everything will be looked after by the government or hospital.\n“I am willing to pay,” the Chief Justice remarked.\nThe judge had also asked Senior Advocate Kapil Sibal – who was present in the courtroom -- for his views.\nSibal said, in his opinion, the child should not be aborted at this stage.\nCounsel appearing for the woman, however, told the court that the continuation of pregnancy will have an adverse impact on her physical and mental health.\nThe judges then asked counsel to obtain instructions from the petitioner and listed the case for hearing in the post-lunch session.\nAfter talking to the petitioner, the counsel informed the court that she is not willing to continue the pregnancy.\nThe bench, however, said that the law does not permit killing the child."}

The dowry was stated to be her share of property. \n“If at all the plaintiff was allotted her share in the family properties at the time of her marriage itself, there is no necessity for the defendant No.2 [brother] to permit the plaintiff to retain the sale proceeds received by alleged sale of the property admeasuring Ac. 1.10 guntas,” said the Court.\nThe Court also rejected the argument that the intention of the appellant’s sister was only to claim properties owned by her brother by taking advantage of an unwritten partition. \nIt reasoned that the appellant in the written statement did not mention any oral or unwritten partition. \n“... In fact, he is pleading the Court to imagine that there was an oral partition between the parties by contending in the grounds of appeal that permitting the plaintiff to retain the sale proceeds of sale of Ac.1.10 guntas indicates that there was an understanding that plaintiff was given her share at the time of marriage,” it added. \nIt also considered the contention that the appellant’s mother in 2010 had executed a will deed which allegedly mentioned that her daughter was given her share at the time of her marriage in 1971.\nThe Court found it surprising that the suit in the matter was filed in 2009 and the appellant’s mother executed the alleged will deed in 2010, a year before she died.\nIt also noted that when the plaintiff and his mother filed a joint statement in response to the suit, there was no mention about the alleged will Deed.\nThe Court thus found the district judge’s ruling proper and dismissed the appeal as being devoid of any merits.\nAdvocate Muralidhar Reddy Katram represented the appellant brother.\nAdvocate M Saleem represented the respondent sister."}

In our opinion this complaint is before us due to complainant’s non-understanding of legal procedures, more so the rigmarole of the Bombay High Court; and he has a certain sense of entitlement for the money paid by him despite the efforts taken by the lawyer, which in our opinion does not constitute deficiency of service or unfair trade practice,” the 15-page order stated.\nThe complainant had engaged a lawyer, Taubon Irani, in 2009 for proceedings against his estranged wife regarding the custody of his children. \nHe informed the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission that Irani represented him in court proceedings between August 2009 to March 2012. However, Irani discontinued her services, unhappy with his conduct.\nThe complaint stated that Irani charged ₹65,000 for filing an appeal and two applications, which were dismissed due to some negligence by the lawyer. The complainant thus sought refund of the amount paid.\nIrani refuted the allegations, and pointed out that she had argued the appeal before a division bench of the High Court in February 2010 for over an hour. The Bench had then asked that the complainant's children be produced in court, so that they could be interviewed. He supposedly refused to comply with the order, after which the bench treated the hearing as null and void and did not pass any order.\nIrani also claimed that the complainant constantly hounded her with emails and calls. Simultaneously, due to some technical reasons, her name did not reflect on record of the appeal, which was dismissed. But Irani eventually got it restored. \nIrani pointed out that due to non-payment of her fees, and tired of the general misconduct of the client through his communication, she decided to discontinue her services to him.\nThe commission deduced from evidence that the lawyer’s conduct did not amount to deficiency of service or unfair trade practice and dismissed the complaint."}

They have also to live their life with this emotional trauma,\" the trial court added. \nTherefore, the judge rejected the plea made by the convict and his sister for leniency in punishment. \n\"When the loss and trauma suffered by the victim is compared with the mitigating circumstances and the 'chance' of rehabilitation of the convict, the tangible loss and life-long emotional trauma suffered by the victim by the horrible act committed by the convict far out-weighs any hypothetical chance of rehabilitation of the convict. Someone capable of holding such harmful and hateful mentality and the capability to willingly go through with it over a matter as trivial as envy and jealousy cannot be trusted to be reintegrated into the society. In such circumstances, the court is compelled to prioritize the sufferings of the victim as against the convict’s potential for change and need to take a resolute stance against the convict,\" the Court said. \nThe acid attack took place on February 1, 2022. The Court was told that the convict threw sulfuric acid on the survivor while she was returning home from her workplace. \nShe had to undergo 23 reconstructive surgeries so far for which around ₹48 lakh was already spent.\nThe attack took place after an engagement to marry between the convict and the survivor broke down. Before the attack, the convict had also threatened that he would disfigure the survivor's face if she did not marry him, the Court was told. \nIn view of this, the Court observed that the acid attack was planned and organised act by the convict.\nThe Court found the convict guilty of carrying out the acid attack on March 4 and pronounced his punishment on March 6.\nTo decide on the punishment, the Court also heard submissions made by the survivor, who narrated the hardships she was undergoing after the acid attack. She urged the Court to impose the maximum sentence on the convict so that no other girl in the society faces such trauma. \nThe survivor was also provided support by one Sehar Nazir, another acid attack survivor in whose case the same court had earlier awarded life imprisonment to two others.\nThe Court ultimately decided to reject the convict’s plea for leniency.\n“It has been argued by the counsel for the convict that the convict is young, a first offender so a lenient view may be taken while awarding sentence to him so that he is reformed and is brought back to the society. If this argument is accepted then what would happen to the victim,” the Court said.\nThe judge added that owing to the acid attack, the survivor has suffered facial disfigurement and has lost hopes of leading a normal life for no fault of her own.\nThe Court proceeded to sentence the convict to life in jail and ordered him to pay a fine of ₹40 lakh which has to be handed over to the survivor.\nThe Court also recommended the case to the Member Secretary, Jammu and Kashmir Legal Service Authority to award further compensation to the survivor in terms of the Jammu and Kashmir Victim Compensation Scheme, 2019.

Arunja Bewa and another.\nJustice Sanjay K Agrawal made the observation while acquitting a doctor in a case where the foetus of a deceased woman was found \"safe and dead\" in her womb at 24 weeks.\n\"Where the child in the womb is full grown the accused cannot be convicted of causing 'miscarriage' under Section 312 of the IPC. The reason is that this section only contemplates expulsion of the child from the mother’s womb before the period of gestation is completed. But in such cases, the accused could be convicted of an attempt to cause miscarriage under this section read with Section 511 of the IPC,\" the Court said in its January 16 order.\nThe deceased woman was said to have become pregnant after being in a relationship with a juvenile boy, with whom she had eloped.\nAfter nearly five months, the boy's family traced the couple only to find that the woman was pregnant. The family is then said to have given ₹ 1,500 to a doctor to terminate the woman's pregnancy.\nAccordingly, the doctor is alleged to have administered an injection to terminate the pregnancy. However, the woman died subsequently. \nHer postmortem reports stated that she had died of shock. \nSubsequently, a criminal case was filed against the doctor as well as the juvenile boy's family.\nTo decide on the case, the Court analysed Sections 312 (causing miscarriage) and 314 (death caused by act done with intent to cause miscarriage) of the IPC.\nAfter considering rival submissions, the High Court quashed the case against the accused. \n\"Foetus of 24 weeks was in the womb of the deceased though it was safe and dead and as such, there was no expulsion of child from the mother’s womb before the period of gestation is completed ... As such it is established on the date of offence that Shakun Bai (deceased woman) was having a foetus of 24 weeks in her womb and since there was no expulsion of the embryo or foetus, the act, it any, of the appellant would not come within the meaning of section 314 of the IPC to cause miscarriage. The prosecution has failed to prove that such an act has caused the death of Shakun Bai and that the appellant caused miscarriage with an intention to cause her death,\" the Court said.\nSince the prosecution failed to prove the offence of miscarriage, the Court also opined that there was no evidence against family members of the juvenile boy to abet the offence under Section 314. \nHence, it quashed and set aside their convictions too. \nAdvocate Gurmit Singh Ahluwalia appeared for the doctor. \nSenior Advocates Surendra Singh, KA Ansari along with advocates Pragalbha Sharma, Meera Ansari and Aman Ansari appeared for other accused persons. \nDeputy Government Advocate Sudeep Verma represented the State."}
{"ID": "id_1537", "Summary": "Being disciplined is an intrinsic part of the Armed Forces service and any leeway in this regard sends a wrong message, the Supreme Court stated on Friday. [Ex Sepoy Madan Prasad vs Union of India]\nA bench of Justices Hima Kohli and Rajesh Bindal observed that gross indiscipline by those serving in the forces cannot be tolerated.\nThe top court made the observation while upholding a mechanical transport driver's dismissal from army service for taking excess leaves without notice.\nThe Court found that the driver, a former sepoy, appeared to be a habitual offender and that he had remained out of line for far too long by seeking condonation of his leave. \n\"Such gross indiscipline on the part of the appellant who was a member of the Armed Forces could not be countenanced. He remained out of line far too often for seeking condonation of his absence of leave, this time, for a prolonged period of 108 days which if accepted, would have sent a wrong signal to others in service. One must be mindful of the fact that discipline is the implicit hallmark of the Armed Forces and a non-negotiable condition of service,\" the Court said. \nThe bench, therefore, upheld a February 2015 order passed by the Armed Forces Tribunal Lucknow Regional Bench dismissing the driver from service. \nThe tribunal had refused to interfere with two orders passed by a Court of Inquiry by which the driver was dismissed from service for overstaying the leave granted to him without sufficient cause. He had been charged under Section 39b of the Army Act.\nIn an appeal before the Supreme Court, the driver's counsel argued that the punishment was grossly disproportionate to the offence. \nThe counsel for the respondent-authorities, however, countered that the driver was a habitual offender who had pleaded guilty. Therefore, he cannot now be allowed to renege on the same by questioning the entire process, it was stressed.\nThe top court, at the outset, noted that the driver had not placed any document on record to justify his claim that he was absent because he had to tend to his ailing wife. \nRather, the Court found that the driver had only made a bald statement to such effect while making submissions before the Court of Inquiry in 1999.\nThe Court also observed that the punishment handed down was not graver than the one contemplated under the Army Act.\n\"The punishment of dismissal from service on conviction by Court Martial has been treated as a lesser punishment vis-à-vis the punishment of imprisonment for any period below 14 years ... sub-section (4) of Section 120 clearly states that a SCM can pass any sentence as contemplated under the Act,\" the Court noted.\nThe top court underscored that a summary court martial is empowered with sufficient discretion when it comes to imposing punishment for offences depending on the nature and gravity of the infraction. The Court, therefore, rejected the driver's contention that the punishment meted out to him was disproportionate. The appeal was, therefore, dismissed. \nIn a stern conclusion, the bench added that the former sepoy did not deserve any leniency for his conduct. \n\"The appellant had been taking too many liberties during his service and despite several punishments awarded to him earlier, ranging from imposition of fine to rigorous imprisonment, he did not mend his ways. This was his sixth infraction for the very same offence. Therefore, he did not deserve any leniency by infliction of a punishment lesser than that which has been awarded to him,\" the Court's judgment stated. \nAdvocate Shiv Kant Pandey appeared for the former sepoy, Madan Prasad.

Based on his report, the Special Investigation Team (SIT) probing the matter had concluded that the encounter was fake.\nIn a detailed judgement, the Court said that Verma has not denied that he spoke to the media without any permission or authorisation. \nThe Bench noted that Verma has also not denied the fact that he spoke about the Ishrat Jahan encounter and issues that were not within the sphere of his duties as Chief Vigilance Officer (CVO) of of the North Eastern Electric Power Corporation (NEEPCO). \n\"Clearly the interaction with the media was not in the Bonafide discharge of his duties as CVO NEEPCO. He also did not specify that the views expressed by him were his own and not that of the Government,\" the Court said. \nIt added that Verma's case does not fall within the category of cases where the findings returned by the Inquiry Authority are based on no evidence. \n\"Further, in view of the fact that the Petitioner has not been able to show any procedural irregularity or violation of the principles of natural justice and fair play, we do not find any reason to interfere with the findings returned by the Inquiry Authority or the order passed by the Disciplinary Authority,\" the Bench concluded. \nOn September 26, 2022 the Court had refused interim relief to Verma holding that at that stage, the order of termination did not warrant any interference as Verma was to superannuate on September 30.\n“Consequently, we are not inclined to stay or interdict the order of dismissal dated 30.08.2022 at this stage… It is clarified that in case petitioner is successful in the writ petition petitioner shall be entitled to all consequential benefits of his superannuation in accordance with rules,” the court had said.\nThe order was challenged in the Supreme Court. The apex court, while refusing to stay the order, asked the High Court to dispose of the case within three months. \nThe matter arises out of a departmental action initiated against Verma in 2016 for giving an interview to a TV channel. He was CVO of the NEEPCO and posted in Shillong. \nIt was Verma's case that he was only clarifying the accusations made against him by the CBI while probing the Ishrat Jahan case. \nHowever, the Government argued that Verma's statements in the interview had the effect of an adverse criticism of encounter and were capable of affecting the relationship of State of Gujarat and the Central goverment as well as India's relations with the neighbouring country. \nHe was charged with providing information into investigation in the Ishrat Jahan case and the information about interrogation of a senior officer in connection with the case. \nIt was further alleged that Verma gave out personal details of officials dealing with the case at the Ministry of Home Affairs and State levels and \"in-house procedures in dealing with sensitive case wherein foreign terrorists were involved which has the ramification to personal safety and issues relating to national security.\"\nSenior Advocate IH Syed with advocates Rahul Sharma and Suroor Mander appeared for Satish Chandra Verma. \nSenior Advocate Arun Bhardwaj, Central Government Standing Counsel (CGSC) Harish Vaidyanathan Shankar and advocates Abhishek Sharma, Gauraan, Nishant Bahuguna, Srish Kumar Mishra, Sagar Mehlawat, Alexander Mathai Paikaday appeared for the Central government. \nAdvocate Kumar Parima appeared for NEEPCO. \nSenior Advocate Manisha Lav Kumar and Advocate Ravi Kant Jain appeared for the State of Gujarat."}

Taking a narrow view as to what acts could constitute an obscenity would be a retrograde act, on our part.

{"ID": "id_1540", "Summary": "The Calcutta High Court on Tuesday criticised the West Bengal Police for trying to shield Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader Shahjahan Sheikh even as he evaded arrest for his role in the recent attack on Enforcement Directorate (ED) officers [Enforcement Directorate v. State of West Bengal]. \nA Bench of Chief Justice TS Sivagnanam and Justice Hiranmay Bhattacharyya said that despite a clear order restraining the West Bengal Police from proceeding with the investigation into the attacks, it transferred the first information report (FIR) in the case to the local CID. \n\"Thus, this act of the State Police would be sufficient to hold that it is totally biased and every attempt is being made to delay the probe in order to protect the accused (Sheikh), who has been absconding for more than 50 days. The then absconding accused is stated to be a “strong man” in the locality and has very powerful connections in the ruling party...The State Police had played a hide and seek methodology in all probabilities to shield the accused, who undoubtedly is highly political influential person, who has demonstrable shown that he is and would be in a position to influence the probe if allowed to rest with the State Police,\" the judgment said.\nThe Court today transferred the investigation into allegations that Sheikh and his aides attacked ED officers who had come for a raid, to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). The ED was investigating Sheikh's involvement in a multi-crore ration distribution scam. In this light, the Court said,\n\"Thus, what is required is a fair, honest and complete probe and thus alone will retain the public confidence in the impartial working of the State agencies. We have no hesitation in our mind to hold that this confidence has been shaken and there can be no better case than the case on hand which requires to be transferred to the CBI.\"\nThe Bench noted several flaws in the FIR registered suo motu by the local police. It said that several provisions of the IPC were not invoked against persons affiliated with Sheikh, who attacked the officers with bricks and stones. It went on to say,\n\"It is beyond one’s comprehension that without a pre-planned effort more than thousand people or three thousand people...could have assembled in that area armed with deadly weapons to attack the ED officials and CRPF.\"\nThe Court also agreed with the submission of the ED that the attack on its officers was underplayed by the West Bengal Police.\nGiven the clout of Sheikh and in order to do complete justice, the Court found it fit to transfer the probe to the CBI.  \nAdvocate General Kishore Dutta along with Advocate Pantu Deb Roy appeared for the West Bengal Police. \nAdditional Solicitor General SV Raju and Deputy Solicitor General Dhiraj Trivedi along with Advocates Samrat Goswami, Ankit Khanna, Swapna Jha and Sohini Dey represented the ED. \nAdditional Solicitor General Ashok Kr Chakraborty along with Advocate TP Acharyya represented the Union of India. \nOn January 5 this year, around 200 locals are said to have surrounded and gheraoed ED officers who had arrived to raid Sheikh residence at Akunjipara to question him in relation to the ration scam case.\nED officers were injured during the ensuing clash. In the wake of this incident, the Governor of West Bengal CV Ananda Bose later called for the arrest of Sheikh.\nSheikh was absconding for over 55 days, until his eventual arrest on February 29."}

{"ID": "id_1543", "Summary": "The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the Delhi Assembly's powers to constitute committee to examine Delhi Riots of 2020 since it is social issue but ruled that the committee so constituted cannot act like a prosecuting agency (Ajit Mohan v. Legislative Assembly, National Capital Territory of Delhi). \nThe Court, therefore, held that the petition filed by Facebook India Head Ajit Mohan challenging the notices issued by the Delhi Assembly's Peace and Harmony Committee seeking Mohan's presence before it as part of its inquiry into riots, was premature as nothing has happened before the committee.\nA Bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul, Dinesh Maheshwari and Hrishikesh Roy agreed with the submission of Delhi Assembly that no coercive action has been taken against Mohan and the notice issued to him was to seek his assistance in examining a social problem.\n\"We agree with Dr Singhvi's contention that no coercive action has been taken against Mr Mohan,\" the Court noted. \nThe Court said that Delhi Assembly can look into the Delhi Riots even though law and order does not fall within the domain of Delhi government. \n\"The Assembly admittedly does not have the power to legislate under the issues which fall under the domain of union govt. However objective of peace and harmony go beyond law and order and police,\" the Court said. \nThe Delhi Assembly, the top court opined, is not different from any other State assembly in the country except with respect to certain subjects as under list 2 of 7th schedule.\n\"Investigation of a socially complicated problem too is under its domain,\" the Court said.\nHowever, in doing so, the committee cannot don the role of a prosecuting agency and direct filing of supplementary chargesheet etc, the Court made it clear. \nTherefore, any representative of the Facebook India can deny answering any question by the committee if it falls within the prohibited domains, the Court said. \nIn this regard, the Court also took exception to the press conference held by the Delhi government in which Facebook's alleged role in the riots was castigated by the Delhi government. \n\"The statements made in the press conference by respondents were hardly conducive to the proceedings before the committee. It was said Facebook with vested interest in Delhi riots.... these statements should not have been made and can give rise to apprehension in mind of petitioner,\" the Court said. \nThe Court in its judgment also noted the impact of social media websites and the difficulty in regulating the content on such sites. \n\"Technological age has created digital platforms which can be uncontrolled at times. One such creation is of intermediaries which states that they have no control over the content posts. Less informed individuals may not verify information from leaders and take it as gospel truth,\" the Court observed. \nIn his plea, Mohan had argued that the Delhi Assembly's Committee does not have the authority to compel him to appear before it, since the same issue was already before a parliamentary panel.\nMohan had submitted that he already appeared before a Parliamentary Standing Committee in this regard.\nSenior counsel Harish Salve, representing Facebook, had told the Court during the hearing of the case that the proceedings before the committee are outside the scope of jurisdiction of the Delhi assembly and that Facebook is regulated by central law – the Information Technology Act (IT Act).\n“I am not willing to go before them. Allegations are being made that Facebook has created disharmony in Delhi. Facebook does not write anything. It provides a platform. We are regulated by a central law – the IT Act,” Salve said.\nIn this regard, Facebook referred to Article 239AA(3)(a) as per which Delhi Assembly does not have power to deal with entries 1 and 2 of the State list which relates to public order and police.\nSalve also said that Facebook chose to appear before the Union Ministry of Information Technology as a commercial necessity, since they are empowered to shut down Facebook. However, since the Committee constituted by the Delhi Assembly has no such powers, Facebook decided not to appear before it.\n\"I don't run Facebook, it is run by the Valley (Silicon Valley, USA). You are trying to hold an inquisition against Facebook. We go to Ministry of Information Technology because its a commercial necessity and they can shut us down. But Delhi committee cannot, we choose not to appear before them,\" Salve submitted.\nThe Central government had also thrown its weight behind Facebook stating that Delhi assembly’s action in holding such an inquiry is without jurisdiction.\n“Public order and police are not under Delhi assembly and their action is without jurisdiction,” Solicitor General Tushar Mehta who was representing the central government submitted.\nSalve also submitted that Facebook India cannot be compelled to speak before the Peace and Harmony Committee and that the top Court should uphold the right to silence.\n\"The right to silence is a very valuable right in today's day and age... please protect this right and leave it to me to decide whether or not I want to go. Lay down that this summons is an invitation and no more,\" Salve argued.\nDuring the course of his submissions, Salve had contended that the Delhi Assembly's issue is less to do with Facebook and more to do with its differences with the ruling Central Government.\nOn the other hand, Delhi Legislative Assembly and the Committee had told the Supreme Court that Facebook, being a corporation, has no locus to approach the Supreme Court under Article 32 of the Constitution challenging the notice issued to them by the Delhi Assembly’s Peace and Harmony Committee and that is why they filed the petition through their India Head, Ajit Mohan.\nSenior Advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, representing the committee had submitted that Facebook got its India Head Ajit Mohan to file the petition to overcome the legal hurdle Facebook faced in filing a petition under Article 32.\n“Article 32 right is not available to corporations and I would also say to people who represent those corporations. So in order to avail Article 32 remedy, they got Ajit Mohan. So the veil on Ajit Mohan has to be lifted. He is not a shareholder. It is a symbiotic relationship between him and Facebook. So the petitioner before Your Lordships is Facebook and not Ajit Mohan. He (Ajit Mohan) is a sham petitioner,” Senior Advocate Rajeev Dhavan had argued echoing Singhvi's submissions.\nThe Delhi Assembly, on the other hand, maintained that Mohan was certainly summoned albeit only as an expert witness. There was no coercive action to be taken against him.\nSenior Advocates Dr Abhishek Manu Singhvi and Prashanto Sen appeared for the Delhi Legislative Assembly. Senior Advocate Rajeev Dhavan appeared for the Delhi's Peace and Harmony Committee. Senior Advocate Harish Salve appeared for Facebook.

Suffice to say that freedom of speech is a fundamental right and makes a foundation for a strong democracy\", stated the order\nThe petitioner had been arrested following the registration of two FIRs. The first FIR cited Sections 124A (sedition) and 153A (promoting enmity between different groups) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the second one cited Sections 294 (obscene acts and songs), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace), 506 (criminal intimidation), and 500 (defamation) of the IPC.\nAs per the FIRs, the petitioner had allegedly made certain speeches regarding the Chief Minister of Haryana that had objectionable content and could have resulted in caste-based division, leading to a disruption in the State's peace and harmony.\nThe State opposed bail, contending that the petitioner had been arrested with great difficulty and may attempt to abscond if released. Another concern expressed was that petitioner may create a law-and-order problem through his activities if he is enlarged on bail.\nOn the other hand, the petitioner's counsel argued that the case was one of false implication and the petitioner was simply exercising his fundamental right to protest.

Thus, he moved the High Court for release of the amount.\nThe prayer was accepted since the state counsel did not oppose the claim, and the CJM was directed to release the amount.\nHowever, despite the High Court’s direction, the CJM declined the prayer.\nThe State counsel pointed out that though the Court’s direction was specific, the trial court refused the prayer considering complainant's appeal against the judgment of acquittal.\nHowever, even the State conceded that the condition imposed while granting pre-arrest bail would come to an end on acquittal as their bail bonds and surety bonds stood discharged.\nOn hearing the background of the case, the High Court called for an explanation from the CJM noting that, “the order (declining release of amount) was passed in flagrant violation of clear and unambiguous direction issued by this Court on November 6, 2020.”\nIt was Justice Bajaj’s take that the explanation reflected that the CJM was honoured to receive the show-cause notice and attempted to explain that he mistakenly refused to refund the amount and regretted inconvenience caused to the High Court.\n“The expression and reasoning contained in the impugned order do not show that the disobedience of the direction by this Court was erroneous as claimed in the explanation, therefore, the same is not worth acceptance,” the single-judge said.\nThe High Court opined that the accused was within his rights to claim a refund. Further, it was stated that the direction of the High Court was “crystal clear\" and did not require interpretation, much less by the Chief Judicial Magistrate.\nIn fact, on perusal of the order under challenge, the High Court noted that the CJM needlessly proceeded to interpret the order without any jurisdiction, and the reasoning given was patently absurd and illogical.\nThus, the Court set aside the order of the CJM and directed the amount to be refunded to the petitioner.\nThe Court also directed that a copy of its order be sent to the Chief Justice of the High Court for initiating departmental action against the CJM. \n\"Let a copy of this order be sent to Hon'ble the Chief Justice for initiating departmental action against Mr. Arvind Kumar, Chief Judicial Magistrate, Yamuna Nagar at Jagadhari,\" the High Court ordered.\nAdvocate SS Dinarpur appeared for the petitioner and the State was represented by Deputy Advocate-General Bhupender Singh."}

Consortium of National Law Universities)\nThe judgment was passed by a Single Judge Bench of Justice Jayant Nath in the petition preferred by one CLAT aspirant, V Govinda Ramanan (Petitioner).\nThe Petitioner was a law graduate who wished to pursue his LL.M.\nIt was his concern that since he suffered from asthma and thus fell under the vulnerable category of individuals, he ought not to be made to appear for a centre-based examination amid the pandemic.\nThe Petitioner argued that the centre-based test was in violation of his ‘Right to Life’ and ‘Right to Health’ guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. \nIt was contended that the movements of the individuals under the risk category, i.e. elderly, children and other individuals who are suffering from ailments continued to be restricted by the Central Government. \nThe Petitioner thus prayed for an appropriate direction to quash the CLAT- 2020 examination notification in so far as it mandated him to physically go to the examination centre and give the exam. \nIn response to the petition, the Consortium of National Law Universities submitted that a home-based online test for around 78,000 students was not possible as it would be completely compromised and may even be manipulated by the participants or coaching centres. \nThe Consortium informed the Court that similar petitions against centre-based examinations had been rejected by the Supreme Court for various other entrance tests, including CLAT-2020. \nIt was further submitted that the Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India, had on July 6, 2020 issued instructions permitting the conduct of examinations at physical test centres for final term examinations for Universities, IIT-JEE, NEET, CLAT etc. \nThe Consortium assured the Court that CLAT 2020 would be conducted in the safest manner possible and that for places which have restriction on movement, the admit/identity cards issued to the candidates would be treated as a pass for the movement of students.\nIt was also submitted that a home-based online test would severely harm those candidates from the backward areas/sections who lack technological resources. \nIn view of the submissions made by the parties, the Court opined that the possibility of the test being compromised or manipulated by the participants/coaching centers could not be ruled out.\n\"That apart, the problem of accessibility for 78,000 candidates to appropriate technology, internet connection, laptop or desktop computer itself would be doubtful.\", the Court added. \nThe Court also clarified that Ministry of Home Affairs guidelines asking persons with co-morbidities to stay at home was \"at best an advisory\".\nUltimately, in view of the above, along with exemption granted to educational institutions for holding examinations and the Supreme Court order dismissing a similar prayer, the Court held, \nThe petition was accordingly dismissed. \nAdvocates Yudhvir Singh Chauhan, Vishal Dabas appeared for the Petitioner. \nThe Consortium was represented by Senior Advocate Dayan Krishnan and Advocate Vinayak Mehrotra.\nRead the Order:\nDelhi HC dismisses plea challenging conduct of CLAT 2020 as a centre-based online test #CLAT #CLAT2020 https://t.co/sRfBgT5ztk"}
{"ID": "id_1552", "Summary": "The Kerala High Court recently held that when trial courts are dealing with a case and a counter-case, they should avoid taking short cuts by dismissing the counter-case on flimsy grounds, through non-speaking orders [Amir & Anr. v State of Kerala].\nJustice PV Kunhikrishnan opined that while a court is not required to go deep into the merits of case at the stage of framing charge under Section 227 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), it is desirable for the same judge to hear the cases together at the stage of framing charge and passes orders on the same day.\n\"But when a Sessions court tries a case and counter case, the trial court cannot take such flimsy stand to discharge the accused in the counter case and thereafter proceed with the main case....It will only defeat the procedure laid down by this Court and the Apex Court on the trial of the case and counter case....short cut methods should be avoided by the trial courts while dealing with case and counter cases. The reason to prescribe such a procedure by this Court and the Apex Court in case and counter case is to avoid conflicting decisions,\" the High Court held. \nOn the procedure to be followed while trying a case and counter-case, the Court said both trials should be conducted one after the other, and speaking orders should be passed in both even if one is a discharge order.\n\"It is desirable to pass a speaking order while framing charge in the main case separately while passing the discharge order in other case. Suppose the counter case is discharged by a presiding officer and thereafter he was transferred or retired from service after superannuation, the successor judge will have to decide the main case. At that stage there is a chance for a conflicting decision also,\" the Court said in its judgment.\nThe Court was dealing with an appeal against an order of a trial court finding the appellant guilty and sentencing him for committing offences punishable under Sections 341(wrongful restraint) and 307 (attempt to murder) read with Section 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code.\nThe prosecution case was that the appellant, along with another accused had verbally abused and later, attacked a man with a knife. \nThe appellant had also registered a counter-case against the injured but the trial judge discharged him.\nSubsequently, the trial judge heard the original case against the appellant and issued a separate judgment.\nAdvocates B Renjith Marar and Arun Poomulli, appearing for the appellant, contended that the trial judge had not followed the correct procedure to be adhered to when cases and counter cases are considered. \nIt was also argued that the offence under Section 34 wasn't fully established by the prosecution and that the right to private defense cannot be ruled out. \nOn the point regarding the procedure to be followed when there is a case and counter-case, the Court found that the trial court had adopted a short cut method by discharging the accused in counter case and proceeding with the main case, defeating the principle laid down by the High Court as well as the Supreme Court in a catena of decisions. \nMoreover, the Court noticed that the main ground for discharging the accused in the counter-case was the delay in filing the same, which the Court termed as \"flimsy\"\nHowever, since the appeal did not challenge the discharge order of the trial court, the Court let the matter rest.\nAs far as the offences alleged, upon considering the facts and circumstances of the case, the Court set aside the conviction under Sections 307 and 34 of the IPC. The conviction under Section 341 was upheld but the corresponding sentence was modified."}

They lived happily for some time but things turned sour gradually. The husband alleged that the wife insisted to live separately and not with her in-laws. However, when the husband refused to accede to her request, she often picked up quarrels. \nThe husband further claimed that in June 2009 the wife left the matrimonial house voluntarily and returned only in December 2009. She again left the matrimonial house without any cause. \nHe alleged that after the death of his mother in 2012 and father in 2015, when he requested her to return to the matrimonial house, she refused to come back.\nOn the other hand, the wife contended that she and her husband lived happily only for five years after their marriage. However, when she insisted the husband to take her along to the place of his posting and let her live with him there, he refused to do so. She alleged that since 2010, he started neglecting her and therefore, she left the matrimonial house.\nHaving heard the contentions, the bench noted that the husband himself had refused to allow his wife to reside with him at the place of his posting and he has not stated any reason in the petition or in his deposition for his unwillingness to keep his wife with him at the place of his posting. \n\"When the conduct of the husband was at fault in not allowing his wife to reside with him and in such compelling circumstances, if the wife is living separately at her parental house and the husband has also not made any effort or called any social meeting and not taken any steps for filing any application for restitution of conjugal rights, mere assertion in the plaint that the wife is residing separately since December 2009 for any sufficient cause, is not found to be proved,\" the bench said in the order passed on September 25.\nThe bench, therefore, dismissed the appeal and also directed the husband to pay interim maintenance of ₹15,000 to the wife.\nAdvocate Ritesh Giri appeared for the Husband.\nAdvocate Nirupama Bajpai represented the Wife."}

{"ID": "id_1556", "Summary": "The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay High Court recently held that even if a wife makes false social media posts regarding her employment, she cannot be denied interim maintenance [Aboli Patil vs Tejpal Patil].\nSingle-Judge Justice Sandeep Marne while ordering the husband to pay interim maintenance of ₹ 7,500, noted that the wife had made certain posts on Facebook, stating to have received a job in London, however, she later on claimed it to be a fake offer.\n\"No doubt, the act of the wife in posting the letter of appointment, which she later claims to be fake, on social media is not commendable and she should have restrained herself from doing so without first verifying the genuineness of the offer,\" the judge observed.\nThe bench further said that at this stage it would be difficult to ascertain if she was actually deceived or was merely attempting to garner praise and popularity on social media platforms by posting factually incorrect information. \n\"In absence of any concrete proof of actual employment, an inference cannot be drawn that the offer actually fructified in a job for her. Having arrived at a conclusion the wife is actually not employed, in my view, the doors of the Courts cannot be shut on her, even if her conduct may not be completely free from blemish,\" the judge said in the order pronounced on November 23.\nThe bench was hearing the wife's plea challenging an order passed by a Family Court in Jalna on December 4, 2019, by which her plea for interim maintenance was rejected on two counts: that she possesses higher qualifications and that on her social media status, she had declared that she had secured a job in a company at London.\nThe husband highlighted the fact that his wife possesses a Master's degree in Engineering, thus, having the ability and capability to earn and yet if she sits idle, she cannot be awarded maintenance. He even pointed out that the wife's mother was politically connected and that the wife herself had accepted some political position.\nThe bench, however, held that the political connection of the mother is irrelevant in the matter. It also noted that the husband failed to place any material to show that the wife has accepted some position in politics.\nFurther, the bench noted that the Family Court while denying interim maintenance to the wife, presumed that given her qualification, she could secure a job. \n\"This finding in my opinion appears to be totally erroneous. The Family Court itself has recorded a finding that mere publication of a post on social media platform is not sufficient to make out a case with regard to the employment of the wife. Having held so, the Family Court ought not to have raised a presumption she secured an employment, just because she possesses higher qualifications,\" the judge opined.\nReferring to various judgments of the Supreme Court on this very issue, the bench reiterated that mere possession of qualifications by wife who is admittedly not employed, cannot ipso facto be a reason to deny interim maintenance altogether.\nThe judge, further, noted that the husband earned around ₹66,000 per month and also has a loan to be repaid.\nTherefore, the Court ordered him to pay ₹7,500 as interim maintenance to the wife given the fact that she is presently unemployed but possesses higher qualifications, on which basis she can secure a decent job.\nAdvocate SV Deshmukh appeared for the Wife.\nAdvocate AA Nimbalkar represented the Husband."}

{"ID": "id_1559", "Summary": "The Himachal Pradesh High Court on Tuesday refused to recall its order for removal of India Police Service (IPS) officer Sanjay Kundu from the post of Director General of Police (DGP) of Himachal Pradesh [Court On Its Own Motion v. State of Himachal Pradesh and Others].\nThe High Court order for Kundu’s removal had last week been stayed by the Supreme Court till the decision on his recall application. The application was heard by the High Court for almost the whole day on January 5.\nThe division bench of Chief Justice MS Ramachandra Rao and Justice Jyotsna Rewal Dua in the order passed on Wednesday rejected Kundu’s application, saying no case has been made out by him for recall of the order dated December 26.\n“Should this Court, under the pretext of protecting the reputation of the officers concerned, forget its constitutional responsibility of ensuring fair investigation in the matter?,” asked the Court.\nInterestingly, the State Advocate General Anup Rattan had opposed Kundu’s application for recall of the order to remove him from the DGP post.\nOn December 26, the High Court had ordered the State government to move the DGP and Superintendent of Police (SP), Kangra, to other posts to ensure fair investigation into a businessman’s allegations of alleged threats to him and his family in connection with a business dispute\nThe threats were allegedly coming from a retired IPS officer and a senior lawyer. The Court was told that the complainant was getting constant phone calls from the DGP’s office in connection with the dispute. \nOn the basis of the reports submitted by Superintendent of Police of Shimla, the High Court in its December 26 order recorded that the DGP had been in touch with the business partner of the complainant and had repeatedly tried to contact the latter.\nKundu then moved the Supreme Court which on January 3 granted an interim stay on the High Court order and said that the December 26 order should not be given effect to until the High Court decides the recall application. \nDuring the hearing of the recall application, Kundu’s counsel Senior Advocate Sanjay Jain submitted that the DGP had looked into the issue “in good faith and motivated by principles of police led mediation” after his old acquaintance Senior Advocate KD Shreedhar had told him about the business dispute.  \nThe complainant Nishant Sharma told the Court that Shreedhar and his brother through the DGP were trying to force him to sell his and his father’s shares in a private company.\nAt this stage, the Court clarified that it would be difficult for it to state which version is correct. \nHowever, it observed that  courts in the country have repeatedly laid down that the police officers cannot interfere in civil disputes. \n“How a Senior Police Officer like Shri Sanjay Kundu, who ought to be aware of the legal position that his interference in a civil dispute between shareholders of a private company is highly improper, thought he should intervene and mediate between KD Shreedhar and Nishant Sharma (with whom he had no prior acquaintance) and settle their disputes, we are unable to comprehend. This conduct cannot be said to be within his line of duty prima facie.”\nThe Court also noted that Shreedhar is a senior lawyer and not a poor man suffering any disadvantage. \nHe can certainly avail remedies available to him at law to resolve his disputes with Sharma and his father and does not need Kundu’s intervention, it added.\n“At request of such a person, the attempt of Shri Sanjay Kundu, IPS to attempt to settle the dispute seems to be a colourable exercise of his power and authority prima facie,” the Court opined.\nThe Court further said that continued interaction between Kundu and Shreedhar for over three months suggests more than a mere acquaintance and possibly longer association or friendship.\nTaking note of the circumstances that there was constant communication between Kundu and Shreedhar and Kundu had persistently attempted to call the complainant and placed his hotel under surveillance, the Court said,\n“In view of the above undisputed facts, this Court had no choice but to pass the order dt.26.12.2023 since the State Government did nothing in the matter.”\nMeanwhile, the Court also refused to recall the order for removal of SP Kangra, Shalini Agnihotri. \nOn Kundu and Agnihotri’s demand for probe by Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in the case, the Court agreed with the submissions made by AG and Amicus Curiae that the case does not fall in the category of cases which require the central agency's probe.\nThe Court directed the State government to ensure effective protection to the complainant and his family under further orders. \nIt also asked the State to consider forming a Special Investigation Team consisting of Inspector General-level officers to coordinate the investigation in the criminal cases related to the matter.\nThe Court will hear the case on February 28.\nSenior Advocate Neeraj Gupta and advocate Vedhant Ranta appeared as amicus curiae.\nAdvocate General Anup Rattan with Additional Advocate Generals Rakesh Dhaulta and Pranay Pratap and Deputy Advocate Generals Sidharth Jalta and Arsh Rattan represented the State.\nSenior Advocate Sanjay Jain and advocates Arjun Lall, Aakash Thakur and Aakarsh Mishra represented DGP Sanjay Kundu.\nSenior Advocate Shrawan Dogra along with advocate Tejasvi Dogra represented SP Shalini Agnihotri."}

Much indeed, as this litigation would disclose,” the Court said.\nThe single-judge said that Section 35 of the Trade Marks Act cannot be interpreted in such a manner as to prohibit a person from using his own name for his goods. \nSection 35 provides that a proprietor or a registered user of a trade mark cannot interfere with any bona fide use by a person of his own name for his business.\nAny interpretation of Section 35 of Trade Marks Act prohibiting the use of a person of his own name for his goods would be “reading a non-existent proviso into Section 35 and, in effect, rewriting the provision”, the Court opined. \n“The proscription under Section 35 is absolute, and would extend to infringement as well as passing off actions. The restraint against interference with the bona fide use, by a person, of his own name, is not dependent on whether the action is one for infringement or passing off,” the Court said.\nThe Court returned these findings while rejecting an interim injunction application filed by Jindal Industries Private Limited against a company by the name of Suncity Sheets Private Limited.\nJindal moved the Court to restrain the defendant (Suncity) from using composite mark “RN Jindal SS Tubes” or JINDAL per se in any manner as it infringes on Jindal’s registered trademarks.\nThe owners of the Suncity were named Rachna Jindal and Nitin Kumar Jindal.\nThe Court considered the case and held that one who obtains registration of a common name or surname like JINDAL as a trade mark does so with all the risks that such registration entails and there is always a possibility of there being several such 'Jindals.'\n“It is open to anyone, and everyone, to use his name on his goods, and, therefore, the possibility of there being several JINDAL’s looms large. The plaintiff cannot, by obtaining registration for JINDAL as a word mark, monopolize the use of JINDAL even as a part – and not a very significant one at that – of any and every mark, even in the context of steel, or SS pipes and tubes. The Trade Marks Act, and the privileges it confers, cannot be extended to the point where one can monopolize the use of a common name for goods, and, by registering it, foreclose the rest of humanity from using it,” the Court said. \nJustice Hari Shankar concluded there is no likelihood of confusion between the products of the two companies and no case for passing off is made out.\n“No one, much less a consumer of average intelligence, who reads the text on the defendants’ impugned mark, would regard it is a mark of the plaintiff. The defendants’ impugned mark is clearly a source identifier, and identifies the product, on which it is used, with the defendants, and with no one else,” the Court said. \nThe interim injunction application was, therefore, dismissed.\nSenior Advocate Chander M Lall along with advocates Sarad Kumar Sunny, Rohan Dua, Keshav Mann and Yashi Dubey appeared for Jindal Industries.\nSuncity was represented by advocates Vaibhav Agnihotri and Harshit Kiran.\nAdvocates J Sai Deepak, Kishore Kunal, Abhishek Avadhani and Runjhun Pare represented Rachna Jindal (owner of the Suncity)."}
{"ID": "id_1562", "Summary": "The Madras High Court Wednesday said that persons who were living temporarily in India and foreign citizens who are Overseas Citizenship of India (OCI) cardholders are entitled to invoke the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act of 2005 (DV Act) before Indian courts. \nJustice SM Subramaniam of the Madras High Court further said that there is no bar on an American citizen holding an OCI card from approaching an appropriate court of law in India for alleged abuse and domestic violence that might have taken place in America.\nThe Court said that the DV Act is a welfare legislation and, therefore, a woman, residing in India could not be denied access to its provisions. \nIt also said that since the woman in the present case was residing in India now, the cause of action arose in India.  \n\"Section 27 (of the DV Act) unambiguously stipulates that an aggrieved person temporarily residing or carrying out business or employed is also falling within the ambit of the Domestic Violence Act. Therefore, a person, who is temporarily residing in India or a Overseas Citizen of India, if abused economically by the spouse, who is residing in another country, is entitled to seek relief under the Act. The cause of action arises in India since the aggrieved person is residing in India,\" Justice Subramaniam said. \nThe Court was hearing a revision petition filed by an American citizen, seeking that the DV Act proceedings initiated by his estranged wife before a Mahila Court in Chennai be quashed. \nThe husband told the Court that the woman, an OCI card holder, and their twin sons had come to India last year in the pretext of a short visit to Chennai, but had stayed back in India, never to return to USA. \nHe also said that during this period, an American court had granted an ex parte divorce decree and had granted him the custody of the twin boys. He, therefore, argued that all connected proceedings that the woman had initiated in India cannot be sustained. \nIt was also pointed out that he had filed a habeas corpus petition before the Madras High Court last year and the High Court in January this year, had said that the boys should go back to America and live with their father. He argued that in view of such order, the single-judge cannot re- examine the boys. \nThe woman, however, argued that she was a victim of physical and emotional abuse at the hands of her estranged husband and she had no intention of returning to America.\nThe twin boys, who are 15 years old, also told the Court that they wished to stay with their mother in India. \nThe High Court then said that the foreign court's order will not act as a bar on statutory courts in India to adjudicate over the woman's pleas.  \nJustice Subramaniam said that merely because a foreign court had taken a particular view on an aspect concerning the welfare of the minors, courts in India do not need to \"shut out an independent consideration of the matter.\" \n\"Objectivity and not abject surrender is the mantra in such cases. Judicial pronouncements on the subject are not on virgin ground. Since no system of private international law exists that can claim universal recognition on this issue, Indian courts have to decide the issue regarding the validity of the decree in accordance with the Indian law. Comity of courts simply demands consideration of any such order issued by foreign courts and not necessarily their enforcement,\" the High Court said. \nThe Hindu Marriage Act and Domestic Violence Act are the welfare legislations for women, the Court underscored.\n\"The rights of the parties to get reliefs under the Special Enactments / Personnel Laws need not be denied by the Courts. The Hindu Marriage Act and Domestic Violence Act are the welfare legislations for women and therefore, the respondent / wife need not be deprived off from getting reliefs under the Acts, for which, she is entitled. In the present case, the respondent and the twin children aged about 15 years are residing at Chennai for more than two years and raising several allegations against the revision petitioner / husband and more so, the respondent alleges that they are being harassed by the revision petitioner, who is not maintaining the children as of now and further, economic abuse is also alleged. The nature and scope of Habeas Corpus Petition is incomparable with the proceedings under the Hindu Marriage Act and Domestic Violence Act. Thus, right to seek relief under the Special Enactments by the aggrieved woman shall not be taken away and in the event of preventing the woman, the same would result in infringement of her basic rights under the Constitution and the Special Enactments,\" the HighCourt said. \nThe Court also said that its \"conscience\" could not permit it to forcibly send the two boys to America.

State of Maharashtra].\nA Division Bench of Justices Vibha Kankanwadi and Abhay Waghwase observed the same while granting anticipatory bail to a Muslim woman, her parents and her sister, who were booked for allegedly forcing a Hindu man to convert to Islam and marry the woman.\n\"It appears that now the colour has been tried to be given of love-jihad, but when love is accepted then there is less possibility of the person being trapped just for converting him into the other’s religion...Merely because the boy and girl are from different religion, it cannot have a religions (sic) angle. It can be a case of pure love for each other,\" the Bench observed in its judgment.\nThe Court was hearing an application filed by the woman and her family, who were denied anticipatory bail by a special court in Aurangabad. \nThe man accused the woman and her family of forcing him to convert to Islam. He even alleged that a forceful circumcision (Khatana) was also performed on him. Further, it was contended that the case had a \"love jihad\" angle, as he was forced to make some monetary transactions in favour of the woman's family. Another claim made was that he was abused in the name of his caste.\nThe Bench, however, noted that as per the first information report (FIR), the man himself admitted that he had a love affair with the woman.\nAs per the prosecution case, the man and the woman were in a relationship since March 2018. The man belonged to the Scheduled Caste community, but did not disclose the same to the woman.\nLater, the woman began insisting that he convert to Islam and marry her, after which the man disclosed his caste identity to the woman's parents. They did not raise any objection to the same, and also convinced her daughter to accept it.\n\"That means he has posed, prima facie a good relationship between him and her parents at that point of time. When the initial relationship was good and the caste or the religion was not the barrier for them, then the question of raising the issue of caste or community or religion at a later point of time will not arise,\" the Court noted.\nSubsequently, the relationship turned sour. \nThe Bench took note of the other allegations raised by the man in his complaint, such as his alleged abduction and forcible circumcision in March 2021, the demand to convert him to Islam, the woman's financial demands, the rape case filed against him etc. \nThe Court said that despite all such instances, the man did not sever his relations with the accused woman. It was also noted that the FIR was filed only in December 2022. \nThis, the Bench said, was surprising.\n\"We can see that there is an inordinate delay in lodging the FIR. When there is inordinate delay, it affects the story and may loose its importance. The fact will have to be observed that when the base for the relationship was the love affair, there was no barrier of caste or religion and therefore, prima facie case under the Atrocities Act cannot be said to be made out,\" the judgment stated.\nNotably, the special court had premised its orders on the fact that charges under the stringent Scheduled Caste Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act were invoked against the woman and her family. \nIt noted that a settlement deed was also signed between the two to amicably settle the dispute. Though the man's advocate disputed the settlement, the Bench noted that the same was duly notarized and thus would be considered.\n\"We are of the opinion that prima facie offence under the Atrocities Act are not made out and therefore, there was no bar under Section 18 or 18-A of the Atrocities Act. Thus, the conclusion drawn by the Special Judge in that respect is wrong.\"\nMoreover, the Court noted that the probe in the case was almost complete, and that the police was likely to file a chargesheet soon.\nThus, the physical custody of the applicants would not be necessary for the purpose of investigation, the Court added.\nAs far as the claim of the man that he was forcefully circumcised, the Bench noted that an expert was asked to comment on the same by the police. \n\"However, the expert was unable to say as to whether the circumcision was natural or was due to any surgical intervention. The expert was also unable to say as to whether it was done by any medical professional or in a traditional way of Islam by an unauthorized person. He was also unable to say as to when it would have been done,\" the judgment said. \nIn view of the above, the bench granted anticipatory bail to the woman and her family members. \nSenior Advocate VD Sapkal along with Advocate Patel Khizer appeared for the applicants.\nAdditional Public Prosecutor SD Ghayal represented the State.\nAdvocates Swapnil Joshi and SB Deshpande represented the complainant."}

They argued that the case registered against them was false and designed to quell protests against the State government. \nThe Additional Magistrate, upon going through the evidence rendered by the prosecution witnesses, noted that there were some contradictions, and that they were unable to mention the specific acts of the accused or place of occurrence.\nFurther the prosecution failed to produce the investigating officer as a witness which the Additional Magistrate opined was fatal to the prosecution. \nAfter going through a host of precedents of the Kerala High Court on the essential ingredients to establish an unlawful assembly, the Additional Magistrate concluded that there was absolutely no evidence to prove that the accused persons have committed rioting as alleged. \n\"The prosecution could not adduce evidence in support of their case. Further, though the allegation is that the accused gathered in prosecution of their common object to spread COVID 19, there is no evidence to prove that accused shared such an object,\" the judgment stated.\nIt was also observed that the prosecution failed to submit any material to prove that there were any social distancing guidelines in place on June 19, 2020. \n\"There is no evidence to prove that the accused acted so as to spread COVID 19. There is nothing in the evidence adduced by the prosecution to prove that the accused have committed any act which was dangerous to public or which would cause failure in public safety,\" the Additional Magistrate stated in the judgment.\nThe accused politicians were, therefore, acquitted of all charges levelled against them."}

Therefore, she urged the High Court to stay the defamation proceedings initiated on Akhtar's complaint. \nJustice PD Naik pronounced the verdict today and observed that the trial in Akhtar's complaint had also already commenced and reached final stage, while Ranaut preferred this petition at a belated stage. \n\"After resorting to remedies challenging proceedings against Ranaut, the complaint was filed by Ranaut against Akhtar. Thereafter the present application was preferred. After filing the complaint belatedly,Ranaut contended that, both cases are to be tried simultaneously.

Akhtar's counsel argued that Ranaut had filed the petition only to delay proceedings in the defamation case initiated by the lyricist.\nBharadwaj also argued that there was no basis for Ranaut to invoke the writ jurisdiction of the High Court in this matter and that her prayers were vague and untenable."}

Sandeep Kumar]\nAdditional Sessions Judge Pulastya Pramachala found that several complaints were clubbed together for investigation without any sound basis. These clubbed complaints were then not properly looked into or investigated, the Court found.\n“I also find that additional 19 complaints were wrongly clubbed in this FIR and were not completely and properly investigated,\" the judgment said. \nThe Court made the observation while acquitting one, Sandeep Kumar who had earlier been accused of being part of a mob that had set on fire to the complainant, Shokin’s house and shop. The said mob was also accused of vandalism and looting of property by taking away several articles and jewellery.\nDuring the investigation, the police clubbed 19 more complaints with this case, citing the close proximity of the place of the incidents.\nHowever, the police filed a charge sheet only against Sandeep Kumar, who was identified by Shokin.\nFrom the evidence on record, the Court found that there were only two complaints from lane number 7, where Shokin’s property was damaged. The rest of the complaints were from different lanes, the Court noted.\nIn the supplementary chargesheet, the police had also declared eight complainants as untraced. \n“I fail to understand as to how could police file chargesheet and untrace report together in this case,” the Court remarked, in response.\nThe Court added that every complainant has a right to make his representation before the magistrate against such a report. In this case, however, the Court opined that the police had deprived the complainants of such an opportunity.\n“In the present case, due to several complaints wrongly taken up together in one FIR for investigation and filing one composite report of investigation for all such complaints, this important right of complainants could not be exercised by them,\" the judgment said. \nAs far as the case against Kumar was concerned, the Court concluded that his presence at the scene of the crime could not be established nor could his alleged role be proved, even if the incident of riot, vandalism, and loot was established. \nThus, Kumar was acquitted of all the charges against him.\nWith regard to other clubbed complaints in the same FIR, the Court found that none of the Investigating Officers even “bothered to ask” the two “alleged eyewitnesses” about the 19 other incidents.\n“Therefore, it is well apparent that practically, except for examining the 19 additional complainants, no other investigation was made, to find out time of those occurrences as well as culprits behind those incidents,\" the Court remarked.\nJudge Pramachala further observed that it will be injustice to the 19 additional complainants if the fate of their complaints is decided by the Court in the present case.\nThus, the Court directed the Station House Officer of Karawal Nagar to take up the additional 19 complaints for further investigation separately."}

{"ID": "id_1574", "Summary": "The Punjab and Haryana High Court on Wednesday quashed the First Information Report (FIR) lodged against former Aam Aadmi Party member Kumar Vishwas who was booked for hate speech and unlawful assembly after he had accused Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal of being a separatist [Kumar Vishwas vs State of Punjab].\nVishwas, who was booked for his statements made in February 2022 during the assembly elections in Punjab, had moved the High Court seeking quashing of the case. \nThe plea was allowed by Justice Anoop Chitkara, who said that freedom of speech is an essential component of democracy. \n\"There cannot be any democracy without freedom of choice and free speech. In a democracy, it is the pre-election times when people’s information matters the most. The petitioner being a social educator, while sharing the alleged exchange that took place with his ex-associate (Kejriwal), cannot be said to have spewed the venom. There is nothing to infer any intention to divide the classes on communal lines,\" the judge said in his order. \nVishwas had on February 16 and 17 had given an interview to media channels claiming that Kejriwal had once told him that he would become the chief minister or the prime minister of an independent State or country. \nIt was alleged that due to statements by Vishwas, unknown persons had wrongfully restrained the complainant (belonging to AAP) on April 12. \nVishwas was, subsequently, booked under Sections 153 A (attempt to create communal disharmony), 505 (attempt to incite public mischief), 341 (wrongful restraint), 116 (abetting an offence), 323 (causing hurt), 143 (unlawful assembly) 147 (rioting) and 120B (criminal conspiracy). \nThe bench, however, noted that there wasn't any proximity between the speech given in February and the incident of April or even the later incident of a ruckus created by some persons. \nThe Court said that none of the offences were prima facie made out against Vishwas.  \nThe judge highlighted the importance of free speech invoking the first speech given by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru to independent India.\n\"It has always been India's quest to flirt with new ways for self-realisation. Her  vivacity and dynamism can be greatly attributed to an environment of diversity and freedoms abound; the freedom to be an atheist, an antagonist, or a believer; choice to practice beliefs of karmas, re-birth...There exists an inherent liberty to individuals and the communities to propagate, follow, and spread the wisdom enshrined in the varied philosophies,\" the judge observed. \nAll these astounding attributes and paths were a result of the freedom to practice and inform, the Court noted. \n\"Even in the shackles of colonialism, her mind remained free and eager for deliverance. With the liberation of her soul, the swatantrata was not just from British rule but from the slavery of thoughts, unchaining of oneself from the subjugation of alien laws, restoring the absolute freedom to think, undoing the status quo, and spreading the information,\" the Court opined. \nIt further underscored that freedom of speech was one of the rights which Indians acquired \"at the stroke of the midnight\" on August 15, 1947. \n\"At the stroke of midnight, apart from liberty, we got azadi of choice and azadi of free speech and of expression; and we took a great leap forward by endorsing democracy, ushering equality and dignity, ensuring infinite opportunities to preserve and spearhead this fantastic diversity till eternity.\"\nWith regard to the facts of the case, the bench noted that Vishwas wasn't among those who had created ruckus or assaulted the AAP leaders.\n\"Thus, it would not be permissible to expand the scope of the complaint to connect the alleged subsequent incident by fishing the evidence and on the assumptions and suspicions of the complainant. This is a fit case for this court to prevent the abuse of the process of law because the allegations made in the complaint and the probe do not contain any material which even remotely links the incidents with the interviews of the petitioner,\" the judge opined. \nWith these observations, the bench quashed the FIR against Vishwas. \nSenior Advocates Randeep Rai and Chetan Mittal along with advocates Mayank Aggarwal and Rubina Virmani appeared for the Petitioner. \nSenior Advocate Puneet Bali along with Additional Advocates General Prashant Manchanda and Ferry Sofat and Deputy Advocate General HS Sitta and advocate Vaibhav represented State of Punjab. \nAdvocate Surjeet Bhadu appeared for the complainant."}

It is the culture in India to serve the old aged mother-in-law or grandmother-in-law, as the case may be, by the wife, in order to preserve this culture,\" the Court underlined.  \nHence, it held that a woman should not pressurise her husband to leave his mother.\nIn its judgment, the Court invoked Hindu religious texts including also Manusmriti to emphasise the importance of women in family. \nThe judge, while referring to Yajurveda, said, \"O woman you do not deserve to be defeated by challenges. You can defeat the mightiest challenge. Defeat the enemies and their armies you have a valour of thousand (Yajurveda).\nFurther, the court invoked verses in Manusmriti stating - Where women of the family are miserable, the family is soon destroyed but it always thrives where the women are contended. \nThese observations were made by the court while hearing an appeal filed by a man challenging an order of a family court in Dumka, which ordered him to pay ₹30,000 as maintenance to his estranged wife and ₹15,000 to their minor son. \nThe woman alleged that her husband and in-laws subjected her to cruelty and tortured her for dowry.\nOn the other hand, the husband alleged that the wife pressurised him to live separately from his mother and grandmother. He pointed out that the wife would often pick up quarrels with the two old women in the house and kept going to her parental house without informing him. \nThe Court noted that the evidence on record indicated that the wife was pressuring the husband for living separately from his mother and grandmother without any valid grounds.\nJustice Chand referred to a book titled Introduction to Family Life Education authored by Prof. Teresa Chacko, which details the role of a wife in the family and noted that the primary issue between the now estranged couple was that the wife doesn't want to serve the aged mother-in-law and grandmother-in-law, who are 75 years and 95 years old, respectively.\n\"She creates pressure on her husband to live separate from his mother and grandmother. It is the very reason, this ground is not found sufficient that's why the legislature whole enacting section 125(4) of the CrPC has provided one of the grounds for denial of maintenance - if the wife refuses to reside with the husband without any reasonable cause,\" the judge observed.  \nThe single-judge, therefore, quashed the family court order to the extent it allowed ₹30,000 maintenance to the wife and opined that since she has given no reasonable cause for living away from her husband, she is not entitled to any maintenance. The Court, however, enhanced the son's maintenance from ₹15,000 to ₹25,000. \nAdvocates Indrajit Sinha and Akhouri Awinash Kumar appeared for the husband. \nAdvocate Rahul Kumar represented the wife."}

{"ID": "id_1581", "Summary": "The Delhi High Court on Monday pulled up the Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan (KVS) for restricting participation of People with Disabilities in the recruitment process and ordered them to strictly implement the 4% reservation mandated by The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act) [National Federation of the Blind v Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan & Ors].\nA Division Bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice Sanjeev Narula held that the KVS’ advertisement of August 2018 for recruitment to the posts of Principal, Vice Principal, Post Graduate Teachers, Trained Graduate Teachers, Librarian etc was discriminatory and in violation of the RPwD Act.\nThe Court, therefore, set aside the advertisement and issued a slew of directions to the KVS.  \nIt ordered the KVS to conduct an audit of the total number of vacancies in the establishment and prepare a vacancy based roster within 3 months and file an affidavit of the same along with a timeline for filling the said vacancies.\n“If any vacancy, which ought to have been reserved in accordance with the 2016 Act, has already been filled by any person not falling in the reserved category due to failure of the respondent to reserve the same, the respondent shall adjust those vacancies from the unreserved pool of the available vacancies. Such vacancies shall be deemed to be unfilled and accordingly, shall be considered to have been carried forward from the vacancies notified in the impugned advertisement,” the Court said.\nThe Court also said that KVS shall compute the number of vacancies to be reserved for the persons with disabilities against the total number of vacancies in the cadre strength in each group, inclusive of both identified and unidentified posts.\n“The final appointment shall be made against the identified posts, even if the actual number of persons with disabilities appointed at a given post exceeds four percent; The respondent shall not create sub-categories subject-wise within a cadre; The vacancies shall be calculated on the total number of vacancies in a particular cadre and not on posts. The respondent shall reserve the post of Principal for persons with benchmark disabilities in blind or low vision category at a minimum of one percent for that particular category,\" the judgment said. \nThe Court passed these directions while dealing with a public interest litigation (PIL) petition filed by National Federation of the Blind arguing that the KVS has not implemented the statutory reservation for PwD candidates, particularly for blind persons.\nIt was stated that the advertisement was in violation of Section 34 of the RPwD Act which mandates 4 percent reservation for PwD candidates in both the identified and unidentified posts, out of which three categories of PwDs are entitled to 1 percent each of the reserved vacancies.\nThe Court was told the advertisement excluded the post of principal from the posts reserved for persons with visual disability and this was also absurd because the post of principal is a promotional post for the post of vice principal and the post of vice principal is a feeder post reserved for blind persons.\nAfter considering the case, the Bench observed that the KVS’ advertisement distinguishes persons with disabilities from others and puts a restriction on their potential to participate in the recruitment process to their full ability.\n\"It may be noted that an act of discrimination is not only a denial of the promise of equal protection before the law. Rather, every act of exclusion is an assault on the dignity of a person. More so, when the exclusion has the effect of compelling the persons with disabilities out of a race for gaining employment, without any fault of theirs. Instead of providing an equal space to grow, we have been compelling the persons with disabilities to prove, time and again, that they are capable of a lot more than we think,” the judgment stated. \nThe Court regretfully noted that despite the passage of almost four decades of the movement, one United Nations’ Convention and two legislations passed by the parliament, we were still struggling to fulfil our promises made to the persons with disabilities.\nThe more things change, the more they remain the same, the Bench said.\nSenior Advocate SK Rungta and Advocate Prashant Singh appeared for the petitioner National Federation of the Blind.\nKVS was represented through advocates S Rajappa and R Gourishankar.\nAdvocates Govind Manoharan, Diksha Tiwari, Apurva Singh, Anchit Singla and Nishchaiy appeared for NCTE.\nCentral Government Standing Counsel (CGSC) Monika Arora as well as advocate Yash Tyagi and Subhrodeep Saha appeared for the Union of India."}

{"ID": "id_1583", "Summary": "The Calcutta High Court recently said that merely because few persons have defrauded banks and fled from India, banks cannot use the same as a uniform rationale for issuing Look Out Circulars (LOC) in an indiscriminate manner [Manoj Kumar Jain vs Union of India].\nSingle-judge Justice Moushumi Bhattacharya said that issuance of LOCs should be regulated and must not be a norm for recovery of outstanding payments. \n\"The extreme repercussions of issuing a Look Out Circular must hence be regulated to give it form and certainty and not be made the norm for recovery of outstanding payments to the Bank. Isolated and few-and-far between cases of persons fleeing the country cannot become the uniform rationale for issuing of Look Out Circulars left, right and centre,\" the judgment stated.\nPertinently, the Court said that deboarding a person from a flight at the last moment based on such an LOC is draconian and uncivilised.\n\"There is something draconian and uncivilised in a person being deboarded from an aircraft without being informed of the reason for such. In most cases, the person concerned is simply handed a piece of paper and told at the last moment to de-plane without being made aware of the reason. This is against the principles of natural justice and fair play in action where the fundamental right to travel and the right to life is inexorably compromised and with impunity,\" the bench observed. \nLOCs have the effect of restricting a person's free movement and the right to travel, and should only be issued in exceptional circumstances when the person is likely to flee the country and not repay the outstanding loan, the Court emphasised. \n\"Look Out Circulars cannot be issued at random and at the slightest provocation particularly at the instance of a bank who seeks restriction on travel as a buffer to payments outstanding to the Bank. The only acceptable logic - albeit with some effort - is that a person may flee the country and not return to repay his/her outstanding loan. This, however, cannot be the rule across the board and a borrower's credentials and circumstances for making payment must be taken into account,\" the bench held.  \nThe bench was seized of a plea filed by one Manoj Jain, Director of Jain Infra Private Limited. \nHe had defaulted on a loan he availed from a consortium of 11 banks. He was disallowed to board a United Kingdom-bound flight in 2022 after the Immigration Authorities informed him about an LOC pending against him, issued at the instance of the Indian Overseas Bank. \nThe Court noted that Jain had repaid the dues of all the banks and had also offered a One Time Settlement (OTS) plan to two banks - Andhra Bank and IDBI Bank. \nAs far as the Indian Overseas Bank was concerned, the Court noted that the bank had already realised ₹86 lakh by selling a property mortgaged by the petitioners and the total value of immovable securities given to the said bank was ₹5.45 crores. \nBesides this, it noted that the petitioner was permitted to travel 19 times by the CBI Court and there was no complaint against him that he failed to comply with the conditions imposed or return to India on the scheduled date. \nThe argument that the petitioner continues to be a threat to the economic interest of the country is far-fetched and suffers from an absence of a rational basis, the Court said. \nThe Court further said that there is a recent trend of banks issuing LOCs as a recovery mechanism for outstanding monetary dues. The reasoning of the bank is that the person may frustrate settlement of the dues by not returning to India. The logic put forth is that the person’s bona fides in repaying the dues is best ensured if the person remains within reach, i.e. in the territory of India, the Court added. \n\"The Banks’ apprehension may be founded on a real threat of the person leaving the country forever and the Banks’ loans being written off. This  reasoning however, cannot apply across the board for all borrowers without exception. The criteria for assessing the credit-worthiness of a borrower and his/her bona fides for repayment must be determined on a case-to-case basis. The individual circumstances of a borrower’s ability and willingness to pay or the mode and manner of repayment must be assessed before the fundamental right of a person to travel is denied,\" the Court opined.  \nFurther, it noted that the ground used against the petitioners is evidently economic interests of India. \n\"But there is no evidence that the petitioners’ leaving the country for a specific period of time would affect the economic interest of India. The petitioners have not been declared fraudsters or money-launderers or even economic offenders,\" it was underscored. \nWith these observations, the Court quashed the LOC issued against the petitioner. \nAdvocates Sudip Deb, Riju Ghosh, Sumitava Chakraborty, Aranyak Saha and Ipsita Ghosh appeared for the petitioner. \nDeputy Solicitor General Billwadal Bhattacharya along with advocate Narendra Prasad Gupta represented the Central government.  \nAdvocates Shiv Mongal Singh and Moriam Sanfui appeared for the banks."}

{"ID": "id_159", "Summary": "The Supreme Court on Tuesday struck down the West Bengal Housing Industry Regulation Act, 2017 (WBHIRA) as unconstitutional for being in conflict with Central legislation already occupying the field, i.e. the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 (RERA). \nThe Court held that State of West Bengal encroached upon the domain of Parliament in enacting WBHIRA since both WBHIRA and RERA deal with the same entry in the concurrent list and a significantly large number of provisions of WBHIRA overlap with RERA.\n\"From our analysis of RERA and WBHIRA, two fundamental features that emerge are that WBHIRA overlaps with RERA and is copied word to word and it does not complement RERA. Both the statutes refer to same entry in the concurrent list,\" the Court said. \nThe State has enacted a parallel mechanism and regime entailed under RERA, the Court concluded. \nOnce parliament has enacted a law on a subject, it is not open to State legislature to enact a similar law and lift it word to word, the Court said. \n\"The overlap is so significant that test of repugnance based on identity of subject matter is established. West Bengal has attempted to establish a parallel regime which is not Constitutionally permissible,\" the Court ruled. \nThe State legislature has encroached on the subject of the parliamentary legislation which has a higher weightage in matters of entries of concurrent list, the Court added. \nThe judgment was delivered by a Bench of Justices DY Chandrachud and MR Shah in a plea by NGO Forum for People’s Collective Efforts, which contended that the WBHIRA should be struck down since it conflicts with RERA [Forum for Peoples Collective Efforts v. State of West Bengal].\nThe Court, however, clarified that striking down of WBHIRA will not affect the sanctions permissions granted under WBHIRA prior to the delivery of the judgment.\n\"This power has been exercised to safeguard past decisions and prevent chaos,\" the Court said.\nThe top court noted that a significant and even overwhelmingly large part of WB-HIRA overlaps with the provisions of RERA. \n\"These provisions of the RERA have been lifted bodily, word for word and enacted into the State enactment. Second, in doing so, WB-HIRA does not complement the RERA by enacting provisions which may be regarded as in addition to or fortifying the rights, obligations and remedies created by the Central enactment,\" reads the judgment. \nThe WBHIRA was challenged on the ground that while Article 254(2) allows law made by State on a Concurrent list subject to survive over Central law on the same subject, such State law to receive the assent of the President.\nIn this case, the same was not obtained. \nRERA was enacted by the Central Government in 2016. In August the same year, West Bengal notified the draft Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Rules, 2016 under the RERA. To finalise these rules, a stakeholder meeting was also arranged in 2017, for which the petitioner was also invited. However, no further action was taken thereafter.\nInstead, the WBHIRA, 2017 was notified in March 2018 and rules under the WBHIRA was also published in June 2018.\nThe top court has further held that the state law was repugnant to the parliament enacted law. While holding so the court has elaborated on the tests of repugnancy:\nThe three tests of Repugnancy as stated by the court are:\n1.Where the provision of a State enactment is directly in conflict with a law enacted by Parliament, so that compliance with one is impossible along with obedience to the other. \n2. Where Parliament through the legislative provisions contained in the statute has enacted an exhaustive code. The second test of repugnancy is based on an intent of Parliament to occupy the whole field covered by the subject of its legislation. \n3. Third postulates that the subject matter of the legislation by the State is identical to the legislation which has been enacted by Parliament, whether prior or later in point of time.\n\"WB-HIRA, on the contrary, purports to occupy the same subject as that which has been provided in the Parliamentary legislation. The state law fits, virtually on all fours, with the footprints of the law enacted by Parliament. This is constitutionally impermissible. What the legislature of the State of West Bengal has attempted to achieve is to set up its parallel legislation involving a parallel regime,\" ruled Supreme Court. \nThe petitioner assailed the same before the Supreme Court contending that that it is in direct conflict with the earlier framed RERA, a Central legislation.\nThe petitioner pointed out that both legislations deal with subjects falling under Entries 6 (property transfer), 7 (matters of contract) and 46 (matters concerning the jurisdiction of courts other than Supreme Court) of the Concurrent List in the Constitution of India.\nThus, it was contended that while both the Central and State governments may make laws on such subjects, the State law would have to yield to the Central law if there is any conflict between the two.\nIt was further highlighted by the petitioner that the only way for State law to survive would be in terms of Article 254 (2) of the Constitution.\nArticle 254 (2) allows for a conflicting State law on a concurrent list subject to prevail over a central law, if it receives the assent of the President. However, it was argued by the petitioner that such assent was not received with respect to WBHIRA. \n“It is an admitted position that the State of West Bengal neither reserved the impugned State Act for consideration of the President nor had ever obtained the President’s assent inspite of the fact that the entire field stood occupied by RERA, 2016 enacted by the Parliament.”\nFurther noting how the law enacted by West Bengal was unconstitutional the Supreme Court has noted that \"State legislature has encroached upon the legislative authority of Parliament which has supremacy within the ambit of the subjects falling within the Concurrent List of the Seventh Schedule.\"\nThe Court while striking down the law said that it will not result in revival of 1993 WBHIRA. \n\"The provisions of WBHIRA 1993 act stood repealed after enactment of the HIRA 2016 act. Our striking down provisions of 2016 act will not revive the 1993 act in any way,\" the Court ruled \nRegarding the absence of additional safeguards as compared to RERA, the court notes that Section 80(2) of the RERA provides that no Court inferior to a Metropolitan Magistrate or JMFC shall try an offence punishable under the Act and that no such provision is contained in WB-HIRA."}
{"ID": "id_1591", "Summary": "The Calcutta High Court on October 10, Tuesday, paved the way for the appointment of an elected woman candidate who belonged to a Scheduled Tribe (ST) and was from a minority political party as the Pradhan of a Gram Panchayat to ensure that the reservation policy for such a post was not flouted [Srimanta Malik vs State of West Bengal].\nJustice Amrita Sinha reasoned that if the benefit of reservation is not given to an elected reserved category candidate, the reservation policy itself would be defeated. \n\"If the elected reserved category candidate is not allowed the benefit of reservation, then the reservation policy will be frustrated. Reserved category member elected from the minority party will never get a chance to hold key posts and seats,\" the Court said. \nThe Court added that the members enjoying the political majority should not make things difficult for the ST candidate, only because she is from a political party that won the minority of seats. \n\"After the elections are over, all the members of the Gram Panchayat ought to act in tandem with each other and ought not to oppose the action of the member belonging to a rival political party. The sole intention of the members of the Gram Panchayat should be to act as a team and serve the electors of the Panchayat. There ought not to be any infighting in between the members and the Panchayat should behave as a single entity,\" the Court added.\nThe Court passed the order after noting that the post of the Pradhan was reserved for an ST individual and that the woman in question was the only candidate from the reserved category.\nThe woman's appointment to the post had been opposed by 17 other elected candidates, who were members of the political party that emerged as the majority party after the elections. \nThe 17 candidates moved a petition in the High Court claiming that the woman candidate did not enjoy the confidence of the majority of members of the 22-member Gram Panchayat. Thus, she should not be allowed to head the Panchayat, they argued. \nJustice Sinha replied that if this contention were accepted, it would become practically impossible to follow the reservation policy prescribed under the Constitution of India. \nFurther, the judge observed that when reserved party candidates are not allowed to hold reserved posts, bye-elections have to be held.\n\"To prevent mid-term elections, the elected member ought to be permitted to hold office. Co-option ought not to be exercised if the reserved category candidate is available. If none is available from the reserved category, then co-option may be resorted to,\" the Court added. \nThe bench further refused to accept the contention of the petitioners (the 17 other elected candidates) that they would not accept the woman candidate as a Pradhan even for a single day. \nThe Court responded by emphasising that the woman must be given an opportunity to prove her credibility. \n\"Prior to giving her an opportunity to serve the people, she ought not to be taken as an incompetent person to assume the office of Pradhan,\" the bench said.\nThe judge also refused to accept an allegation that the woman had failed to attend a meeting earlier when the members of the Panchayat were to appoint the Pradhan. Rather, the Court observed that she appeared to have been restrained from attending the meeting and was even compelled to approach the police for help. \nJustice Sinha proceeded to opine that the woman must be permitted to hold the post of Pradhan. \nShe added that if the woman is found incompetent or fails to win confidence even after a year, then there were provisions for the removal of the Pradhan that may be resorted to. \nWith these observations, the bench dismissed a plea filed by the majority party candidates (petitioners).\nAdvocates Kallol Basu and Suman Banerjee appeared for the petitioners.\nAdvocates Samrat Choudhury and Abhijeet Bhattacharyya represented the minority party members.\nAdvocates Lalit Mohan Mahata and Ziaul Haque represented the State government."}

MoD is authorized to design operational requirement of armed forces. Bonafides of MoD is apparent from security concerns raised in security committee meeting,\" the Court said.\n\"This court in exercise of judicial review cannot second guess the requirements of army,\" the Bench added.\nCourt cannot question the policy choice of the government, the judgment further said.\n\"We allow the application by Defence Ministry for double lane highways for three strategic highways,\" the Court ordered.\nThe three highways are: \n- Rishikesh to Gangotri (NH 94 and NH 108)\n- Rishikesh to Mana (NH 58)\n- Tanakpur to Pithoragarh (NH 125)\nHowever, the Court also did not brush aside the environmental concerns raised by the petitioner -NGO, Citizens for Green Doon while also noting the conclusion by the HPC that best practices were not adopted by the government in some places during the construction.\n\"HPC notes that best practices were not adopted in some places. HPC has also noted harm committed in some areas and has suggested remedies for the same and has suggested future action to reduce the impact,\" the Court said.\nEnvironmental impact of these roads cannot be any less important here, the Bench made it clear.\n\"High powered committee recommendations on environmental concerns have to be followed,\" the judgment emphasised.\nIt, therefore, set up an oversight committee headed by retired Supreme Court judge Justice AK Sikri to oversee the project with respect to the three highways and report to the Court directly on the same. \n\"The oversight committee shall ensure that recommendations of HPC is implemented and not conduct a fresh analysis. If any breach takes place, the chairman of the committee can approach this court,\" the Court directed.\nThe HPC will continue to oversee the work apart from the three highways, the Court said.\nThe Chardham Mahamarg Vikas Pariyojna is a program of the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways , which was announced on December 23, 2016. The project aims to widen the roads of approximately 900 kms of national highways, in order to ensure safer, smoother and faster traffic movement.\nThese highways connect the holy shrines which have been labelled as the “Chote Char Dham” in the State of Uttarakhand\nOne of the benefits of the project as claimed by the Central government is that it will facilitate rapid deployment and movement of Indian Armed forces along China border.\nHowever, according to Central government’s own notification of 2018, the road width cannot exceed 5.5 meters in the hilly terrains like the one through which Char Dham road is proposed.\nIn August 8, 2019, when the matter came up before a Bench of Justices Rohinton Nariman and Surya Kant, the Court had ordered constitution of High Powered Committee (HPC) to consider the cumulative and independent impact of the Chardham project on the entire Himalayan valleys.\nThe HPC, with the help of the technical body and engineers of implementation agency (MoRTH) should consider whether revision of the full Chardham project (about 900 Kms) should at all take place with a view to minimize the adverse impact of the project on environment and social life, the Court had directed.\n“The HPC shall identify the sites in which work (i.e. hill-cutting) has started and the stretches in which the work has not yet started. As far as the sites in which work has started, the High Powered Committee should recommend the measures which are required for stabilizing the area where hill-cutting has taken place, among others, the environmentally safe disposal of muck which has been generated so that it does not adversely affect the flora and fauna of the catchment area of the river.\nAs regards the stretches where work has not started, the HPC will review the proposed project and recommend measures which will minimize the adverse impact on environment, social life and bring the project in conformity with the steep valley terrain, carrying capacity, thus avoiding any triggering of new landslides and ensuring conservation and protection of sensitive Himalayan valleys,” the August 2019 order said.\nPursuant to the order, the HPC delivered a report in July 2020.\nThe Supreme Court in September 2020 accepted the report of the HPC but with a narrow variance, that road width shall not exceed 5.5 meters as prescribed in the 2018 circular.\nInterestingly, this was in tune with the minority opinion of the HPC report.\n“Whereas, a majority of 13 members of the HPC was in favour of applying the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MORTH) circular of 2012, which laid down a certain standard, the minority-five members, including the Chairman were of the opinion that the latest MORTH circular dated March 23, 2018 should govern. We have perused the conclusions and recommendations of the report, in particular, from pages 90-93 in Part I. We are of the view that it is correct that the 2018 MORTH circular should apply for the reasons given at page 93 of the report. Consequently, the 2018 circular alone will apply,” the Court ordered on September 8, 2020.\nSubsequently, an application was filed by the MoD seeking modification of this Court’s order dated September 8, 2020.\nThe application said that there was a material change in circumstances, necessitating an improvement of roads to enable movement of troops and equipment to Army stations on the Indo-China border. Thus, the application urged that a double lane road having a carriageway width of 7 m or 7.5m is necessary to meet the Army’s requirement.\nThe Central government also amended its 2018 notification in December 2020 to increase road width limit from 5.5 meters to 10 meters."}

{"ID": "id_1595", "Summary": "The Kerala High Court on Tuesday dismissed a petition that sought the removal of PM Narendra Modi's photograph from the COVID vaccination certificates issued via the CoWIN portal [Peter Myaliparampil v Union of India].\nThe Court also imposed costs of ₹1 lakh on the petitioner Peter Myaliparampil stating that the plea is frivolous and seems to have been filed with political motives \n\"According to my opinion this is a frivolous petition filed with ulterior motives. there seems to be political motives and deserves to be dismissed with heavy cost. Plea dismissed with costs of ₹1 lakh,\" the single-judge ordered.\n\"I know this is a heavy cost but we must prevent such frivolous petitions,\" the judge added.\nThe costs have to be paid to Kerala State Legal Services Authority within a period of 6 weeks.\nThe Court also mused how thousands of matters concerning liberty of individuals are pending before the Court and petitions of the present kind end up wasting the Court's time.\n\"In such a situation such frivolous petitions must be dismissed with heavy cost. Therefore petition is dismissed with ₹1 lakh cost,\" the Court said.\nThe judgment was delivered by single-judge Justice PV Kunhikrishnan on a petition filed by a Right to Information (RTI) activist who claimed to have received paid COVID-19 vaccination from a private hospital. \nThereafter, he received a vaccination certificate which had a photograph of Prime Minister Narendra Modi along with the message: “medicine and strict controls (in Malayalam), together India will defeat COVID-19 (in English)”.\nThe petitioner had claimed that his concern that the national campaign against Covid-19 was being used as a media campaign for the PM was fortified on receiving the certificate with the photograph.\nThe Court had previously questioned the petitioner on his objection to the inclusion of the photograph and asked him why he seemed to be ashamed of the PM. \n\"He became PM because of the mandate of the people. We have different political opinions but he is still our prime minister,\" the Court had remarked during the hearing of the matter on December 13.\nThe Court had also asked for an explanation as to how the inclusion of current PM Narendra Modi's image on vaccine certificates differs from naming a university in the name of former PM Jawaharlal Nehru.\n\"What is the problem if Prime Minister Modi's name is there on the vaccine certificate? You work at an Institute named after Jawaharlal Nehru, he is also a Prime Minister. Why not ask the university to remove that name also\", the judge had orally remarked.\nThe petitioner, through advocate Ajit Joy, had contended that affixing the PM's photograph on COVID certificate, particularly when he had paid for the vaccination, is a violation of his fundamental rights as he can be considered as captive audience.\nThis goes against his free speech right, including the right against compelled listening, protected by Article 19 of the Constitution of India, it was argued.\nReferring to the guidelines laid down by the Supreme Court (in Common Cause v. Union of India) on campaigns using public money, it was pointed out that no individual, including the Prime Minister, can be credited for the launch of an initiative or be celebrated for achievements of a certain policy of the State on government expense.\nFurther, it was argued that the vaccine certificate is an individual's private space with personal health details and the inclusion of a photograph of the PM is wholly unnecessary and intrusive. Pertinently, it was contended that it violates citizens' independent choice of voting by using the vaccine certificate as the campaign space for one individual.\nFor the Central government, it was argued that the petition is not maintainable as there is no mention of violation of constitutional rights. Moreover, the petitioner has only paid for the vaccination, not the vaccine certificate, it was contended."}
{"ID": "id_1598", "Summary": "The Allahabad High Court has refused to grant any interim relief against release of Amitabh Bachchan starrer Bollywood film 'Chehre' in a plea alleging copyright infringement (Uday Prakash v. Anand Pandit). \nSingle-judge Justice JJ Munir said that while the movie and the copyrighted work alleged to have been plagiarised, appear to have come from a common source, they are materially different in treatment and development.\n\"There is, thus, prima facie a materially different and distinctive development and treatment of the same theme in both the scripts. In the prima facie opinion of this Court, there is, apart from the fundamentals of the basic theme that appear to have come from a common source, no such distinctive feature in the copyrighted version that have been prima facie plagiarized,\" the order said.\nThe Court was hearing an appeal against an order of District Judge, Ghaziabad who had rejected the application of the plaintiff, Uday Prakash for temporary injunction in his suit for infringement of copyright.\nIt was Prakash's case that his copyrighted script was plagiarised by defendant, Anand Pandit who is the producer of 'Chehre'.\nThe plaintiff contended that he had obtained copyright registration for his work from Copyright Office, New Delhi under the name 'Highway-39' way back in 2007.\nHe later discussed the copyrighted work with one of his acquaintances, Mazhar Kamran, who was at the relevant time, working with the plaintiff as a cameraman on several audio visual projects.\nLater, Mazhar Kamran had assured the latter that he would show the copyrighted work to a few prominent producers, of whom Anand Pandit was one (defendant no.1).\nIn June 2019, Prakash came to know, from reliable sources in the film industry, that Pandit is making a movie which is very similar to his copyrighted work.\n\"The plaintiff claims that he was given information that defendant no.1 has scheduled a release of the movie under the name and title of ‘Chehre’. The plaintiff also asserts that he read news and collected information available in the public domain that the movie, last mentioned, went into production somewhere around the month of May, 2019,\" the Court noted.\nThe plaintiff contended that he has so far not assigned, transferred or sold his copyright in the copyrighted work to any third party and he holds it in his name alone. \nThe violation of the plaintiff’s copyright is causing loss of name and reputation to the plaintiff, it was submitted.\nIt was further argued that the infringement due to production and release of the feature film would cause the plaintiff severe harassment, loss of reputation and a cascading effect on the plaintiff’s professional prospects, vis-a-vis his reputation as an author.\nThe Court, however, compared the two scripts after which it opined that it shows that while the principle theme is common to both scripts, there are \"a host of differences in the script leading to the feature film.\"\nIn this light, the Court rejected the plea for temporary injunction to stay the release of the movie.\nThe Court, however, directed the trial court to decide the suit expeditiously and conclude the trial within four months. \n\"It is, therefore, to be ordered that if the plaintiff succeeds, all further displays of the feature film shall have to carry an acknowledgment, suitably to be displayed that the movie is based on the copyrighted work, which is the plaintiff's authorship.

{"ID": "id_1599", "Summary": "The Rajasthan High Court recently commuted the death sentence to life imprisonment of four men of a family, convicted for killing four persons including a minor over a land dispute. [State of Rajasthan vs Atmaram Lakhara].\nThe High Court reasoned that the case doesn't warrant death sentence and accordingly commuted it to life imprisonment till the remainder of their lives.\nA bench of Justices Sandeep Mehta and Vinod Kumar Bharwani was hearing appeals filed by Atmaram Lakhara, Omprakash and Leeladhar - all brothers, along with Sharvan Kumar, son of Leeladhar. \nThe four men challenged the judgment of a sessions court at Bhadra, Hanumangarh district which by an order dated June 1, 2019 had handed down death sentence to them. \nAs per the prosecution case, the four men along with other unknown persons attacked Kailash, his father Bhanwarlal and brother Pankaj while they were harvesting crop in their field. While Bhanwarlal and Pankaj died on the spot, the accused poured some chemical in the eyes of Kailash due to which he lost his vision and died after after a few days. \nAfter assaulting and killing the trio on June 13, 2013, the accused then reached the home of the victim to assault Bhanwarlal's father Moman Ram and his daughter Chandrakala. In this assault, Moman Ram died on the spot while Chandrakala sustained severe injuries\nThe trial court in its verdict noted that three members of the family were brutally assaulted in the field and some corrossive substance was poured in the eyes of Kailash after assaulting him. All four male members of the family who were aged between 16 and 75 years, were eliminated and that a consorted effort was made by the heavily armed members of the unlawful assembly to completely obliterate the family by assaulting Chandrakala her mother Sushila as well, but they somehow survived. The attack the trial court had said was fuelled by motive/enmity arising from a land dispute. \nThe trial court further noted that the evidence of Chandrakala established the fact that the accused persons came to the village after assaulting the victims in the agricultural field and were hurling exhortations that those in the field had been eliminated and Moman Ram and the female members would also be killed.\nWhile the trial court heavily relied upon the dying declaration of Kailash, the High Court bench led by Justice Mehta held the same to have several discrepancies and doubted it's \"creditworthiness.\"\nThe High Court, however, relied on the statements of Chandrakala, who was an injured witness in the case. \nConsidering the material on record, the bench said upheld the conviction. \n\"We are of the firm opinion that the prosecution has proved by unimpeachable reliable testimony, the factum of the assault made by the four accused appellants and two absconding accused Rakesh and Pawan in the field, where Bhanwar Lal and Pankaj were murdered and Kailash was seriouslyinjured and later on died and in the residential premises, where Moman Ram was murdered and Chandrakala was caused numerous injuries,\" the Court said.\nHowever, as far as the death penalty was concerned, the bench noted that the four convicts suffered incarceration in prison since the year 2013. \n\"True it is that the conduct of the accused while launching the pre-planned assault on the three victims in the field and on Moman Ram and Chandrakala at their residence was heinous as well as brutal. However, it is a universally acceptable proposition that reformative theory has to be given precedence over capital punishment, which should be considered a last resort,\" the bench observed. \nThough the trial court has undertaken the exercise of trying to assess the mitigating and aggravating circumstances, but the High Court took the view that the case does not satisfy the requirements for awarding the extreme death penalty. \nThe bench, therefore, commuted the death sentence. \nHowever, the Court made it clear the life imprisonment would be for the remainder of their natural life. \n\"If the accused are permitted to roam at large without suffering the 'imprisonment for life' in its literal meaning, they would in all likelihood eliminate the remaining family members as well if set at liberty,\" the Court said."}

As a prospective candidate for judgeship, he has not been surreptitious about his orientation. In view of the constitutionally recognized rights which the candidate espouses, it would be manifestly contrary to the constitutional principles laid down by the Supreme Court to reject his candidature on that ground,\" the Collegium said.\nImportantly, the Collegium underlined that Kirpal possesses competence, integrity and intellect and his appointment will add value to the bench of the Delhi High Court and provide inclusion and diversity.\n\"It may have been advisable for the candidate not to speak to the press in regard to the reasons which may have weighed in the recommendations of the Collegium being sent back for reconsideration. However, this aspect should not be considered as a negative feature, particularly since the name has remained pending for over five years,\" the Collegium opined.\nKirpal was unanimously recommended by the Delhi High Court Collegium on October 13, 2017 and the same was approved by the Supreme Court Collegium on November 11, 2021.\nThe recommendation was referred back to the Supreme Court Collegium on November 25, 2022 for reconsideration."}

State of Uttar Pradesh and Other]\nA Division Bench of Justices Anjani Kumar Mishra and Deepak Verma was adjudicating a petition moved by one Satyaprakash, seeking direction to the respondent authorities to conduct a fair investigation into a criminal case under Sections 363 (punishment for kidnapping), 366 (kidnapping, abducting or inducing woman to compel her marriage, etc) of the Indian Penal Code. \nIt was the case of the petitioner that the police was acting in collusion with the accused persons and neither were the accused persons arrested nor any charge sheet filed against them.\nFurther, the petitioner was aggrieved by the manner in which the investigation was being conducted.\nAt the outset, the Court relied on a decision of the Supreme Court in Sudhir Bhaskarrao Tambe v. Hemant Yashwant Dhage (2016) 6 SCC 277, wherein it was observed that person having grievance with regard to proper investigation not being done by the authorities, can move an application before the Magistrate concerned under Section 156(3) CrPC and thereby, the Magistrate thereby can direct proper investigation to be done and can also monitor the investigation.\nIn Sudhir Bhaskarrao Tambe, the top court had relied on its earlier decision in Sakiri Vasu v. State of Uttar Pradesh (2008) 2 SCC 409, in which the Court had observed that if a person has a grievance that his FIR has not been registered by the police, or proper investigation is not being done, then the person can approach the Magistrate concerned under Section 156(3) CrPC, the Magistrate can thereby direct the FIR to be registered, or he can also direct proper investigation to be done.\nMoreover, the Court also relied upon the decision of the Supreme Court in TC Thangaraj v. V Engammal (2011) 12 SCC 328 and M Subramaniam and another v. S Janaki and Another, to emphasize that the Magistrate has the power to monitor investigation under Section 156(3) CrPC.\nThe Supreme Court in M Subramaniam had affirmed the decision in Sakiri Vasu and observed that:\n\"Section 156 (3) is wide enough to include all such powers in a Magistrate which are necessary for ensuring a proper investigation, and it includes the power to order registration of an FIR and of ordering a proper investigation if the Magistrate is satisfied that a proper investigation has not been done, or is not being done by the police. Section 156 (3) CrPC, though briefly worded, in our opinion, is very wide and it will include all such incidental powers as are necessary for ensuring a proper investigation.\"\nWhile disposing of the present petition, the High Court granted liberty to the petitioner to invoke the power of the Magistrate available under the CrPC in the light of the law laid down by the Supreme Court as above-mentioned.\nAdvocates Mohammad Khalid and Pawan Kumar Yadav appeared for the petitioner."}

[The State of Maharashtra vs Rohit Chandrakant Jadhav]\nSpecial Judge Nazera S Shaikh turned down the argument of the accused Rohit Chandrakant Jadhav that the relationship was consensual and that he was uninformed of the survivor's juvenility.\nThe accused was, consequently, held guilty and sentenced to 10 years in prison. \n\"From the cross-examination of the victim, it is clear that she was having love affair with the accused and the sexual relations were consensual. However, it is already proved that the victim was minor at the time of incident...if, a person commits penetrative sexual assault on a child then, the offence is made out and there is no need to prove that the accused had no knowledge of the juvenility of the victim,\" she observed.\nAllegedly, the accused and the minor were \"in a relationship\" and often met. The family discovered the pregnancy in June 2016 when the girl took ill and was hospitalised.\nSpecial Prosecutor Geeta Sharma stated that even though the prosecution had only interrogated the survivor and the investigating officer, the quality of evidence was what was important and not the number. \nShe claimed that the victim was pregnant and hospitalised at the time relevant time when the complaint was filed. She informed the court that the survivor's pregnancy had been medically terminated, and the DNA of the fetus indicated that the accused was the biological father.\nShe contended that because the defence accepted the victim and accused's love connection, penetrative sexual assault was not contested.\nAdvocate Sudarshan Gamare defending the accused contended that while there was a romantic connection between the survivor and the accused, it was totally voluntary.\nHe stated that the accused was willing to marry the minor girl, but the her family was reluctant. Therefore, he contended that the accused committed no crime and deserved to be acquitted.\nFurthermore, he stated that during her cross-examination, the survivor revealed to the police that she provided a false statement to protect the accused and particularly admitted that the sexual encounters were with her approval. \nHe called the court's attention to the fact that the victim testified that the complaint was submitted on her mother's and grandmother's instance, not her own.\nSince the DNA report corroborated that there was penetrative sexual assault on the survivor at the hands of accused, the court held that the prosecution had proved that he had committed the offences alleged against him. \nIt placed the onus on the accused to rebut the presumption under Sections 29 and 30 of the POCSO Act.\nApart from denial, the accused was unable to present any proof or credible explanation to counter the inference. Even in his recorded testimony under section 313 of the Criminal Procedure Code, he indicated that the survivor informed him that she was a major. \nHe claimed to be unaware of her age. \nHe alleged that because he was of a lower caste, the survivor's family was opposed to their marriage and that a bogus case was launched against him. The court found his rebuttal to be inadequate to absolve him of accountability.\n\"As the presumption remain un-rebutted, inference required to be drawn that accused has committed aggravated penetrative sexual assault upon victim, a minor aged 15 years 8 months on more than one occasion,\" it concluded.\nThe Court, therefore, convicted him of the offences of rape under the Indian Penal Code and aggravated penetrative sexual assault under the POCSO Act, respectively.\nHe was sentenced to ten years rigorous imprisonment along with a fine of ₹5,000 out of which ₹3,000 was directed to be paid to the minor girl as compensation."}
{"ID": "id_1608", "Summary": "The Kerala High Court recently held that a Special Court for trying National Investigation Agency (NIA) cases is empowered to grant pardon at any stage of proceedings in a case [Suresh Raj v National Investigation Agency].\nA division bench of Justices K Vinod Chandran and C Jayachandran held that a special court, which has all the powers of a sessions court, can grant pardon at any stage, under Sections 306 and 307 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC).\n\"Being a court of original criminal jurisdiction and having been specifically bestowed with the power to take congnizance, without a formal commitment of the case, a Special Court can exercise the powers to grant pardon, either under Section 306 or under Section 307 , at any stage of the proceedings; of course subject to the propriety, good faith and bona fides of exercise of such power, which also has to be made judiciously,\" the judgment stated.\nThe Court also said that it is always advisable for a Special Court to consider an application for grant of pardon by itself, if cognisance is taken directly, even though it is empowered to refer it to the Chief Judicial Magistrate.\nThe Court was considering an appeal moved by a person arrayed as accused no.6 in a case being tried by a Special NIA Court.\nIn 2021, several persons were apprehended in connection with the seizure of a Sri Lankan fishing boat transporting huge quantities of heroin, some AK-47 rifles and ammunition, and were charged for offences under the Arms Act and the Indian Penal Code. \nThe appellant and one other accused were also charged under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) as they were found to be members of the proscribed organisation, Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). \nThe NIA later filed an application before the Special NIA Court to grant pardon to three of the other accused. \nThe Special Court decided to consider said application at the pre-cognisance stage overruling the objections of the appellant, leading to the appeal before the High Court. \nAdvocate Sangeetha Lakshmana, appearing for the appellant, challenged the Special Court's decision on the following grounds:\nThe application for pardon filed at pre-cognisance stage should have been forwarded to Chief Judicial Magistrate who alone can grant pardon under Section 306 CrPC;\nThe application should not have been considered under Section 307 CrPC as the three persons were not included as accused in the final report.\nAssistant Solicitor General (ASG) Manu S, appearing for the NIA, opposed the appeal on the following grounds:\nBeing a court of original criminal jurisdiction, the Special Court can invoke the powers under both Sections 306 and 307;\nA person for whom pardon is sought for does not necessarily have to be an accused as Sections 306 and 307 do say 'any person supposed to have been directly or indirectly concerned in or privy to an offence';\nCo-accused has no locus standi to challenge a proceeding for grant of pardon to another;\nAppeal against an interlocutory order is not maintainable.\nThe Court concurred with the ASG on all four grounds.\nSection 16(3) of the NIA Act states, \"Subject to the other provisions of this Act, a Special Court shall, for the purpose of trial of any offence, have all the powers of a Court of Session and shall try such offence as if it were a Court of Session so far as may be in accordance with the procedure prescribed in the Code for the trial before a Court of Session.\"\nTherefore, the Court held that uninfluenced by the stage of investigation, inquiry or trial, a Special Court can entertain an application for grant of pardon, since it has the powers under Sections 306 and 307.\nThe language employed in Sections 306 and 307, as pointed out by the ASG, was taken note of by the Court which agreed that pardon can be sought for persons who are not necessarily arrayed as accused but who are directly or indirectly concerned in or privy to an offence.\nThe Court also concurred with the ASG that the co-accused has no right to challenge challenge an order for considering the tender of pardon sought by the investigating agency.\nIt further held that the appeal, being against an interlocutory order, was not maintainable as per Section 21(1) of the NIA Act. \n\"However, since we spent considerable time on the issue raised by the appellant and that clarity as regards the procedure is warranted for future guidance, we thought it appropriate to address the issues on merits as well,\" the Court said in conclusion."}

{"ID": "id_1615", "Summary": "In sexual crimes against women, while the dignity of woman has to be protected at all cost, that does not absolve the prosecution of its duty to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt, the Bombay High Court said while reversing a conviction of a man accused of sexual harassment [Samir Rajesh Sathe v. State of Maharashtra & Anr.]. \nSingle-judge Justice Bharati Dangre quashed and set aside a judgment passed by a special court which had convicted and sentenced a man to two years imprisonment for assaulting his minor girlfriend in public because she wanted to end her relationship with him. \nThe special court had convicted the man for offences punishable under Sections 354 (outraging modesty of the woman) and 354-A (sexual harassment) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).\nWhile setting aside the order, Justice Dangre observed that the prosecution had failed to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt and hence, the benefit of doubt ought to be given to the accused to acquit him. \n“True it is that dignity of a woman is to be protected at any cost, but that itself do not absolve the prosecution of establishing it’s case beyond reasonable doubt and, since the prosecution has miserably failed to discharge the burden caste on it, the benefit must necessarily go to the accused,” the Court held.\nThe man was 22 years old and the girl was 17 years old when the alleged incident took place. They were residing in the same locality and were in a relationship. The girl had stated that when she came to know that the man had been in prison for a year, she started avoiding him and wanted to end the relationship. However, the man called her over phone and sent text messages. \nThe accused later asked her to come for a final meeting, and they met in February 2022. During the meeting, the man allegedly started checking the girl’s phone and on the suspicion that she may be cheating, started assaulting her in presence of her friends.\nThe assault happened after the girl stated that she did not want to be in a relationship with him. \nThe girl filed a complaint before the police and claimed that the man was a habitual offender with two rape cases pending against him. \nAfter a trial of less than 6 months, the special POCSO judge convicted the man opining that the punishment would have a deterrent effect.\nOn appeal by the accused, Justice Dangre noted that the girl had known the accused for over 2 years and was in a relationship with him.\nThe judge also noted the several inconsistencies and omissions in the girl’s depositions which led to the evidence losing credibility. \n“These omissions are proved through the investigating officer and on the omissions being proved, the case of the prosecution loses it’s credibility to a great extent and call for close scrutiny of the girl’s version,” the Court said. \nIt also relied on the deposition given by the girl’s friend who was allegedly present at the time of the incident. The friend in her deposition said that no such incident happened in her presence, and thus did not support the girl’s inconsistent version. \n“The testimony of the prosecution witnesses, including the complainant herself, has clearly created a huge dent in the prosecution case. The occurrence of the incident itself is doubtful and the special judge has fallen in grave error in not accepting the fact that the two were in a relationship,” the Court held. \nHence, it set aside the conviction."}

The recommendations made by Rajya Sabha on money bills are not binding on Lok Sabha which may choose to reject it. \nThe Court in Rojer Mathew case, therefore, referred the legal issue relating to certification of money bills to a larger Bench in view of the fact that both Rojer Mathew and Aadhaar were by a Bench of five judges. \nJustice Chandrachud has now dissented in the review of Aadhaar judgment citing the Rojer Mathew case. \nThe constitutional principles of consistency and the rule of law would require that a decision on the review petitions should await the reference to the larger Bench, he added. \nThe review was earlier slated to be held on June 9, last year, with Chief Justice SA Bobde and Justice L Nageswara Rao also forming part of the Bench.\nHowever, in May 2017, a petition questioning the Centre’s notification to make Aadhaar mandatory for mid-day meals had been adjourned when Justice L Nageswara Rao recused, as he had earlier appeared for Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) as a lawyer. The decision to reschedule the June 9 hearing was also attributed to this factor.\nApart from Justice Rao, the Bench constituted which eventually heard the review also saw the substitution of Chief Justice Bobde. Instead, Justices Abdul Nazeer and BR Gavai were made part of the Bench.\nSenior Advocate Shyam Divan, appearing on behalf of the petitioners, had urged that the review against the verdict that upheld the constitutional validity of the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and other subsidies, benefits and services) Act, 2016 be heard in open court. However, the Court chose to list the matter to be heard in chambers.\nThe primary ground for challenging the correctness of 2018 judgment was that the Act was \"incorrectly certified as a Money Bill by the Speaker of the Lok Sabha.\"\nIt was further contended that the case of review involved important issues relating to the interpretation of the Constitution which requires oral submissions before an open court hearing.\nA Bench of then Chief Justice Dipak Misra and Justices AK Sikri, AM Khanwilkar, DY Chandrachud and Ashok Bhushan had passed its ruling in the Aadhaar case in September 2018, with Justice Chandrachud dissenting on the ground that passage of Aadhaar Act as money bill was a fraud on the Constitution."}

It further noted in its order,\n\"There is no doubt that the regulation of content has been a very contested issue across the world. India is no exception...While journalists cannot be asked to reveal sources, they need to ensure that the source ought to be authentic and a verifiable source... \"\nThe Court added, \n\"The media plays a very important role in ensuring there is no sensationalisation and that they indulge in responsible journalism. Recent coverage by the media definitely shows there is prejudicial and sensational journalism which is being undertaken by the media houses.\"\nJustice Singh further noted that the need of the hour was to strike a balance.\n\"In order to ensure that all three aspects of petitioner's privacy/dignity, sovereignty/integrity and free speech are equally protected and balanced, right of the individual has to be balanced with the right of public,\" the Court said.\nThe matter will be next heard on March 17.\nAppearing for Ravi today, Senior Advocate Akhil Sibal contended that the FIR lodged on February 4 does not mention the name of his client. He added that when she was arrested, no information was given to her family on whether production is going to happen. However, the media was present at the place of production in large numbers.\nSibal then told the Court that Times Now reported that Ravi \"broke down in court and said she edited only two lines\". On the same day, Sibal added, Delhi Police put out a tweet saying that Ravi did more that editing two lines, that she collaborated with a Khalistani organisation, and that she shared the toolkit with Greta Thunberg.\nHe accused the Delhi Police of making its case through its Twitter handle.\nThereafter, Sibal continued, a press briefing was held, following which the media began discussing WhatsApp chats allegedly sent by Ravi. The media had attributed this news to police sources, he said.\nReferring to a News18 report, he said that the person reporting in Hindi goes into detail on what questions were asked by the police, and what answers were given. The media also reported that Disha Ravi also coaxed Greta Thunberg into speaking on the case, Sibal informed the Court.\nWhen the Court asked Sibal if he was alleging that Delhi Police was responsible for leaks to the media, he said,\n\"They have in fact leaked, that is the only logical inference. The person broadcasting says I have got it from police forces. This is happening while I am being produced before the Magistrate.\"\nHe went on to refer to an India Today report with inbuilt commentary and inferences on the case.\nSibal then referred to a Central government circular advising police against press briefings in ongoing cases. In this circular, it was mentioned that such briefings should take place only at the stages of registration, arrest of accused, and chargesheeting, and should only be confined to the facts of the incident.\nAdditional Solicitor General SV Raju, appearing for Delhi Police urged the Court to adjourn the matter till Monday, assuring that no press conference would be held till then.\nJustice Singh then raised a query on media attributing leaks to police sources, while acknowledging that a journalist may not divulge sources. Raju replied,\n\"What media says may not be gospel truth. To hide his source, (media) may say it is the police...There are several persons interrogating, somebody may leak it. There may be ten persons interrogating, a peon may leak...\"\nHe added,\n\"We don't intend to do anything that is illegal. Leaking is illegal.\"\nRaju then pointed out that there were certain statements made to malign the police.\n\"If we counter that and we hold a press conference, there cannot be any violation of guidelines.\" \nHe added that the bar on leaking should be applicable to both sides.\nThe ASG further contended that the writ petition has been filed to put pressure on and malign the police, and to hamper the investigation.\nAdvocate Nisha Bhambhani, appearing for News Broadcasting Standards Authority (NBSA), stated that no complaint was received by the NBSA and if any complaints had been received, NBSA would have taken action.\nWhen counsel for News18, advocate Mrinal Bharti sought some time to file a reply, the Court observed,\n\"There is no doubt that the video is very, very sensational.\"\nAdvocate Hrishikesh Baruah, appearing for India Today, said that the article in question was not a news broadcast at all. \n\"This is only digital news online article...therefore Cable TV Network Act, programme code has no application...\"\nThe Court noted that the issue raised is the WhatsApp messages being attributed to Ravi by these news channels. On this point, Raju contended,\n\"If you reveal WhatsApp chats at the stage of charge sheet, there is no violation of privacy. It is in favour of ensuring investigation that it is not revealed at this stage (before chargesheet).\"\nSibal countered,\n\"There is a difference between the public record and the public domain. Merely saying that 'something is wrongfully disseminated in public domain so I must not be restrained from disseminating it further' is wrong.\"\nHe went on to say,\n\"How do we stop this?

The public interest litigation (PIL) petition was filed by athlete Mahendra Kumar Mohanty.\nThe Court said the distinction is a result of variation in salary and resources available to government employees, as compared to privately-employed persons. It also rejected the argument that such facilities are exclusively reserved for ‘elite government servants’.\nWhile observing that determination of membership fee of a golf course depends on factors like operational costs, maintenance and other logistical considerations, the Court said,\n“It is crucial to recognize that the sport in discussion – golf – demands meticulous and regular maintenance of its courses, which undeniably requires substantial resources. These upkeep necessities inevitably lead to the levy of high membership or user fees”.\nThe PIL challenged the membership criteria issued by Delhi Development Authority (DDA) for the Mehrauli-located golf course.\nThe division bench said Mohanty’s submissions seemed to heavily endorse the notion that the facilities should be availed at no cost since the golf course is established on government land.\nHowever, it said the fixed membership charges are not arbitrary but aimed to strike a balance between providing top-notch facilities and maintaining them.\n“The mere fact that the DDA falls under the aegis of the government does not absolve it from financial practicalities. Generating revenue, in this case through membership fees, is indispensable to ensure that the golf course remains in prime condition and continues to offer premier facilities to its members,” the Court observed.\nThe petitioner appeared in person. \nAdvocate Ajay Digpaul, Amit Gupta, Kamal Digpaul, Swati Kwatra, Saurabh Tripathi, Vikramaditya Singh and Ghanshyam Jha represented the Union of India\nStanding Counsel Sanjay Katyal and Advocate Nihal Singh represented the Delhi Development Authority."}
{"ID": "id_1621", "Summary": "The Madhya Pradesh High Court held that the Chief Minister’s social media posts cannot be equated with an administrative order or instruction and every social media post of a government functionary is not necessarily seen, read and followed in the administrative hierarchy. (Sonu Bairwa Vs. State of M.P.)\nHence, a detention order passed by District Magistrate cannot be considered as having passed “under dictate” of the CM unless a clear nexus can be established between the detention order and social media post, the Court ruled.\nThe observations were made by a Bench of Justices Sujoy Paul and Anil Verma while hearing a plea by one Sonu Bairwa who was detained on orders from the District Magistrate under the National Security Act, 1980 (NSA) for indulging in black marketing of Remedesivir injections. \nCounsel for the Petitioner, advocate Mudit Maheshwari drew the Court’s attention to multiple social media posts of the Chief Minister expressing that persons indulging in black marketing of Remedesivir injections shall be detained under the NSA.\nIn view of these posts, it was argued that the District Magistrate was acting \"under dictate\" while passing the order for detention.\nHowever, the Court found the contention lacked substance and remarked that social media posts cannot be equated with an administrative order. \nThe Bench also contemplated a situation where the argument made on behalf of the petitioner may hold merit stating, “had it been an executive instruction/order issued by higher functionary to act in a particular manner and in obedience thereof District Magistrate would have passed a detention order, perhaps the matter would have been different.”\nTherefore, the Court concluded that the District Magistrate has used his discretion in accordance with law and no interference of the High Court was warranted.\nInterestingly, the Delhi High Court had recently ruled that a promise, assurance or representation given by Chief Minister (CM) of a State amounts to an enforceable promise and the same has to be implemented by the government.\nAn assurance/promise given by the Chief Minister is enforceable, both on the basis of the doctrines of promissory estoppel and legitimate expectations, single-judge Justice Prathiba Singh had held."}
{"ID": "id_1623", "Summary": "The Jharkhand High Court last week quashed criminal proceedings against Chief Minister Hemant Soren accused of violating Model Code of Conduct (MCC) during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections [Hemant Soren v State].\nSoren had moved the High Court challenging the case against him under Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Section 130(e) of the Representation of People Act, 1951 which was pending before a Ranchi Court.\nWhile quashing the plea, single-judge Justice Sanjay Kumar Dwivedi noted that as per Section 195(1)(a)(i) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), a court can take cognizance of any offence punishable under IPC only on the complaint in writing of the public servant concerned.\n“In such peculiar circumstances, no FIR could have been registered by the Executive Magistrate for an offence punishable under Section 188 of IPC. The legislative intention appears to be clear from the language of section 195(1) of Cr.P.C. itself, which categorically prescribes that where an offence is committed under Section 188 of IPC, it would be obligatory for the public servant before whom such offence is committed, to file a complaint before the concerned Magistrate having jurisdiction to take cognizance of it,” the Court held.\nIn the first information report (FIR) filed by Executive Magistrate, it was claimed that on May 6, 2019, Soren had gone to a polling booth to cast his vote and had allegedly exhibited his party sign by wearing a 'patta' (scarf).\nThe same was against Model Code of Conduct and, thereby, the CM committed offence under section 130(e) of the Representation of People Act, 1951, the FIR stated.\nIn light of above, the Magistrate took cognizance of the offence. Aggrieved by same, Soren moved the High Court against the FIR.\nSoren's counsel argued that, there was no whisper of any allegation that in any manner he disobeyed any order promulgated by any public servant.\nThe Counsel further argued that Magistrate couldn't have taken cognizance of the case, as there was no complaint made to a magistrate for the offence under Section 188 IPC as per the mandate of Section 195(1)(a)(i) of the CrPC. \nConsidering the facts, the Court noted that, in the present case, the FIR lodged by the Executive Magistrate cannot be termed as a complaint (as defined under CrPC) given to the Magistrate in writing so as to give the power to the magistrate concerned to take cognizance of the offence.\n\"There must be a complaint by the public servant whose lawful order has not been complied with. The complaint must be in writing. The provisions of Section 195 CrPC are mandatory. Non-compliance with it would vitiate the prosecution and all other consequential orders. The court cannot assume the cognizance of the case without such complaint. In the absence of such a complaint, the trial and conviction will be void ab initio being without jurisdiction,\" the Court ruled. \nThe petitioner was represented by advocates Kaushik Sarkhel and Abhishek Singh while State was represented by Advocate Vandana Bharti. \nOn November 8, the Supreme Court had ruled in another case that public interest litigation petitions filed against Soren before the Jharkhand High Court alleging money laundering and irregularities in granting mining leases, were not maintainable."}

Every accused and his next of kin have a right to expect a free and fair investigation,\" the judge observed.\nNoting the numerous lapses on part of the Police in summoning Vishal first in a random case and then arresting him in a narcotics case, the judge said that a lump sum amount can be awarded for the said regularities, as a palliative. \n\"There is a need to remind ourselves that rights of individuals is the citadel of democracy and every violation would be an attack on civilized society. Thus, while the reliefs prayed for in the writ petition are denied, the Court awards compensation of ₹2 lakh to the entire family for the stigma, social embarrassment and indignity suffered by each of them and especially Vishal as also for destruction of evidence (CCTV footages),\" the judge ordered.\nSuch compensation, the judge said, is “a balm on the wound” for violation of human dignity and for the failure of the police to instill confidence that the investigation was fair, impartial and a quest for the truth. \nThe bench further ordered that the CCTV cameras should be installed within two months in all police stations and units of the Barrackpore City Police with at least one year back up capacity for the time being. It further ordered mandatory videography of seizure of commercial quantity of narcotics in all cases.\nThe Court was seized of a plea filed by Vishal's mother seeking his release. She claimed that her son was arrested at the behest of the ruling Trinamool Congress Party leaders as he supported the Congress Party. She claimed that on March 9, 2022 the Titagarh Police had picked up her son and he was shown to be arrested in a narcotics case on March 10, 2022.\nOn the other hand, the police contended that in February 2022 itself, a case was lodged under charges of criminal intimidation etc against Vishal and his associates for threatening one Ramesh Shaw of dire consequences. \nOn March 9, 2022, the complainant again informed the cops that Vishal threatened him and therefore, the police went to his house to meet him. However, due to non-cooperation and 'bad behaviour' they arrested him under Section 151 of Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC), which allows the police to arrest anyone, who is likely to commit a cognizable offence. \nIt further contended that he was let off on March 9 itself and on the wee hours of March 10, he was arrested in a separate case, based on a secret information it received. The police claimed that at the time of arrest Vishal was found with codeine mixture. \nNoting the contentions, the bench sought CCTV footage of the police station for March 9 and 10 as it was the specific contention of Vishal's family that their son was not let out of the police station on March 9 and was directly put in the lock-up on March 10.\nThe police, however, stated that it does not have the footage as the CCTV cameras are installed in a phased manner and their storage capacity is only of one month. \nJustice Sarkar in her order underlined that the right to life and personal liberty and also the right to dignity enshrined under Article 21 of Constitution of India have a much wider connotation and the right to fair and impartial investigation is an important ingredient of such right. \nResponsibility has been cast on the State as the guardian of law, and the court can play an active part to enquire whether such role had been discharged with responsibility. The State is always accountable to the citizens for any lapse, the judge emphasised.\n\"The police cannot arrest a person merely on an apprehension of the breach of peace or on an apprehension that an offence was likely to be committed. What is required under section 151 is that the officer concerned must have knowledge that the person was designing to commit a cognizable offence and in order to stop such attempt, arrest has to be made,\" the judge opined.\nThe sequence of events and the discrepancies and irregularities which have been pointed out indicate that the police authorities failed to discharge their duty in accordance with law, the Court made it clear.\n\"Disturbing features have been noticed by the court in the process of arrest of Vishal on March 9, 2022, and further arrest on March 10, 2022 for commission of offence under the NDPS Act. There is no evidence of his release apart from the two bonds. There are irregularities in the procedure adopted by the police,\" the bench held.\nIt further noted that with regard to the narcotics case, the police had already filed its chargesheet. It noted that in the instant petition, the petitioner did not challenge the FIR or the chargesheet filed in that case and therefore, there was no question of passing any orders in that respect.\nIt, therefore, only ordered payment of compensation to Vishal's family.\nSenior Advocate Pratik Dhar along with advocates Koustav Bagchi, Anirudhya Bhattacharyya, Debayan Ghosh, Priti Kar and Cardina Roy appeared for the Petitioner.\nSenior Standing Counsel Amitesh Banerjee along with advocates Ipsita Banerjee and Suddhadev Adak represented the State.\nDeputy Solicitor General Billwadal Bhattacharyya and advocate Kallol Mondal represented the CBI."}

All lawyers/advocates who are appearing on the criminal side for the accused or the prosecution cannot claim a right to own an arms licence, inasmuch as this could result in issuance of arms licenses indiscriminately,\" the Court observed.\nThe Court was hearing a plea by advocate Shiv Kumar challenging an order of the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi which rejected his application seeking a firearm license.\nAppearing in person, he relied on two judgments, one of the Delhi High Court in Vinod Kumar v. State and the other of the Gujarat High Court in Devshibhai Raydebhai Gadher v. State of Gujarat, to argue that if none of the grounds under Section 14 (Refusal of licences) of the Arms Act are established, the arms license would have to be issued.\nOn the other hand, the respondents, relying on the Delhi High Court's decision in Yashpal Singh v. Licensing Authority, argued that there can be no right to have an arms license, which is in effect a privilege.\nThe Court observed that the order passed by the licensing authority as well as the appellate authority showed that proper and due consideration was given to various facts placed by the petitioner.\nFurther, it observed that the perceived weakness of the State, which was one of the grounds which the petitioner urged for seeking the arms license, if accepted, would result in recognition of a right to own a firearm.\nThis recognition leading to issuance of a licence and unbridled owning of fire arms, could also pose a threat to the safety and security of the other citizens, the Court underscored.\nThe Court noted that the licensing authority has to assess the threat perception and the reasons for request for a licence which was been given by the concerned applicant. \nIn that background, it said that an application by an advocate merely based on the ground of appearance on behalf of accused persons would not be sufficient to grant an arms license.\nHence, the Court determined that the assailed order did not warrant interference and rejected the plea.\nAdvocates Vikrant N Goyal, Santosh Kr Tripathi, Arun Panwar, Pradyumn Rao and Mahak Rankawat appeared for the respondents."}

Therefore, the restriction was violative of Articles 19 (1) (g) and 21 of the Constitution.\nThe State, however, opposed the PIL on the grounds that Mathura and Vrindavan were prominent places with great historical and religious importance since they were the birthplace and Kreeda Sthal of Lord Krishna.\nIt was submitted that lakhs of devotees from India and abroad visit Mathura Vrindavan for holy darshan, blessings and virtuous upliftment. Thus, with a view to maintain the historical, religious, tourism importance and above all, the sanctity of the holy places, they were notified “Holy Place of Pilgrimage”.\nConsequently, the sale and purchase of meat, liquor and eggs was restricted. However, the petitioner had challenged neither of the orders notifying the same, the government pointed out. \nThe State also stressed that no fundamental right of the petitioner was infringed since only reasonable restrictions have been imposed.\nThe Court took this submission into account stating that since the government orders were not challenged, it would not dwell upon its legality.\n\"It is apparent that the Notification dated September 10, 2021 and the Government Order dated September 17, 2021 issued by the State government have not been impugned in the writ petition.

He doesn't actually have control over what they post and therefore, cannot be held vicariously liable for any posts put up by other members.\n\"As has been held by both the Bombay and Delhi High Courts, the only privilege enjoyed by the Admin of a WhatsApp group over other members is that, he can either add or delete any of the members from the group. He does not have physical or any control otherwise over what a member of a group is posting thereon. He cannot moderate or censor messages in a group.Thus, Creator or Administrator of a WhatsApp group, merely acting in that capacity, cannot be vicariously held liable for any objectionable content posted by a member of the group,\" the Court ruled.\nIn this case, the petitioner has been charged for offences under the Information Technology Act (IT Act) and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO Act). None of these provisions provide for vicarious liability and therefore, holding an admin liable for posts on a whatsapp group would go against basic principles of criminal law, the Court said.\n\"There is no law by which an Admin of any messaging service can be held liable for a post made by a member in the group. A WhatsApp Admin cannot be an intermediary under the IT Act. He does not receive or transmit any record or provide any service with respect to such record. There is no master-servant or a principal-agent relationship between the Admin of a WhatsApp group and its members. It goes against basic principles of criminal law to hold an Admin liable for a post published by someone else in the group. It is the basic principle of criminal jurisprudence that mens rea must be an ingredient of an offence and both the act and intent must concur to constitute a crime,\" the order made it clear.\nThe Court was considering a case where a member of a Whatsapp group had posted content depicting minors engaged in a sexual act. The petitioner was merely the creator and admin of the group.\nThereafter, he was arrayed as accused no.2, the person who posted the message being accused no.1.

The legal consequences and potential liability of the Administrator, stemming from such an objectionable post has come up for consideration in this Criminal Miscellaneous Case,\" the Court observed\nThe Court stated that generally, a person can be criminally liable for the acts of another if they are a party to the offence. Nowadays, strict vicarious criminal liability is somewhat of an exception to the general rule of direct personal culpability and is a modern development through statutory provisions. \nThe Court noted from various judgments of the Supreme Court that vicarious criminal liability can be fastened only by reason of a provision of a statute and not otherwise.\n\"In the absence of a special penal law creating vicarious liability, an Admin of a WhatsApp group cannot be held liable for the objectionable post by a group member,\" the order stated.\nConsidering the facts of the present case, the Court opined that there is nothing on record to suggest that the petitioner has published or transmitted or caused to be published or transmitted in any electronic form the alleged obscene material or he browsed or downloaded the said material or, in any way, facilitated abusing children online so as to attract Sections 67B (a), (b) or (d) of the IT Act.\nSimilarly, the prosecution has no case that the petitioner used children in any form of media for his sexual gratification or used them for pornographic purpose or stored, for commercial purpose, any child pornographic material in order to attract Sections 13, 14 or 15 of the POCSO Act. \nSince the basic ingredients of the offences alleged are altogether absent as against the petitioner, the Court deemed it fit to quash the proceeding against him."}

The compensation amount was sought to be enhanced by the appellants. \nAccording to the appellants, the deceased was driving a motorcycle and collided into a vehicle which was parked in the middle of the road without any signal or light indicator. As a result of the collision, he sustained fatal injuries and passed away at the hospital. \nThe deceased was around 54 years of age and was employed as a government contractor. The appellants had sought compensation to the tune of ₹50 lakh from the tribunal.  \nAccording to the respondents, the incident occurred due to the sole negligence of the deceased. \nThe High Court examined the eyewitness testimony to find that the accident undoubtedly occurred due to the irresponsible and negligent parking of the respondent’s vehicle in the middle of the road. \nIn the same breath, it was recorded that the accident could have been avoided if the deceased was driving with all due care while crossing the stationary bus. \nIn this regard, reliance was placed on the eyewitness testimony, who was travelling in another motorcycle behind the deceased, and categorically stated that he saw a DTC bus in the middle of the road.\n“Hence, if the deceased would have taken proper care, he would have also seen the DTC bus standing in the middle of the road and the unfortunate accident would have been avoided.”\nTherefore, while agreeing with the tribunal’s finding, the Court went on to increase the compensation on the ground of future prospects and loss of dependency among others. Despite the increase, the 20 per cent deduction for contributory negligence was upheld. \nThe total amount payable in terms of compensation was finally set at ₹33 lakh.\nAdvocate SN Parashar appeared for the appellants while the respondents were represented by Advocate Ravi Sabharwal."}

The complainant claimed that he spotted Khan riding a bicycle on the streets of Mumbai and asked his bodyguards for permission to film the actor. On obtaining consent, the complainant started recording an irked Khan, who set his bodyguards on the journalist and his cameraman who were riding in a car. The journalist claimed that Khan had even snatched his phone from him and deleted data from it.\nBased on the “positive police report” under Section 202 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) and other material, the magistrate found sufficient grounds to proceed against Khan.\nThe magistrate observed that offences under Section 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace), 506 (criminal intimidation) of  Indian Penal Code had been made out against Khan, and summoned him to personally remain present in court. \nThe High Court had stayed this order in April 2022. Khan also sought quashing of the complaint against him.\nJustice Dangre noted that the magistrate failed to follow the procedural mandate as contemplated under the Criminal Procedure Code before taking cognizance of the complaint.\nAnother glaring discrepancy according to Justice Dangre was the invocation of Sections 504 and 506 of IPC without being satisfied about the ingredients. \n“The words uttered in despair or a gesture, however frightful, by itself would not attract Section 504. The allegations against Khan in the complaint, apart from being an afterthought, in no case met the necessary ingredients of Sections 504 and 506, which would have warranted the Magistrate to take cognizance upon a complaint,” the Court held. \nThe judge proceeded to quash the orde,r noting that issuance of process against Khan and continuation of proceedings against him would be “nothing short of abuse of the process”.\nSenior Advocate Abad Ponda with Advocates Agasthya Desai and Vikram Sutaria appeared for Khan and his bodyguard.

{"ID": "id_1639", "Summary": "The Delhi High Court on Thursday refused to interfere with an order dismissing a judicial officer from service for accepting hotel bookings by an unknown person for a trip abroad [Naveen Arora v. High Court of Delhi]. \nJustices Manmohan and Saurabh Banerjee found that acceptance of payment from a “stranger” was unbecoming of a judicial officer, as the post was coveted and had responsibilities attached to it. \n“A Judicial Officer is expected to be unceremonious and not take things in an easy manner. A Judicial Officer is expected to be more prudent. At the end of the day “A Judge is a Judge who is always open to be judged”, read the judgment. \nThe Bench found that the judicial officer accepted the bookings from a “stranger” and that the same was not reasonably explained. This was sufficient for him to be held guilty. \n“Such acceptance can be in any form and need not always be quid pro quo and/or direct.”\nThe issue arose when the judicial officer travelled abroad along with his family. On his return, discrepancies were found in documents submitted by him to the High Court with regard to hotel bookings. \nOne Shyam Sunder Bajaj was found to have made payments towards his bookings.\nThis led to the appointment of an inquiry officer and initiation of proceedings against the judge. An inquiry report was filed, which was followed by an order of the Full Court dismissing the judicial officer from service. \nBefore the High Court, the judicial officer claimed there was no malafide on his part, as he did not withhold information about the payments. He also stated that he owed money to a friend and client of his younger brother for the bookings. \nHe submitted that he had offered money to the client in exchange for the hotel bookings before leaving for the trip. The person had assured him that he would accept the money only on their return, but later refused to accept the money. \nIt was further contended that the petitioner had not accepted a favour for discharge of his duties and it was not a case of quid pro quo. Even otherwise, the person in question was residing in Singapore and there was no situation in which the petitioner could oblige him.\nThe Court began by recording that the inquiry officer had all followed principles of natural justice at all stages. \nAdditionally, the Bench noted that the judicial officer had failed to give a material response to repeated queries put by the High Court since the inception. \n“There are too many negatives which, unfortunately, do not add up to make a positive.”\nFurther examining the facts, the Court said that the petition neither inspired confidence nor appeals to reason.\n“The present is not a case of no evidence or perverse findings or that the findings arrived at by the Officer shock the conscience of the Court or such where there have been any procedural irregularities. On the contrary, the conclusion arrived by the Officer is well-reasoned and well-supported and plausible in the eyes of the law.”\nTherefore, on finding that there were multiple reasons tilting the balance against the judicial officer, the Court said it had little left to ponder over. \nThe Bench also rejected the argument that the punishment was disproportionate to the misconduct considering the past service record of the petitioner.\n“Considering the post of a Judicial Officer held by the petitioner, the charge of accepting money in the nature of a favour from a stranger is in itself serious and thus the penalty imposed is commensurate to the charge. We are afraid, no case of leniency calling for reduction of penalty imposed is made out,” the order reasoned.\nSenior Advocate Mukul Talwar along with Advocates Ankur Chhibber, Rajesh Sachdeva, Shobha Gupta, Vineet Budhiraja, Vivek Singh and Apurva appeared for the judicial officer while the High Court was represented by Advocates Rajat Aneja and Aditi Shastri."}
{"ID": "id_164", "Summary": "The Telangana High Court recently observed that when there is no corroborating evidence in a rape case involving a minor, the trial court must ascertain what the victim girl means by the word ‘rape’. [Kathula Vasu v. State of Telangana]\n“When the victim is a child and in one word, she states that ‘rape’ was committed, it would become imperative in such cases when there is no other corroborating evidence, to know from the victim girl as to what is meant by her narration of ‘rape’,” the Court said.\nJustice K Surender said that when the victim states that she was subjected to rape, the court may seek clarification from the victim by putting questions as contemplated under Section 165 of Indian Evidence Act.\n“The said understanding of the victim as to what is meant by word ‘rape’ by the Court concerned is for the reason of the specific requirements given under Section 3 of the [POCSO] Act of 2012 as to what constitutes penetrative sexual assault and what constitutes ‘rape’ under Section 375 IPC,” the judgment stated.\nThe Court made the observations while setting aside the conviction of an accused under Section 6 (aggravated penetrative sexual assault) of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.  \nInstead, the Court convicted the accused under Section 8 (sexual assault) of the Act and sentenced him to three years jail.\nThe convict had appealed against a trial court judgment by which he was sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment of 20 years for rape of the minor girl. His counsel argued there was no corroborative medical evidence in the case.\nOn the contrary, the prosecution argued that the victim's statement was sufficient to convict the accused. It was also submitted that since the rape had occurred 20 days before the lodging of complaint, the question of finding medical evidence did not arise.\nLooking into the victim’s statement in which she mentioned that the accused pressed her chest and “forcibly committed rape” on her, the Court said,\n“The use of word ‘rape’ by the victim girl in the present circumstances cannot be made sole basis for the Court to assume or draw inference that penetrative sexual assault had taken place”.\nThe Court said it is understandable to accept a victim’s statement on rape when she is a married woman or understands what constitutes rape. However, in the instant case, the Court opined there was nothing on record to show that the victim “had knowledge” about sexual act or what constitutes ‘rape’.\n\"When there is no corroborating medical evidence or any other oral corroborative evidence, the Court has to place reliance on the testimony of the victim. If the testimony inspires confidence of the Court, the sole testimony can be made basis to convict the accused. However, in the cases where a statement is made that the accused had committed ‘rape’, the Court has to be cautious before concluding that the offence of rape has been committed.\"\nIt added that the finding of court would result in sending a person to life imprisonment in such cases. Courts have to be more cautious and a duty is cast upon them to infer from the admissible evidence on record regarding the allegation of rape, the judge said.\nConcluding that prosecution had failed to prove the offence of aggravated penetrative sexual assault, the Bench said that it cannot be held that the victim was raped.\nHowever, since the victim had mentioned about accused pressing her chest and waist, the Court said it clearly fell within the definition of sexual assault under POCSO Act.\nAdvocate MV Venu represented the petitioner."}

Central Bureau Of Investigation.\n\"We have held we do not agree with Asian resurfacing....There cannot be automatic vacation of stay,\" the Court held.\nThe Court, therefore, set aside the directions in the 2018 judgment in the Asian Resurfacing case in which a three-judge bench of the top court had directed that all stay orders in criminal as well as civil proceedings would be valid only for six months unless specifically extended.\nThe Court said that it is unable to concur with the directions issued in paragraphs 36 and 37 of the decision in the Asian Resurfacing case.\n\"A direction (that) stay of all interim orders passed by the High Court automatically expires with lapse is something which cannot be issued under Article 142. Constitutional courts should refrain from laying down time bound schedules for cases pending before any other courts,\" the Supreme Court said.\nSuch directions for timebound decisions should be issued only in exceptional circumstances, the Constitution bench further said.\nThe bench had reserved its judgment in the case on December 13, 2023. Notably, none of the counsel who appeared in the matter supported the automatic vacation of stay orders.\nThe Supreme Court too had expressed reservations about the Asian Resurfacing judgment, although it had acknowledged the drawbacks of prolonging stay orders.\nThe bench had then requested Attorney General R Venkataramani or Solicitor General (SG) Tushar Mehta to assist it in the matter.\nSolicitor General Mehta had contended that a continuing judicial mandamus (from the Supreme Court) cannot be used to curtail the discretion of High Courts.\nSenior Advocates Rakesh Dwivedi and Vijay Hansaria also appeared in the matter.\nIn its judgment today, the Court said that the pattern of pendency of cases in every court including High Courts is different and hence, any out-of-turn priority for certain cases is best left to the concerned court.\n\"Constitutional Courts should not normally fix a time-bound schedule for disposal of cases pending in any Court ... The orders fixing the outer limit for the disposal of cases should be passed only in exceptional circumstances to meet extraordinary situations,\" the judgment said.\nThe bench stressed that application of mind is an essential part of any decision-making process.\n\"Without application of mind, an order of interim stay cannot be vacated only on the ground of lapse of time when the litigant is not responsible for the delay. An interim order lawfully passed by a Court after hearing all contesting parties is not rendered illegal only due to the long passage of time ... If such an approach is adopted, it will be completely contrary to the concept of fairness.\" \nNo litigant should be allowed to suffer due to the Court's fault, which is duty-bound to rectify its mistakes including the directions in Asian Resurfacing that virtually amounted to judicial legislation. \n\"Only the legislature can provide that cases of a particular category should be decided within a specific time ... Ideally, the cases in which the stay of proceedings of the civil/criminal trials is granted should be disposed of expeditiously by the High Courts. However, we do not live in an ideal world.\"\nThe High Courts cannot be expected to decide on a priority basis or a day-to-day basis only those cases in which a stay of proceedings has been granted while ignoring others, it was underscored.\nThe top court stressed that more well-off litigants cannot be allowed to take advantage of constitutional courts, or have High Courts decide their cases in a fixed timeline.\n\"Not every litigant can easily afford to file proceedings in the constitutional Courts. Those litigants who can afford to approach the constitutional Courts cannot be allowed to take undue advantage by getting an order directing out-of-turn disposal of their cases while all other litigants patiently wait in the queue for their turn to come. The Courts, superior in the judicial hierarchy, cannot interfere with the day-to-day functioning of the other Courts by directing that only certain cases should be decided out of turn within a time frame. In a sense, no Court of law is inferior to the other.\"\nThe apex court is is not superior to the High Courts in the judicial hierarchy, it added.\n\"The Judges of the High Courts should be allowed to set their priorities on a rational basis. Thus, as far as setting the outer limit is concerned, it should be best left to the concerned Courts unless there are very extraordinary circumstances.\"\nAll the same, applications for vacating interim reliefs cannot be kept pending for too long by keeping it pending with the main case, it was made clear. \n\"If an ad-interim order continues for a long time, the affected party can always apply for vacating ad-interim relief. The High Court is expected to take up even such applications on a priority basis. If an application for vacating ex-parte ad interim relief is filed on the ground of suppression of facts, the same must be taken up at the earliest.\"\nIn conclusion, the apex court clarified that in the cases in which trials have been concluded as a result of the automatic vacation of stay, the same shall remain valid."}

One such committee had been constituted to check the affairs of 609 madrassas that were receiving state aid.\n\"Surprisingly, the government, be it for whatever reason, is shying away from placing on record the result of enquiry conducted by these committees,\" the Court found.\nThe Court opined that there was no sufficient explanation why the enquiry was not completed within a time-bound period, more so when the government itself, way back in 2020, cancelled the grant of aid to at least 88 educational institutions in district of Sitamarhi alone.\nThe bench, therefore, ordered that the enquiries already taken up committees should be expedited and completed within four weeks' time.

In the facts of this case, the private interest claimed by the petitioner does notprevail over the public interest which would subserve Infrastructural Project of public importance which is a dream project of this country and first of its kind\", the order said.\nSenior Advocate Navroz Seervai, appearing for Godrej & Boyce, sought status quo so that the company could file an appeal before the Supreme Court. \nHowever, the High Court refused to grant the same.\nThe plea by Godrej and Boyce challenged an award of compensation passed on September 15, 2022 by the Deputy Collector for acquiring the company's land after awarding compensation of ₹264 crores.\nThe application by the company claimed that the entire proceedings initiated in 2019 for land acquisition had lapsed in 2020 and, hence, the award passed by the officer was void ab initio.\nThe plea also challenged the amendment to the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act after which the bullet train project had been exempted from social impact assessment carried out by experts.\nSeervai, appearing for Godrej & Boyce, had contended during the hearing of the case that there were \"multiple and patent illegalities\" in the acquisition.\nSeervai had prayed for a stay on the proceedings arguing that national interest cannot be cited as ground to deny urgent interim reliefs.\nOn the other hand, former Advocate General Ashutosh Kumbhakoni, on behalf of the State acquisition authority, had told the Bombay High Court that the land acquisition for the project was complete except for the land owned by Godrej & Boyce company.\nHe had also argued that there was no violation of fundamental rights of Godrej & Boyce, and hence the writ petition challenging the acquisition of land ought to be dismissed.\nHe had apprised the Court about a suit filed by the State claiming title over the land, which Godrej & Boyce disputed.\nDespite the suit, the State offered to pay compensation, he had said, clarifying that if the title of the land goes in the State's favour, it would seek a return of the compensation paid. \nAdditional Solicitor General Anil Singh had argued that acquisition of land in Gujarat was already complete and work had also commenced, while in Maharashtra, they had completed acquisition of only 97% of land.\nHe had highlighted that it was lands owned by parties like Godrej & Boyce that were pending for acquisition.\nHe had also submitted that Godrej's petition was only causing delay to a project of public and national importance, and that such delay could possibly lead to escalation in the costs of the project. \nSingh has said that if compensation was a concern, then higher compensation could be considered and then granted, but the project ought not suffer any further."}

Despite any number of opportunities belonging to reserved category of SC/ST/OBC against the general category posts, the given percentage of reservation has to be proceeded in addition,” the judgment stated.\nThe case at hand concerned the recruitment of hostel welfare pfficers to the Social Welfare and Tribal Welfare Department in Krishna district, Andhra Pradesh.\nThe petitioner-candidates were not selected for the post, despite scoring higher marks than the last ranked person selected under the general or unreserved or open category.\nThe Court rejected arguments by the State authorities that the selection of the writ petitioners under the general category would violate a 1975 Presidential Order that had called for prioritising the appointment of local candidates to 80 per cent of the posts.\nThe Court noted that the writ petitioners were anyway local candidates from Krishna district. \nIt added that the reservation extended to Backward Classes or Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe candidates was not inconsistent with the Presidential Order. \nAs such, the Court concluded that there would be no violation of the Presidential Order in appointing the petitioners to the open category posts.\n\"The selected meritorious candidates (writ petitioners)…are the local candidates. So their shifting in the open category, based on their merit under 80%, would not reduce 80% for locals. That 80% would still be intact, only for locals…‘Reservation‘, does not only mean to follow the % of reservation fixed for the respective categories, but also the manner in which such reservation is to be implemented,” the judges held.\nThe Court proceeded to allow the writ petitions and asked the State authorities to appoint the petitioners under the unreserved category.\nHowever, the judges also ordered that the earlier appointments made back in 2011 should not be disturbed given that these appointees had now been in service for many years and were not at fault in the matter.\nAdvocates N Ravi Prasad and S Satyanarayana Rao appeared for the petitioners. \nGovernment Pleader Sumathi and Standing Counsel T Balakrishna appeared for the Social Welfare Department and the Andhra Pradesh Public Service Commission respectively."}

[Aji Krishnan v Union of India & Ors.].\nThe plea by Aji Krishnan also sought orders for the Court to monitor the probe conducted by the two Central agencies.\nJustice Bechu Kurian Thomas dismissed the petition on the ground that there was no basis for the apprehension expressed by the petitioner that the investigation by the two agencies will not be fair and proper.\n“On an appreciation of the above circumstances, it is evident that even the very apprehension expressed by the petitioner regarding the non-conduct of a fair and proper investigation is without any basis. The Customs as well as the Enforcement Directorate, have conducted or are conducting proper investigations. There are also no reasons to assume that if the involvement of any person is revealed in the investigation, they will not be proceeded against. For, the dictum “Be you ever so high, the law is above you” applies with equal vigour to all, irrespective of status or position,” the Court said.\nThe gold smuggling case dates back to July 2020, when pursuant to investigations conducted by various agencies into money laundering, illegal financial transactions and massive gold smuggling through diplomatic channels, suspected offenders were arrested and interrogated in Kerala.\nThe National Investigation Agency (NIA) filed a charge-sheet against 20 persons accused in the case, including Sarith PS and Swapna Suresh, under various sections of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.\nThe offences registered by the NIA and Customs were scheduled offences under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).\nIn the present case, the petitioner contended there was no serious investigation conducted even though Suresh made various revelations in her statement regarding the involvement of several persons holding constitutional posts in the State.\nThe petitioner further contended that the Customs didn’t take any action even after Suresh at various press conferences and in interviews, spoke about the alleged involvement of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan.\nAdvocate General of Kerala , Senior Advocate K Gopalakrishna Kurup assisted by Public Prosecutor P Narayanan objected to the maintainability of the petition.\nThe Court said that the present petition was liable to be dismissed as there were already two judgments (Michael Varghese v.

{"ID": "id_1656", "Summary": "The Andhra Pradesh High Court on Tuesday quashed a First Information Report registered in connection with Amaravati land scam. \nThe Court held that the petitioners purchased the lands, in exercise of the said constitutional and legal right and acquired property from the sellers who willingly and voluntarily sold them to the petitioners for a valid sale consideration under registered sale deeds. \nSuch private sale transactions cannot, therefore, be criminalized and no criminal liability can be attributed to the petitioners in the facts and circumstances of the case to prosecute them for any offences. \nThe allegation against the petitioners/ accused was that they had insider knowledge that Amaravati would be chosen as the site for the new capital of divided Andhra Pradesh. They, therefore, bought lands in and around the proposed capital city at cheap prices before the official announcement to build the new capital at Amaravati was announced. \nThe Court, however, held that petitioners have no legal obligation to disclose the information relating to latent advantages in purchasing the land to the sellers at the time of buying the said land. \nTherefore, it does not amount to dishonest concealment of fact as contemplated under the Explanation appended to Section 415 IPC, it was held. It does not amount to any deception under Section 420 IPC read with Section 415 IPC, the Court added. \nThe Court also said that the sellers did not sustain any loss on account of the said sale transactions and no element of criminality was involved in the sale transaction.\nTherefore, the allegations set out in the F.I.R. coupled with the material collected during the course of investigation so far done, do not make out any case or constitute any offences under Sections 420, 406, 409 and 120-B of IPC. No offence of conspiracy to do any illegal act or to commit an offence is made out from the facts of the case.\nHence, the Court invoked its inherent powers under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to quash the FIR."}

She also prayed that an adequate experience letter and relieving letter be passed in favour of the law firm. \nIn response, the law firm pleaded that the suit was liable to be dismissed for not being maintainable. It was contended that a suit for specific performance of service contract was not maintainable and therefore, the remedy, if any, would only be in form of a suit for declaration with damages.\nThe law firm also stated that the Court was not empowered to evaluate the service record of an employee and to dictate the nature of experience certificate to be issued to such an employee.\nThe Court was also informed that the law firm had already instituted a suit for recovery of damages against the senior associate in the Courts at Bangalore, and lodged an FIR. \nThe senior associate clarified that she was not claiming reinstatement in the law firm and did not seek specific performance of her contract of personal services.\nThe suit is in form of getting an honourable discharge from the services of the law firm, it was stated. \nIn view of the submissions, the Court observed that the senior associate's suit could not be said to be one claiming declaration alone without any consequential relief. However, consequential relief need not be only in form of damages, the Court added. \n\"It is for the employee to seek the consequential relief in the form that he/she would be entitled to in accordance with law. Damages is not the only nature of consequential relief that can be sought by an employee,\" the Court said. \nThe Court further noted that the senior associate was not seeking specific performance of her contract of service. It also opined that the impact of the Bangalore suit for damages and the FIR would be considered by the trial court while deciding the suit. \n\"Whether the Suit has been rendered infructuous by any subsequent event, is to be determined by the learned Trial Court once the parties lead their evidence in that regard. Equally, whether prayer (c) (for experience letter etc) can or cannot be granted eventually, cannot lead to partial rejection of the plaint under Order VII Rule 11 CPC. As has been repeatedly held, there cannot be partial rejection of the plaint under Order VII Rule 11 of the Code.\"\nTherefore, finding no infirmity in the impugned order, the petition was dismissed with costs of Rs 35,000 payable to the senior associate. \nLaw firm was represented by advocates Sujoy Kumar, Raghav Kumar, Arindam Ghosh.\nSenior Associate was represented through advocates Dr. Amit George, Alex Joseph, P Harold, Rayadurgam Bharat, Amol Acharya."}

The order of taking cognizance of the final report in crime number 251/1994 and further proceedings pursuant to the same including the proceeding in CC 811/2014 on the file of Judicial First Class Magistrate is quashed. However, it is clarified that this would not preclude the competent authority or the court concerned from taking up the matter and pursuing the prosecution in compliance with the procedure contemplated under section 195 (1)(b) of the CrPC,\" the order said.\nThe Court emphasised that the case would have to be dealt with strict vigor since the allegation raised are of a serious nature pointing to interference with judicial functions.\n\"Though this court interfered in the proceedings for technical reasons, it cannot be ignored that the allegations raised are serious in nature. The materials placed before the court reveal allegations of such nature that interfere with the judicial functions and thereby, procuring the mechanisms of administering justice. Such acts required to be dealt with with strict vigor and this court expect a positive and effective follow-up action from the authorities concerned to ensure that a fair trial in accordance takes place and the culprits are punished adequately,\" the Court explained.\nTherefore, the Court directed the registry to take necessary action without any further delay.\n \"Hence, the registry of this court is directed to take appropriate action in this regard according to relevant provisions of the CRPC as referred above without any delay by taking note of the fact that offenses were allegedly committed in the year 1990 and any further delay in the matter would defeat the entire process,\" the Court ordered.\nThe particulars of the case dates back to the year 1990 when Raju was a junior lawyer representing an Australian man, Andrew Salvatore Cervelli, who was accused of smuggling hashish to India by concealing it in his underwear.\nWhen Cervelli approached the High Court in appeal against his conviction by a trial court over 30 years ago, the underwear in question was found to have mysteriously shrunk in size, leading the High Court to acquit Cervelli of all charges.\nA few years later, the investigating officer in the smuggling case, approached the High Court seeking a probe into the alleged evidence tampering. Subsequently a first information report (FIR) was registered against Raju in 1994 on a complaint filed by the Sheristadar of Sessions Court, Thiruvananthapuram.\nAfter 12 years of investigation, in 2006, the Assistant Commissioner of Police filed a charge sheet before the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Thiruvananthapuram alleging offenses under sections 120(B) (criminal conspiracy), 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 201(causing disappearance of evidence of offence), 193, 217, and 34 of the IPC.\nIt was Raju's argument that the crucial piece of \"underwear evidence\" was in the custody of the trial court while it was allegedly tampered with and, therefore, it should have been the court in question that initiated the proceedings to look into the same. However, in this case, the proceedings were initiated on the complaint of the police.\n\"However, in the case of the petitioner, the prosecution has been initiated by the Police and not by the Court, which is per se illegal and the Court has no jurisdiction to take cognizance of the offense if the complaint is not by the Court, as the offense is alleged is section 193 of the IPC,\" the plea said.\nHe submitted that section 195 CrPC creates a bar in taking cognizance of the complaint filed by the Police and no court shall take cognizance of the offence under section 193 of the Indian Penal Code except upon a complaint filed by the Court.\n\"Admittedly the court took cognizance of the matter upon a charge sheet by the police and the police have no authority to conduct an investigation in such cases and file a charge sheet before the court. Thus the proceedings pending before the court is nonest in the eye of law,\" the plea stated.\nFurther, it was argued that sections 340 and 341 CrPC state that the court is not bound to make a complaint regarding the commission of an offense referred to in section 195(1)(b), as the court must judge if the same has a significant impact on the administration of justice.\n\"There are patent illegalities in the procedures adopted by the administration wing of this Hon'ble Court, by the Sessions Court, Thiruvananthapuram and the Police in the matter, and same has commenced and completed ignoring the bar created under the s. 195 (1) (b) of the Code and procedure stated in Section 340 of the Code,\" the plea stated.\nAntony Raju was represented by advocates Deepu Thankan, Ummul Fida, Lakshmi Sreedhar, R Rajanandini Menon and Shahnas KP."}

He can appear in November for the whole set of exams.\nWe disapprove of the suggestion by ICAI that candidate will not be permitted to opt out if change of centre is within the same city. We direct that ICAI shall permit candidates to opt out in case of last minute change of centre, and the same shall not be treated as an attempt.\nAppearing for the petitioners, Senior Advocate Meenakshi Arora argued that the note submitted by the Institute for Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) was not in line with what the Court observed during yesterday's hearing.\n\"Opt out option has to be given to those who suffered from COVID-19 or if their family members suffered from COVID-19. The ICAI note does not capture it,\" she said.\nArora also brought up grievances with regard to the lack of option to change exam centre within the same city, the mandated 'no risk status' on the Aarogya Setu app for invigilators, and insistence on RT-PCR negative report for candidates.\nThroughout the hearing, the Court made it clear that its consideration would only be limited to preparing a scheme for opting out of the exams.\nOn the request to allow CA candidates to resume writing papers that are pending as opposed to starting the whole cycle afresh, the Court said,\n\"We will not tweak with the rules. You have to appear for the whole group if you miss a paper.

The certificate may be issued by a District Medical Officer, Primary Health Centres, Government General Hospitals, Private Hospitals and Registered Medical Practitioners.\nHowever, the ICAI made it clear that such medical certificate will be in addition to the relevant RT-PCR Report.\nThis choice would be in addition to the current option for opt-out which is available in case the examinee or his family members residing in the same premises are infected with COVID-19 on or after June 21, 2021 till the completion of the examinations.\nFurther, opt-out will be given in case there are any last minute changes in the examination centre due to operational or logistical reasons,. However, this would be applicable only in case of inter-city change. No opt-out option will be given where the change does not involve change of city.\nICAI further submitted that it is not possible to waive off articleship since it is a way of on-the-job training to equip the students with the skills required in the practical aspects of the profession.\n\"It is a statutory requirement as per the Regulation. There is flexibility of completion of articleship as per the discretion of the Principal professional under whom the student is undergoing training.

{"ID": "id_1664", "Summary": "Sitting judge of Pakistan Supreme Court, Justice Qazi Faez Isa and his spouse, Sarina Faez Isa appeared and successfully argued their case in-person before a 10-judge Bench of Pakistan Supreme Court [Justice Qazi Faez Isa v. President of Pakistan].\nThe arguments were made in a review petition filed by them against the top court’s earlier judgment which had ordered Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) to conduct an inquiry into the non-disclosure of three foreign properties of Justice Isa's family members - spouse and children - in the declaration of his assets filed with the annual income tax returns.\nBy way of its 45-page judgment, the Court not only allowed the review petition by a majority of 6:4, but also stressed on the importance of judicial accountability while at the same time emphasising the significance of ensuring independence of judiciary.\nThe opening sentence of the judgment declared that “no one, including a judge of the highest court in the land, is above the law”.\nAt the same time, no one, including a judge of the highest court in the land, can be denied his right to be dealt with in accordance with law, the Court underlined.\n“Every citizen of Pakistan, notwithstanding his status or position, is entitled to due process of law in any action detrimental to his life, liberty, body, reputation or property under Article 4 of the Constitution and safeguarding of his fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 9 to 28 of the Constitution,” the Court said.\nPertinently the Court said that “if the officers of the Federal or Provincial governments or of the autonomous bodies or authorities under the control of such governments are allowed or empowered to file complaints concerning or emanating from their official actions against judges of the constitutional courts who, in exercise of their constitutional jurisdiction, make judicial review of official actions and inactions of such officers, there would be disastrous consequences for the independence of judiciary.”\nSome of the other highlights of the judgment are as follows:\n- While judicial accountability is the cornerstone of judicial independence, it does not mean that accountability of a judge is bereft of due process of law and fair trial guaranteed under the Constitution;\n- An open court-house is no less than a glass house, yet the judges boldly and courageously uphold the law even against the mightiest in the land, without fear and favour, in full public gaze. In doing so, they step on many a toes and rattle many a skeleton. This may at times, invite efforts to discredit them by creating doubts about their personal integrity;\n- Since judges have no public platform to clarify, respond or defend themselves, such efforts go beyond the person of the judge and undermine public trust and public confidence in the judicial institution;\n- Constitutional safeguard of due process to enjoy the protection of law and to be treated in accordance with law, therefore, assumes even greater significance in the case where integrity of a judge is in question;\n- Unfortunately our chequered history has seen numerous attempts to trample upon judicial independence during both, civilian as well as military governments. Nonetheless, we must not become prisoner of our past and must now obviate any attempt to damage the judiciary;\n- Any attempt to muffle judicial independence or to stifle dissent shakes the foundation of a free and impartial judicial system, thus eroding public confidence on which the entire edifice of judicature stands.\nThe President of Pakistan, on advice of the Prime Minister of Pakistan, had filed a reference under Article 209 of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan 1973 (Constitution) against Justice Isa in the Supreme Judicial Council of Pakistan (Council) to conduct inquiry against him, alleging misconduct by Justice Isa mainly on the basis of his non-disclosure of three foreign properties of his family members - spouse and children - in the declaration of his assets filed with the annual income tax returns under Section 116 of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 (ITO).\nThe Council commenced inquiry proceedings against Justice Isa, in the said reference. Justice Isa and many bar councils and bar associations of the country, challenged the action of filing the reference by the President and also the proceedings commenced on the basis of the same by invoking the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Pakistan.\nThe constitution petitions were allowed by the Supreme Court which quashed the reference filed against the petitioner and held that the process adopted in preparing the reference was fraught with illegalities of such scale and degree that amounted to mala fide in law and declared that the proceedings initiated by the Council on the basis of that reference, stood abated.\nThe Court left the matter of its alleged violation of Section 116(1)(b) of the ITO by Justice Isa to be determined in the first instance by the hierarchy of the concerned legal forums specified under the ITO. \nHowever, the Court, on its own, went on and directed the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, Islamabad (Tax Commissioner) to initiate proceedings against the family members of Justice Isa [but not against Justice Isa], under the ITO and directed the chairman of FBR to submit a report regarding the determination made in those proceedings by the Tax Commissioner to the secretary of the Council.\nThe secretary was directed to place the said report before the chairman of the Council and the Council was asked to consider it in the matter of Justice Isa, in exercise of its suo motu powers, as it may deem appropriate.\nThis judgment came to be challenged before Supreme Court by way of review petitions.\nThe Court in its judgment held that the direction by the Supreme Court to the chairman of FBR to submit report to the Council and asking the Council to consider that report for deciding to take any action against Justice Isa has the effect of directing the chairman to file a complaint in the Council against Justice Isa, in the form of report. These directions have effectively authorized the chairman to do an act which he is not empowered to do under the Constitution or law, the Court said.\nHe being an officer subordinate to the Federal government cannot make any complaint against a constitutional court judge directly to the Council; only the Federal government can do so and that too by the constitutional process of acting through the President, the Court held.\nIf such officers are allowed to file complaints about judges of Constitutional courts, it will have disastrous consequences for the judiciary, the Court maintained.\nImportantly, the Court also held that a judge cannot be held liable for unaccounted assets of their spouses and children.\n“Nothing is there in any law or in the Judges’ Code of Conduct which could possibly be stretched to hold a Judge liable for the conduct of his spouse and children, or for that matter of anybody else, without there being any evidence to connect him with, and hold him responsible for such conduct. Needless to remind the salutary principle of law that everybody is responsible for his own deeds or misdeeds, acts and omissions, and nobody incurs any liability on account of any wrong committed by any other person,” the judgment said.\nHence, the Court concluded that Supreme Court could not have referred the tax matter of Justice Isa’s wife, to the Council as the role and jurisdiction of the Council is limited to the matters relating to the conduct and capability of the superior court judges.\n“It is not mandated to delve into the affairs of someone who is not a judge of a superior court,” the review judgment held while allowing the plea."}
{"ID": "id_1666", "Summary": "The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) on Friday imposed fine of Rs. 15 crore on Mukesh Ambani and Rs. 25 crore on Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) for entering into a scheme of \"manipulative trades\" in 2007 respect of the sale of 5 percent of RIL stake in Reliance Petroleum Limited (RPL). \nThe market regulator ruled that twelve Agents appointed by RIL took short positions in the F&O Segment on behalf of RIL, while RIL undertook transactions in RPL shares in the cash segment.\nThe depressed settlement price due to manipulative trades resulted in profits on the said short positions which were then transferred by the agents back to RIL as per a prior agreement, the SEBI ruled. \nSEBI also concluded that Mukesh Ambani as the Managing Director of RIL was responsible for the manipulative activities of RIL. \nSEBI had already directed RIL in 2017 to disgorge an amount of Rs. 447.27 crore along with interest at the rate of 12% per annum from November 29, 2007 onwards till the date of payment. Further, RIL by that order was also prohibited from dealing in equity derivatives in the F&O segment of stock exchanges, directly or indirectly, for a period of one year from the date of that order.\nThe current order imposing penalty is in addition to the 2017 order. \nBy way of background, the Board of Directors of RIL passed a resolution on March 29, 2007 which inter alia approved the operating plan for the year 2007 - 08 and resource requirements for the next two years, i.e., approximately Rs. 87,000 crore. Thereafter, RIL decided to sell approximately 5% of its shareholding in RPL (i.e. upto 22.5 crore RPL shares) in November 2007.\nSubsequently, RIL admittedly appointed twelve agents, between October 30, 2007 to November 3, 2007, to undertake transactions in November 2007 RPL Futures (settlement period November 1 - November 29, 2007) on its behalf.\nDuring the period of November 1, 2007 to November 29, 2007, various transactions were undertaken by RIL in the Cash Segment and by RIL through the agents in the F&O Segment. From November 15, 2007 onwards, RIL’s short position in the F&O Segment constantly exceeded the proposed sale of shares in the Cash Segment.\nOn November 29, 2007, RIL sold a total of 2.25 crore shares in the Cash Segment during the last 10 minutes of trading resulting in fall in the prices of RPL shares, which also lowered the settlement price of RPL November Futures in the F&O Segment. RIL’s entire outstanding position of 7.97 crores in the F&O Segment was cash settled at this depressed settlement price resulting in profits on the said short positions held by agents.\nThe said profits were transferred back to RIL by the agents as per prior agreement.\n\"The above strategy undertaken by RIL has resulted in manipulation of settlement price of RPL November Futures and prices of RPL shares in the Cash Segment. I note that Noticee-2 (Mukesh Ambani), being the Managing Director of RIL, was responsible for the manipulative activities of RIL,\" the order passed by SEBI said. \nCompanies, SEBI underscored, should exhibit highest standards of professionalism, transparency and good practices of corporate governance, which inspires confidence of the investors dealing in the capital markets. \nAny attempt to deviate from such standards will not only erode the confidence of the investors but also affect the integrity of the markets, it said. \nSuch acts of manipulation have to be dealt sternly so as to dissuade manipulative activities in the capital markets, the SEBI ruled proceeding to impose fine on Ambani and RIL.\nTwo other entities, Navi Mumbai SEZ Pvt. Ltd. and Mumbai SEZ Ltd., which aided and abetted RIL by providing funds to one of the agents appointed by RIL, who in turn provided funds to other eleven agents for making the margin payments for the short positions in RPL November Futures, were also met with similar action by SEBI. \nNavi Mumbai SEZ Pvt. Ltd was fined Rs. 20 crore while Mumbai SEZ was handed down fine of Rs. 10 crore."}
{"ID": "id_1667", "Summary": "A girl, who is less than 3.5 years of age, cannot be expected to give exact description of her private parts, the Bombay High Court observed while upholding conviction of a person under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO Act) for raping the minor. \nSingle-judge Justice Bharati Dangre, therefore, dismissed an appeal filed by the accused challenging his conviction by a special judge in Mumbai for penetrative sexual assault under Section 6 of the POCSO Act and for rape under Section 376 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). \n\"A little girl of 3 ½ years who is not even introduced to her own organs, cannot be expected to give exact description of her private parts, but in her statement recorded u/s.164, she has categorically stated that her friend's father had touched her at the toilet place by his nails. The little girl further says that he is a bad uncle, “गंदेअंकल है“. When she deposed before the Court, she clearly stated that finger was put in her private part, as a result of which lot of blood came out. She was not surely in a position to exactly describe the incident, on account of her simplicity and purity, not yet spoiled by mundane affairs. This guileless innocent girl did not realize its seriousness, and that is why the doctor before whom she appeared for medical examination, deposed that she was normal, being unaware of the seriousness of the act forced upon her,\" the Court said.\nJustice Dangre noted how difficult it was for the special judge to record the version given by the minor victim during the trial, due to the victim’s age and lack of focus.\n“It cannot be expected from a little girl, barely four years old, to focus on the photograph and identify the person, specifically as a child of that age may not be able to focus on a point due to underlying anxiety or being distracted by external stimuli. In the case of this girl, the stressful situation, she was facing, may also be one of its cause”, the High Court noted. \nJustice Dangre concluded this after noting the special judge’s record which clarified that the victim had not been able to disclose the incident openly, but was whispering in her ears, while fiddling with things on the table while answering. \n“I do not think more responsible behaviour can be expected from a little girl of this age, and it must have been an ardous task for the Special Judge to extract her version, but she clearly described the act committed by the accused and denied that she was giving false statement,” the High Court observed.\nThe prosecution’s case was that in November 2017, the victim had been sexually outraged by the accused, her friend’s father who lived in the neighbourhood.\nIn the afternoon hours, while she was playing with her siblings, with her mother just around, she was taken to the house by the accused and he fingered her, as a result of which she started bleeding. The little girl rushed to her mother and took off her panty and went to toilet. She was unable to pass urine and was touching her private part and shouting in pain and agony. The mother noticed blood coming out and when she inquired, the victim disclosed to her that the accused had put his finger in her vagina.\nAfter a first information report (FIR) was registered the next day, the accused was arrested, chargesheeted and the trial was concluded after examination of 8 witnesses.\nThe trial court convicted him leading to the appeal before the High Court. \nThe High Court noted there was no reason to disbelieve the victim’s deposition before the trial court where the act had been attributed to the accused.\n“The girl is relatively ingenuous, not capable of understanding the consequences of the act to which she has fallen prey and that it amounts to an offence. There is no reason why the mother should tutor the child of tender age to be a participant in such a churlish act of which she complained,” the Court concluded. \nThe Court said that the deposition of the child along with the medical evidence established the guilt of the accused.\nJustice Dangre also said that by convicting the accused, the courts were trying to impose adequate punishment to the accused for causing trauma to the victim which could possibly have a long lasting impact. \n“Though the little girl could not be protected from the sexual offence committed upon her, the wheels of justice have been turned to her by convicting the appellant for the wrong which he has done resulting into a trauma which has remained unexpressed but may leave a long lasting impact upon her, and by imposing adequate sentence” the judge said in the 13 page order."}

{"ID": "id_1673", "Summary": "The Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) has to be completed within the 330-day deadline prescribed under the law, the Supreme Court ruled on Monday (Ebix Singapore v. Committee of Creditors of Educomp).\nThe Court held that since the 330 days outer limit of the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) under Section 12(3) of the IBC, including judicial proceedings, can be extended only in exceptional circumstances, \"this open-ended process for further negotiations or a withdrawal, would have a deleterious impact on the Corporate Debtor, its creditors, and the economy at large as the liquidation value depletes with the passage of time.\"\nThe National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) should therefore, while deciding IBC matters, respect the deadline prescribed by the legislature, a Bench headed by Justice DY Chandrachud held.\n\"We urge the NCLT and NCLAT to be sensitive to the effect of such delays on the insolvency resolution process and be cognizant that adjournments hamper the efficacy of the judicial process. The NCLT and the NCLAT should endeavor, on a best effort basis, to strictly adhere to the timelines stipulated under the IBC and clear pending resolution plans forthwith. Judicial delay was one of the major reasons for the failure of the insolvency regime that was in effect prior to the IBC. We cannot let the present insolvency regime meet the same fate,\" the judgment said.\nThe judgment was delivered on an appeal from a NCLAT judgment of July 2020.\nThe NCLAT had held that the application to withdraw from the Resolution Plan could not have been allowed since: (i) it was barred by res judicata; and (ii) the NCLT does not have jurisdiction to permit such a withdrawal.\nThis reasoning was under challenge in the present case. \nThe top court held that the Adjudicating Authority lacks the authority to allow the withdrawal or modification of the Resolution Plan by a successful Resolution Applicant or to give effect to any such clauses in the Resolution Plan.\n\"Adjudicating Authority under Section 31(2) of the IBC can only examine the validity of the plan on the anvil of the grounds stipulated in Section 30(2) and either approve or reject the plan. The Adjudicating Authority cannot compel a CoC to negotiate further with a successful Resolution Applicant,\" the top court ruled.\nThe Court further noted that if the Parliament intended to permit such withdrawals/modifications sought by successful Resolution Applicants as being beneficial to the economic policy, \"which it has sought to pursue while enacting the IBC, it would have prescribed timelines for setting the clock-back or directing immediate liquidation if the withdrawals occur after a certain period.\"\nFurther, permitting the Adjudicating Authority to exercise its residuary powers under Section 60(5) to allow for further modifications or withdrawals at the behest of the successful Resolution Applicant, would be in the teeth of the decision of the Supreme Court in Essar Steel.\n\"We hold that the existing insolvency framework in India provides no scope for effecting further modifications or withdrawals of CoC-approved Resolution Plans, at the behest of the successful Resolution Applicant, once the plan has been submitted to the Adjudicating Authority. A Resolution Applicant, after obtaining the financial information of the Corporate Debtor through the informational utilities and perusing the IM, is assumed to have analyzed the risks in the business of the Corporate Debtor and submitted a considered proposal. A submitted Resolution Plan is binding and irrevocable as between the CoC and the successful Resolution Applicant in terms of the provisions of the IBC and the CIRP Regulations,\" the judgment said."}
{"ID": "id_1674", "Summary": "The Allahabad High Court recently ruled that a person who has converted to a religion before the enactment of the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Act, 2021 would still have to comply with its provisions to validate a marriage performed after the anti-conversion law came into force [Smt Nikitia @ Najrana And Another v. State of UP And 3 Others].  \nThe Court made the observation while dealing with a plea for protection by a couple who had married in 2024 after one of the partners converted to Hinduism in 2017. \nIt rejected an argument made by the couple that no \"fresh conversion\" in compliance with the 2021 anti-conversion law was required since the religious conversion took place in 2017.\nJustice Kshitij Shailendra explained that the anti-conversion law envisages that if conversion is done in relation to the marriage of persons belonging to different religions, the parties have to ensure compliance with its provisions \"irrespective of any past event.\"\nThe Court added that past conversion may be a relevant fact during the district magistrate's inquiry under the 2021 Act. However, this in itself would not be substantive proof of a valid conversion to attach sanctity to a marriage performed after the 2021 Act came into force, the Court said. \n“Therefore, the concerned party to a proposed inter-faith/inter-religion marriage has to comply with the provisions of the Act,” it ruled.\nThe Court passed the order in a petition moved by a Hindu couple seeking directions against any interference with their marriage. \nCounsel for the State informed the Court that while the man belongs to the Hindu religion, the woman he has married was earlier a Muslim. In this context, he argued that unless the 2021 anti-conversion law is complied with, no sanctity could be attached to the marriage.\nHowever, counsel representing the petitioners submitted that the conversion certificate was issued in 2017 and the Act only came into existence in 2021. \nThus, he argued that provisions of the 2021 law would not be applicable. A conversion certificate issued by an Arya Samaj Mandir was produced before the Court.\nWhile analysing the anti-conversion law, the Court decided to focus on the purpose and object of the legislation.\n\"The more stringent the Law, the less is the discretion of the Court. Stringent laws are made for the purpose to achieve its objectives. This being the intendment of the legislature, the duty of the court is to see that the intention of the legislature is not frustrated.

However, at the end of the day, mere educational qualification is not the essential criteria which is required to be satisfied by a candidate to vote or to be elected,\" the judge observed.\nAn uneducated electorate has the right to elect one of them as their representative in the State Assembly, the judge added.  \n\"Hence, seen from such perspective, it cannot be said that even if there was some irregularity in the declaration regarding educational qualification of the private respondent (Majumder), the same would be regarded as improper acceptance of any nomination to vitiate his election itself,\" the Court held. \nIt further said that a nomination paper of a candidate cannot be rejected on the ground of any defect which is not of a substantial character.\n\"Educational qualification, not being an essential criterion for getting elected would not be a defect of a substantial character,\" the judge underscored. \nThe Court was hearing a plea filed by one Gopal Seth, who alleged that MLA Majumder faked his educational qualification during the 2021 Assembly elections. The petitioner claimed to have obtained the documents pertaining to Majumder's admission to class V under the Right to Information Act (RTI Act). \nHe contended that the present age of Majumder was 39 and his birth year was recorded as 1982 and therefore his expected year of admission in Class V was to be 1990-92. \nHowever, he pointed out that the records of the school's Admission Register for academic years 1989-90 to 1995-96, did not show any record of Majumder's studentship in the school.  \nThe bench, however, held that mere production of such document before the court, without anything else was utterly insufficient to come to the serious conclusion that Majumder faked his educational qualification. \n\"It is only a competent criminal court, which upon proper trial and adduction of evidence can arrive at the finding that there is sufficient material to show that Majumder practiced fraud on the ECI and the electorate,\" the judge held. \nHe further said that the document produced by the petitioner was not corroborated by any substantial material to clinch the allegation against Majumder beyond reasonable doubt. \nWith these observations, the Court dismissed the plea.\nSenior Advocate Kishore Dutta along with advocates Sanjib Dutta and Anindya Sundar Chatterjee appeared for the Petitioner. \nAdvocate Anuran Samanta represented the ECI. \nAdvocates Sk Md Galib and Sujata Mukherjee represented the State. \nAdvocate Arindam Paul represented MLA Swapan Majumder."}

{"ID": "id_1690", "Summary": "The Delhi High Court recently directed the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) to pay compensation of ₹9 lakh to an 80-year-old woman whose house was damaged due to water-logging and flooding during the monsoon [Leela Mathur v. MCD].\nThe High Court highlighted that it was the duty of the municipal corporation to ensure that there was no water-logging by constructing proper storm water drains. The Bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice Subramonium Prasad said,\n“MCD cannot pass the buck to the residents to contend that since the storm water drains are clogged nothing can be done by the MCD. It has, therefore, woefully failed in discharging its duties inasmuch as it has admittedly laid down roads one over the other thereby increasing the height of the roads which ought not to have been done. MCD has also not ensured that there are proper storm water drains in the area so that the rain water can be drained away.\"\nThe Court was hearing an appeal by octogenarian Leela Mathur, who was previously awarded compensation of ₹3 lakh by a single-judge in 2010. She sought enhancement of the compensation amount, given that she would have to spend ₹21 lakh on repairing the damage caused by the water-logging.\nMathur said that when she had constructed her house in a West Delhi neighbourhood, it was at the same level as the road. However, after reconstruction carried out by the civic body, the level of the road kept rising, which eventually led to the flooding of her house during the monsoon.\nThe senior citizen also stated despite her requests to resolve the issue, the civic authorities chose to pay no heed.\nOn taking note of the Delhi Jal Board's submission that obtaining a sewerage connection alone will not remedy the issue of water-logging, the Court said,\n\"Ensuring that the public drainage system is fully functional, and avoiding the blockage of sediments causing chocking of drain is the prerogative of the MCD. It is unfortunate that not only has the MCD created the issue of water-logging but also exacerbated the situation by not taking appropriate measures to avoid chocking of drains during monsoon.\"\nThe Bench was not impressed with MCD’s argument that since the colony where Mathur resided was unplanned, and subsequently regularised, the road repairs were on a “as is where is basis”.\nThe “apathy” of the municipal corporation was stated to be “writ large” given the submission that the civic body lacked funds to compensate Mathur. The Bench noted in this regard,\n“A municipal corporation constituted for the precise purpose of providing basic amenities to the citizens cannot shirk off responsibility on the ground that the society was once unauthorised. It is evident that since then, the government of NCT Delhi has regularised these societies with an aim to include them within the development plans of the city.\"\nGiven that MCD was grossly negligent in its conduct, the Court had to step in to do complete justice to the appellant, who would have to incur ₹21 lakh to carry out the necessary repairs, the Bench said.\nUnderscoring that the senior citizen was in her 80s and given the fact that she had been pursuing the case for over a decade, the Court enhanced the compensation previously awarded to Mathur by a single-judge.\nSenior advocate Akhil Sibal appeared as amicus curiae.\nAdvocates Tushar Sannu and Pooja Gupta represented the MCD, while Advocates Ajjay Aroraa and Anuj Bhargava appeared for the Delhi Jal Board."}

[Jyotsana Rawat and others v. State of Punjab and others]\nJustice Sanjeev Prakash Sharma clarified that a lawyer with such a certificate would not be required to necessarily provide further proof of his legal experience.\n“An advocate who is enrolled with the Bar Council starts actually practice and a certificate of such nature can be given to him by the concerned Bar Association or by the concerned Court where he is practicing or even from any of the judicial or quasi judicial forums where he may be practicing. A certificate issued by the Bar Association of the concerned Court would have the same force as that of a certificate from any other judicial or quasi judicial authority and he, therefore, is not required to necessarily provide further proof of his experience,\" the Court held.\nThe Court made the observation while quashing a Punjab government order that required candidates selected for the post of Assistant District Attorney (ADA) and Deputy District Attorney (DDA) to produce copies of six court orders for each year to prove their experience.\nThe question before the Court was whether the government's demand for the production of court orders to prove legal experience was justified after the candidate was selected for the post.\nThe Court found the State’s decision to scrutinize the experience of candidates ‘too circumscribed.' \nIt explained that the practice of law is not merely restricted to courts as lawyers appear in arbitration matters or before tribunals and other quasi-judicial bodies as well.\n“He or she cannot said to be not having an experience of practice at Bar limiting the practice to mean only appearing in the Court and that too having appearances in at least 6 interim orders is limiting the participation of Advocate’s in the open competition for appointment of the ADA. Similarly is the situation of the DDAs,” the judge observed.\nThe Court concluded that a certificate issued by the concerned court’s Bar Association would be sufficient to show proof of experience. \n“Self attestation or an affidavit of being engaged in advocacy alone can be obtained from a candidate. State may also consider amendment in Rules,” the Court added.\nThe Court, however, also said that the lawyer could be ousted from the Bar if it is shown that he was doing any other business and not engaged in the practice of law.\nThe Court further rejected the Punjab government’s argument that the State has the power to further examine the suitability of the selected candidates.\nIt said the same would amount to allowing the State to act arbitrarily and reject persons who have been found to be meritorious by the examining authority.\nThe Punjab Public Service Commission (PPSC) - which conducted the selection - is a statutory authority and a Superintendent or a Secretary of the State government cannot be allowed to ignore its recommendations by introducing an additional requirement, the Court observed.\n“Only power available with the State Govt. regarding examining the suitability of the said candidate is with reference to his antecedents or his medical fitness for the post,” the bench said.\nIt added that the State can also deny the appointments if there is any forgery, impersonation, nepotism or favouritism.\nThe Court proceeded to direct the State to immediately take steps to fill up the posts of ADAs and DDAs within a period of one month.\nIt also clarified that if the State wants to select (as ADAs) only those advocates who have practiced before a court of law and nowhere else, it should incorporate such conditions in the rules by making appropriate amendments.\nThe State can also put a condition in the advertisement and demand a particular certificate from the candidates at the stage of participation, it added.\n“However, demanding of 6 zimni orders / interim orders with attendance of the lawyer cannot be said to be a sufficient proof of experience,” the Court concluded.\nSenior Advocates Gurminder Singh and BS Sindhu and advocates Jatinder Singh Gill, Shivender Pal Singh and Sheena Khanna, advocates Naresh Kaushal, Anil Kumar Garg and Kanav Bansal, Anshul Sharma and SS Thakur, Pardhuman Garg, Karan Nehra, Abhay Josan and Harvinder Singh, VK Sandhir, Charan Singla, Tarun Bhatta, and DS Nalwa represented different petitioners.\nAdvocates Prateek Mahajan, Daanish Mahajan, and Atul Goyal represented different intervenors.\nAdditional Advocate General Vikas Arora represented the State of Punjab.

The JNU is directed to provide, within a week from the pronouncement of this judgment, all such facilities to the petitioner,” the Court ordered.\nPertinently, the Court said that the appropriate term to describe persons with disability would be 'differently abled' and not 'disabled'. \n\"The Right of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPWD Act) and all laws which strive to provide support to a person suffering from a disability, merely seek to neutralize the disability, so that the person’s ability matches those of the rest of his peers, and they stand on an equal footing. This is the heart of the theory of equal opportunity, which pervades Article 14 and, indeed, the Constitution as a whole. It is because of this, that the more appropriate term to use would be 'differently abled', rather than 'disabled',\" the Court said.\nThe student Sanjeev Kumar Mishra moved the High Court seeking directions to JNU to allot him hostel room. \nIt was JNU’s case that Mishra was pursuing a second Master’s level course and the hostel manual does not entitle him to accommodation.\nThe Court considered the case and ruled in Mishra’s favour.\nIt said that no empirical data has been provided by the JNU to indicate that it would be unreasonable to provide hostel accommodation to the petitioner and without any such data, JNU’s stand cannot sustain.\nIn a detailed order, Justice Hari Shankar further said that persons with disabilities are no different from others and, therefore, the more appropriate term to use for such persons is ‘differently abled’.\n\"Given the means to tide over the difference, a differently abled person no longer remains differently abled, and becomes a part of the homogeneous human whole. It is then that, the difference in ability being neutralized, the individual is able to rise to his full stature, and invoke his innate talents and faculties to their fullest extent. In such a situation, the person who was otherwise regarded as “disabled” often equals, if not excels, his more redoubtable peers in the profession that he pursues.

K Vijayan Vs State of Kerala, Suo Motu Vs. State of Kerala).\nThe Court also directed the Excise Commissioner to file a detailed statement regarding the failure to follow Covid Protocol guidelines in these shops.\nA Division Bench of Chief Justice S Manikumar and Justice Shaji P Chaly, while issuing the directions, cautioned the State saying,\n\"As on today, State of Kerala stands No.1 in Covid 19 cases. Government, on the one hand, is trying to reduce the number of Covid cases, by taking appropriate measures, vaccination, etc. Simultaneously, crowding at public places should not be allowed, more particularly, in liquor shops. Health is more important than revenue.\"\nThe Bench issued these directions on a petition filed by advocate K Vijayan and a suo motu petition initiated by the Court after a High Court Judge addressed a letter to the Chief Justice regarding the issue of overcrowding outside Kerala State Beverages Corporation (KSBC) outlets in violation of COVID-19 protocol.\nAdvocate C Rajendran, appearing for the petitioner, submitted that because of the government's policy directing bars and hotels to sell liquor at the same retail price as offered by Bevco outlets, most bars and hotels have stopped selling liquor as it would affect their profit margin. \nThe government had issued orders prohibiting sale of alcohol during the second wave of the pandemic and re-opened the Bevco outlets only by mid-June. \nConsequently, people have been flocking to Bevco outlets en-masse and are seen crowding at the stores without complying with the physical distancing COVID protocol. \nIn the letter written by a judge of the Court, several photographs were attached showing large gatherings and people standing in long queues outside liquor stores.\nUpon perusing these photographs, the Court observed that social distancing is evidently not maintained or enforced. Moreover, these shops are located on the side of public roads and near residential buildings, putting other people at risk as well. \nState Attorney N Manoj Kumar submitted that appropriate directions have already been issued by the government, regarding the opening of these shops and maintenance of Covid protocol, including social distancing.\nHe also pointed out that the images of crowding outside liquor stores represent the situation only outside a few stores but assured the Court that the government would take appropriate action to reduce instances of queuing without any lapse in Covid protocol.\nStanding Counsel, appearing for KSBC, explained that liquor shops were closed for few days and were opened on June 17 which resulted in the present surge. \nHe also informed the Court that KSBC itself issued Circular on June 16 to all the Regional Managers, DAT's/Warehouse Managers/shop in charge with directions on steps to be taken to strictly observe Covid protocol.\nHowever, the Court observed that despite the fact that the Central and State governments have issued periodical orders regarding Covid protocol guidelines, they do not seem to be observed in letter and spirit at some places, particularly liquor shops. \nFurther, it noted that, it is clearly mentioned in the orders issued by the State specifically regarding opening of Bevco outlets, that any lapse in following the restrictions would be viewed seriously. \nHowever, the Court found that no action is taken against the defaulters so far.\nTherefore, the Court directed the State and the Excise Commissioner to file reports regarding the steps taken to rectify the situation.\nThe case will be heard again on July 13."}

{"ID": "id_1703", "Summary": "The Supreme Court on Monday ruled that the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 does not preclude the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) or the Consumer Forum from entertaining any complaint under Consumer Protection (CP) Act. (M/S Imperial Structures Ltd vs Anil Patni and another)\nA two-judge bench of the court consisting of Justices UU Lalit and Vineet Saran held that real estate allottees can approach NCDRC apart from authorities under the RERA and there is no provision under RERA which bars initiation of a consumer complaint under CP Act. \nThe judgment was rendered in an appeal arising out of the September 2018 decision of the NCDRC which had directed the developer, Imperia Structures to refund the purchase amount along with interest to the buyers for violating the terms of the builder-buyer agreement.\nA housing project was being developed by the developer in Gurugram sometime in 2011 and all the complainants had booked their respective apartments by paying the booking amount and executing builder-buyer agreements.\nHowever, the project was not completed even after payment of substantial amounts prompting a group of buyers to approach the NCDRC in 2017. Later in November 2017, the builder got the project approved by RERA.\nThe builder on this basis challenged the jurisdiction of NCDRC, inter alia, on the ground that the apartments having been booked for commercial purposes, the buyers would not come within the definition of “the consumer” under Section 2(d) of the Consumer Protection Act.\nThe NCDRC, however, held the developer guilty and directed refund of the amounts deposited by each of the complainants along with simple interest at 9 percent per annum from the respective dates of deposit along with Rs. 50,000/- towards costs.\nThe Supreme Court, in its judgment, noted that Section 79 of the RERA Act bars the jurisdiction of a civil court to entertain any suit or proceeding concerning a matter that RERA can decide.\nHowever, the top court stated that it needs to see: a) whether the bar specified under Section 79 of the RERA Act would apply to proceedings initiated under the provisions of the CP Act and; b) whether there is anything inconsistent in the provisions of the CP Act with that of the RERA Act.\nTo decide the above issues the court placed reliance on its judgment in the 2009 case of Malay Kumar Ganguli v. Dr. Sukumar Mukherjee in which it had ruled that NCDRC cannot be considered a civil court under the Code of Civil Procedure though it has all the trappings of a civil court.\n“On the strength of the law so declared, Section 79 of the RERA Act does not in any way bar the Commission or Forum under the provisions of the CP Act to entertain any complaint,”\nthe judgment stated. \nSubstantiating its reasoning, the top court stated that the proviso to Section 71(1) of the RERA Act entitles a complainant who had initiated proceedings under the CP Act before the RERA Act came into force, to withdraw the proceedings under the CP Act with the permission of the Forum or NCDRC and file an appropriate application before the adjudicating officer under the RERA Act.\nThe proviso, the court clarified, gives a right or an option to the concerned complainant but does not statutorily force him to withdraw such complaint nor do the provisions of the RERA Act create any mechanism for transfer of such pending proceedings to authorities under the RERA Act.\nLikewise, where such proceedings under the CP Act are initiated after the provisions of the RERA Act came into force, there is nothing in the RERA Act which bars such initiation, the judgment said. \n\"Thus, the parliamentary intent is clear that a choice or discretion is given to the allottee whether he wishes to initiate appropriate proceedings under the CP Act or file an application under the RERA Act,\"\nthe court ruled. \nThe Supreme Court also stated that the RERA act provides a remedy to an allottee who wishes to withdraw from the project or claim return on his investment and held that the remedy so provided under the RERA Act to an allottee is not the only and exclusive modality to raise a grievance.\n(Read judgment)"}
{"ID": "id_1704", "Summary": "The Delhi High Court Monday ruled that Calling a woman 'gandi aurat' or being rude to her will not amount to the offence of insulting modesty under Section 509 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). \nJustice Swarana Kanta Sharma said that word 'Gandi Aurat' read in isolation without context, without any preceding or succeeding words indicating any intent to outrage modesty of a woman will not bring these words within the ambit of Section 509, IPC.\n“In this context, the words used, 'Gandi Aurat,' while certainly impolite and offensive, do not rise to the level of criminal intent driven words that would typically provoke shock in a woman so as to be covered in the definition of criminal offence under Section 509 of IPC,” the Court said.\nPertinently, the High Court said that courts should be gender neutral even when it is dealing with gender specific offences and merely because a law is designed to address specific gender related concerns, it should not be misconstrued as being inherently anti-men.\nIrrespective of the gender-specific nature of a law, the judicial duty fundamentally requires unwavering neutrality and impartiality, the single-judge stated.\nThe judge's role is to objectively interpret and apply the law, free from any form of gender bias or predisposition, the Court underlined.\nPertinently, the Court said that merely because a law is designed to address specific gender related concerns, it should not be misconstrued as being inherently anti-men.\nIt noted that gender-specific legislation exists to address the unique concerns and challenges faced by particular genders within society. However, this does not imply that the judge is to be influenced or swayed by gender-related factors when administering justice unless specific presumptions are legislated in favour of a particular gender in law.\n“In India, the criminal justice system is adversarial in nature. However, it cannot be seen as adversarial between men and women per se. Instead, it should solely revolve around two individuals: one being the complainant and the other being the accused irrespective of the gender, however, at the same time, while adjudicating the cases firmly remembering and appreciating the social context and situation of a particular gender who may be in a lesser advantageous situation than the other,” Justice Sharma observed.\nIn a detailed judgement pronounced on Monday, the Court also dealt with the issue of ‘outraging modesty of a woman’ and concluded that what constitutes an outrage to modesty can be context-specific, as it depends on societal norms, cultural values, and individual perspectives.\nThe Court stressed that a delicate balance must be struck while construing the intention of the accused in cases of outraging the modesty of a woman and it is not appropriate to automatically presume the existence of this intention without thoroughly considering multifaceted elements.\n“Precise and context-specific assessments are required to ensure that justice is both fair and accurate. This balanced approach acknowledges the need to protect the rights and dignity of women while also recognizing the complexities and nuances of human behaviour, as well as the importance of considering the specific circumstances and background of each case,\" the Court said.\nJustice Sharma made the observations while dealing with a plea filed by a man challenging a trial court order from July 5, 2018 framing charges against him under Section 509 (words, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).\nThe complainant alleged that the accused was her senior at work and that he used bad language against her when she refused to give him ₹1,000 and called her ‘Gandi Aurat’ (dirty woman).\nThe Court considered the case as well as Section 509 of the IPC and concluded that merely calling a woman ‘Gandi Aurat’ (dirty woman) without there being any contextual words indicating an intent to outrage her modesty will not amount to an offence under Section 509.\nJustice Sharma was also of the view that insulting a woman or being rude to her and not behaving with in a chivalrous manner will not be covered under the definition of outraging the modesty of a woman.\nThe Court, therefore, set aside the trial court order.\nAdvocate KC Mittal, Yugansh Mittal and Vaibhav Yadav appeared for the petitioner.\nAdditional Public Prosecutor(APP) Manoj Pant represented the Delhi Police.\nAdvocates Ajit Kumar, Nutan Kumari, Nikita Sharma and Alok Kumar appeared for the complainant."}

If a patient, who wants treatment, is aggrieved in the matter of touch on the body of the petitioner as part of the examination, it is difficult for a doctor to do his medical profession by resorting to clinical examination. The same would include placing of Stethoscope on the left chest portion of the patient to observe and evaluate the heartbeat,” the Court said.\nHowever, the judge also said that genuine cases of misbehavior by doctor overstepping their limits cannot be ignored.\n “At the same time, this Court is conscious of the fact that all allegations on the ground of misbehavior by overstepping the limit of the doctor while examining patients are false. Genuine cases of such nature could not be ruled out in toto, “ the order stated.\nThe Court further said that the truth of those allegations should be evaluated based on evidence and circumstances to separate the grain from the chaff.\nThe Court was considering an anticipatory bail application filed by an accused charged with offences punishable under Sections 341 (wrongful restraint), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), and 294(b) (obscene acts and songs) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) as well as various provisions of the Kerala Healthcare Service Persons and Healthcare Service Institutions (Prevention of Violence and Damage to Property) Act, 2012.\nAs per the prosecution case, on January 8 around 6 PM, when the defacto complainant, who is a doctor by profession, was on-call duty, he had examined the wife of the accused, aged 27 years, at the casualty section of the hospital. \nWhile so, the accused caught hold of the doctor’s collar and slapped him on the allegation that he touched the body of the accused man's wife.\nThe counsel for the accused contended that the doctor had misbehaved with the wife of the accused due to which a complaint was lodged by the wife against the doctor under Section 354 of the IPC (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty). An investigation is ongoing in the said case, the Court was told.\nHe further contended that the accused was innocent and that this case was registered as a counterblast to avoid legal consequences that would arise out of the case lodged by the wife of the accused.\nThe prosecution, on the other hand, strongly opposed the grant of anticipatory bail and contended that the accused has criminal antecedents and that various crimes have been registered against him.\nThe public prosecutor highlighted that attacks against doctors are on the rise alarm and, therefore, doctors are forced to function under threat and fear of physical attack and face apprehensions of implication in crimes.\nThreats against doctors would be detrimental to the interest of people at large, the public prosecutor said.\nAfter going through the case records, the Courts noted that the doctor examined the accused man’s wife in the presence of two sisters in an open space at the casualty. The misbehavior case was registered against the doctor only after the registration of the crime against the accused, it was further observed.\nTherefore, the Court refused to grant anticipatory bail to the accused, stating it could create a dangerous situation, whereby, doctors, who are duty bound to treat patients as part of their oath, will not get protection and the proper maintenance of the health of the public at large would be in peril.\nThe accused was represented by advocates JR Prem Navas, Sumeen S and Muhammad Swadiq.\nThe respondent was represented by advocate PG Manu."}

The Director, CBI, is directed to immediately take over the investigation and hand it over to a competent investigating officer,\" the order stated.\nThe Bench was hearing a petition filed by the son of the victim highlighting the lethargic approach of the Gwalior Police in investigating the sudden death of his father, who was mercilessly beaten while in custody.\nAs per the petition, on August 10, 2019, the petitioner's father and a neighbour had an altercation over land. The duo went to the police to file complaints against each other. However, the petitioner alleged that the police lodged a case against his father and when he tried to persuade the cops to register his complaint too, he was mercilessly beaten. He claimed that his father succumbed to the severe injuries inflicted by the police.\nThe accused police personnel, on the other hand, maintained that the deceased was only restrained in the police station while the complainant was referred for a medical test. By then, the victim committed suicide by entering the lockup and hanging himself. \nOn a complaint by the petitioner, a First Information Report (FIR) was lodged against Vijay Singh Rajput, the then Station House Officer, Head Constable and his deputies - Arun Mishra, Dharmendra, Neeraj Prajapati and Vijay Kushwaha. Even Homeguard Sainik Ehsaan Khan was booked in the case.\nIn his 64-page judgment, Justice Ahluwalia noted that despite an FIR being lodged, the probe initially didn't proceed properly and it is only after the petitioner approached the Superintendent of Police, Gwalior that the investigation was transferred from Belgada police station to the neighbouring Bhitarwar police station.\nThe Bench noted that even the investigating officers of Bhitarwar did not carry out a proper probe, and in fact, tried to protect the accused officers. Three years since the incident, none of the accused have been arrested and no chargesheet has been filed yet. The accused cops were suspended for a few months and were later reinstated.\nEvidence showed that the accused cops had kept the deceased in illegal detention. The Court said that even if the victim committed suicide, there was no question of Safi (rope) being kept inside the lockup. It further noted that CCTV footage was tampered by the accused cops, who claimed that there was a power cut in the police station at the time.\nTaking note of all these circumstances, the Bench said that the Gwalior Police camouflaged the situation to protect the culprits.\n\"It is clear that although the Gwalior Police, had camouflaged the situation and in order to give false impression in the mind of the general public, projected that the matter is being investigated by a senior police officer of a different District, but unfortunately, the Superintendent of Police Gwalior did not take any pains to restore the belief and faith of the general public in the police, but on the contrary, deliberately closed their eyes in order to ignore the manner in which investigation was being done.\"\nThe Bench was irked to note that the Superintendent of Police, Gwalior, instead of instituting disciplinary proceedings against the erring cops, 'facilitated' the retirement of prime accused Rajput. This, the Bench opined, was nothing but an 'out and out privilege' to Rajput to retire with all retiral benefits.\nTherefore, the Bench ordered the Director General Police, MP to conduct an inquiry to ascertain if the investigating officers could be booked under the Prevention of Corruption Act or the Indian Penal Code for 'protecting the accused cops.' If the DGP finds so, then he should request the CBI to make the three investigating officers as accused in the case, the Court said.\nA further direction was issued to initiate departmental enquiry against the Superintendent and also the other investigating officers of the case.\nFurther, the DGP was ordered to once again suspend all the accused cops till the end of the trial.\n\"These directions are necessary so that the faith of the general public in criminal justice system is maintained,\" Justice Ahluwalia clarified.\nAdvocate Nirmal Sharma appeared for the petitioner.

She said that she was given some medicines by her mother-in-law with an assurance that a son would be born but it was intended to abort her pregnancy.\nAfter considering the case, the Court noted that even though the wife had claimed that she was subjected to harassment for dowry and cruelty, she has not been able to substantiate her assertions and this amounts to an act of cruelty.\nThe Court said that it was only in the appeal that the woman first claimed that her husband got married and sired two sons. However, the Bench added that neither any specific details nor any proof of the alleged second marriage has been tendered on record or given in the complaints to the police.\nTherefore, the Court rejected the appeal and upheld the trial court order granting divorce.\nAdvocates RK Bali, Pragya Verma and Meghna Bali appeared for the wife.\nThe husband was represented by advocates Sahil Malik, Abhishek Kumar and Jitender."}
{"ID": "id_171", "Summary": "The Delhi High Court refused to entertain a plea seeking action against Reliance’s mega zoo and a trust owned by the conglomerate for organising Anant Ambani’s wedding with Radhika Merchant at Reliance Greens in Jamnagar, Gujarat. \nAn advocate named Rahul Narula had approached the High Court seeking directions to the Animal Welfare Board of India to file a complaint against Radhe Krishna Temple Elephant Welfare Trust and Greens Zoological, Rescue and Rehabilitation Centre.\nHe said that various wedding-related events that are scheduled for March will harm the animals in the area.\nA Bench of Justices Suresh Kumar Kait and Girish Kathpalia observed that the petition cannot be entertained since it is merely based on apprehensions.\nThe Court, however, said that the High Powered Committee (HPC) constituted to examine complaints about animal organisations can be present at the location to oversee the event and take all precautions to ensure no inhumane behaviour is caused to the animals. \nThe HPC was constituted on the orders of the Tripura High Court in 2022. \n“Since a High Powered Committee has already been constituted after the directions passed by Hon’ble Tripura High Court in the case of Sudipa Nath (supra), therefore, the said Committee is at liberty to be present and oversee the aforesaid event and to take all cautions permissible under law, if any, to ensure that no inhumane behaviour is caused to the animals… It is made clear that either HPC may depute any of its member to oversee the event scheduled from 01.03.2024 to 03.02.2024 or HPC may go itself to oversee the aforesaid event,” the Court ordered.\nIn his plea, Narula had said that he came across a newspaper report in January regarding the wedding of Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant. As per the report and the wedding card, the dates of the pre-wedding and wedding festivities are in March and the venue is Reliance Greens in Jamnagar, Gujarat.\nNarula said that Reliance has direct control over the zoo and the trust as they are situated on the property owned by Reliance. Further, the invite is the evidence that they are going to hold functions, parties, events, or performances at the location.\nHe also challenged Section 23 of The Prevention Of Cruelty To Animals Act, 1960, on the ground that his right to file a criminal complaint on the issue was being curtailed by the said provision. \nMeanwhile, counsel appearing for Radhe Krishna Temple Elephant Welfare Trust and Greens Zoological, Rescue and Rehabilitation Centre stated that the petition was not maintainable, that it was frivolous and filed with ulterior motives.\nHe argued that the petition was based on an unfounded apprehension that use of animals will be allowed in a private event.\nThe Court was also told that Reliance Complex, Jamnagar is spread over 7,500 acres including a 3,059 acre green belt and is a private property not open for public events.\nIt was stated that a one-time private, personal and non-commercial event is being held for the wedding in various locations in the complex and there is no provision that prohibits the zoo or the trust from inviting guests to view their facilities, especially for non-commercial purposes.\nThe Court considered the case and found no grounds to pass any directions.\nAdvocate Pritam Biswas appeared for the petitioner.\nAdvocates Shardul Singh, Devika Mohan, Ahish Shahpurkar and Anjali Tiwari represented Radhe Krishna Temple Elephant Welfare Trust and Greens Zoological, Rescue and Rehabilitation Centre."}

{"ID": "id_1711", "Summary": "The Union Law Ministry has accepted the suggestion made by the department-related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Personnel, Public Grievances, Law and Justice last year to establish regional benches of the Supreme Court across India.\nThe Committee on February 6 submitted a report on the action taken on its 133rd report titled Judicial Processes and their Reforms.\nThe 133rd Report was presented to the Rajya Sabha on August 7, 2023 and laid on the table of the Lok Sabha on the same day. Eight months later, the Committee has come out with a report on the action taken by the Ministry of Law & Justice.\nThe Committee had made 22 recommendations in the report. In the action taken report, the replies of the government have been categorized and scrutinized under four chapters.\nAmong the recommendations made by the Committee were the setting up of regional benches of the Supreme Court, increasing the retirement age of Supreme Court and High Court judges, batting for more social diversity in judicial appointments and reassessment of post-retirement jobs for judges.\n1. Recommendations accepted by the department\ni) Feasibility of regional benches of Supreme Court\nThe Committee in its 133rd report had recommended the establishment of regional benches of the Supreme Court for better access to justice.\nIn the action taken report, the Committee has said,\n\"The Committee feels that the demand for having regional benches of the Supreme Court of India is about 'access to justice,' which is a fundamental right under the Constitution...The regional benches may also be seen as a solution to the overflowing caseload of the judiciary and to reduce the litigation cost to the common man.\"\nIt also noted that in a petition on establishment of a National Court of Appeal, the Supreme Court had referred the issue to a Constitution Bench. It also stated,\n\"The Supreme Court has been consistently rejecting the proposal for setting up of the Benches of Supreme Court at a place outside Delhi.\"\nii) Preparation and publication of annual reports by High Courts and the Supreme Court\nThe 133rd report had also recommended preparation of annual reports by High Courts and the Supreme Court on what the institutions had done over the past year.\nThe action taken report notes that the Chief Justice of India (CJI) and Chief Justices of all High Courts had already been requested in June 2023 to consider publication of annual reports by all the High Courts and dissemination of the same through their websites, on the lines of the Orissa High Court's initiative.\n2. Recommendations that the Committee wishes not to pursue in light of the department's replies\ni) Possibility of increasing retirement age of High Court and Supreme Court judges\nThe Committee had recommended that the age of retirement of judges needs to be increased in sync with the advancement in medical sciences leading to improved health of the population.\nThe government has said that if the retirement age is increased, there will be no limit to it. Further, there may efforts to increase the age in the future. \nThe Committee had also recommended that while increasing the retirement age, the performance of judges could be reassessed based on their health conditions, quality of judgments, number of judgments delivered etc.\nAccording to the government, linking performance evaluation to the issue of increase in retirement age may not be practical and may not actually bring out the desired results. \n\"This will result in empowering the Supreme Court Collegium (SCC) for the evaluation of the Judges at the time of giving extensions on individual basis and will further erode the powers of Parliament and empower judiciary through the SCC to take decision on the enhancement of age,\" it has said.\nFurther, as per the government, this step may also result in undue favouritism and make the judges susceptible to pressures, thus impinging on their performance as impartial judges. \nii) Vacancies in the Supreme Court and High Courts\nThe 133rd report had also pointed out how vacancies, and not necessarily vacations, were the cause of high pendency in the higher judiciary.\nThe government has explained that while every effort is made to fill up the existing vacancies expeditiously, vacancies in High Courts do keep on arising on account of retirement, resignation or elevation of judges and also due to increase in the strength of judges.\n3. Recommendations in respect of which the Committee has not accepted the replies of the department\ni) Social diversity in appointments of judges\nThe 133rd report said that the higher judiciary suffers from a 'diversity deficit' and that representation of Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs), Other Backward Classes (OBCs), women and minorities is far below the desired levels and does not reflect the social diversity of the country.\nThe department highlighted that in the present system of appointments, the judiciary initiates the proposals to appoint High Court and Supreme Court judges, and the onus of addressing the issue rests with the Judiciary. \nThe government has stated that it is committed to social diversity in the appointment of judges in the higher judiciary and has been requesting Chief Justices of High Courts that while sending proposals for appointment of judges, due consideration be given to suitable candidates belonging to SCs, STs, OBCs, minorities and women to ensure social diversity.\nThe Committee, however, has observed that the views on the draft Memoranda of Procedure (MoP) of the Supreme Court for appointments to the higher judiciary are still awaited. \n\"Whenever it is finalized, the Government may factor in the aspect of social diversity into it. The Committee desires that the Ministry may pursue the Supreme Court to send its views on the MoP at the earliest,\" it has said.\nii) Post-retirement assignments to judges\nThe Committee had taken the view that with the increase in the age of retirement of judges, the practice of post-retirement assignments to judges of Supreme Court and High Courts in bodies financed by the public exchequer should be reassessed to ensure their impartiality.\nThe department stated that appointments of retired Supreme Court judges to various constitutional posts, commissions, tribunals etc. are made by different Ministries or Departments as per relevant rules laid down, and that some of these bodies require the expertise and experience possessed by judges of the Supreme Court or High Courts.\nThe Committee, however, has suggested that the entire gamut of issues related to such appointments of retired judges may be comprehensively studied again and relooked upon by the Ministry.\niii) Vacations in High Courts and the Supreme Court\nThe Committee had taken the view that the suggestion of former CJI RM Lodha that instead of all judges going on vacation at the same time, individual judges should take leave at different times through the year so that courts are constantly open, should be considered.\nSince vacations for the Supreme Court and various High Courts are prescribed as per the rules framed by the respective courts, the recommendations of the Committee have been sent by the Department of Justice to the Supreme Court and the Registrars General of the High Courts after due approval of the Minister of State (I/C) for Law & Justice, and their response is awaited.\nThe Committee has urged the department to seek responses from the Supreme Court and High Courts on the recommendation.\n\"Once this issue is finalized, the Courts will have more days at its disposal, which will enable it to reduce the pendency and mitigate the inconvenience presently being faced by the litigants, to a large extent,\" the Committee has said.\n4. Recommendations in which final replies of the government have not been received\ni) Mandatory declaration of assets by Supreme Court and High Court judges\nThe 133rd report had also recommended that judges in the higher judiciary annually declare their assets and liabilities.\nThe department has said that it is in consultation with the Registry of the Supreme Court and has solicited their views in the matter. The Committee has urged the department to fast track the process and apprise the committee of the same."}

The petitioner contended that the film has the potential to disrupt harmony among citizens and jeopardize the integrity of the nation.\nA bench of Justice Ashwani Kumar Mishra and Justice Ashutosh Srivastava opined that allegations raised by the petitioner could not be termed as baseless or ill-founded. \nThe Court also noted that no irreparable injury would be caused to Al Jazeera if the broadcast of the film is allowed after a scrutiny of the issues raised by the petitioner.\n\"Considering the evil consequences that are likely to occur on the telecast/broadcast of film in question its telecast/broadcast we are of the view that the broadcast/telecast of the film in question be deferred pending consideration of the cause in the present petition. No irreparable injury would otherwise be caused to the fifth respondent if the telecast/broadcast of the film is allowed after required scrutiny of the issues raised in the present petition,\" the Court said.\nHence, the Court has imposed a temporary bar on the film's broadcast until the petition is finally decided. \n\"In view of the deliberations and discussions held above, we restrain the fifth respondent from telecasting/broadcasting/ releasing the Film \"India....Who lit the Fuse?\" till the issues raised in the present petition are adjudicated after notice to the fifth respondent (Al Jazeera),\" the Court ordered.\nThe Court further directed the Central government to undertake necessary actions required by law to ensure that the film is not permitted to be telecast or broadcast unless its contents are reviewed by legal authorities and the requisite certification or authorization is obtained from the competent authority.\n\"The authorities of Union and State Government are directed to act in aid of above directions and thereby secure social harmony and protect the security and interest of the Indian State,\" the Court said.\nThe Court noted that the petitioner had made serious allegations that the film in question was based on distorted facts with the intention of disrupting the social and communal harmony in the world's largest democracy. \nThe petitioner claimed that he had reliably learnt from print and social media reports that the film portrays the Muslim minority in India as living in fear and that it presented a disruptive narrative to create a sense of public hatred, which was far from reality. \nThe petitioner added that the film negatively portrayed the political functionaries of the Indian State and projected them as acting against the interest of minorities. He raised concern that the film deliberately sought to create a rift between India’s largest religious communities.\nThe Court was further informed that Al Jazeera Media Network Private Ltd, a news channel based in Doha, Qatar, was about to release the film without obtaining the required exhibition certificate from the competent statutory authority in India.\nThe petitioner expressed concern that telecast of the film, without adhering to such Constitutional and statutory safeguards, could potentially harm public order, and the sovereignty and integrity of India. \n\"Undisputedly, no certificate has been issued by the third respondent (Central Board of Film Certification) for unrestricted public exhibition under the Act of 1952,\" the Court found. \nThe Court added that although the Constitution of India guarantees the fundamental right of freedom of speech and expression, the same is subject to the reasonable restrictions specified in Article 19(2) of the Constitution of India.\nThe Court referred to the Cinematograph Act, 1952, the Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act, 1995, the Information Technology Act, 2000, and associated rules, regulations, and statutory guidelines to check whether the broadcast of the film would violate the statutory framework established by these enactments.\nUltimately, taking into account the gravity of the allegations made in the plea, the Court stayed the release of the film until the case is finally decided.\nThe matter will be heard next on July 6.\nAdvocate Krishna Mohan Tripathi represented the petitioner."}
{"ID": "id_1717", "Summary": "A murder convict awarded life imprisonment twenty five years ago was recently acquitted by the Patna High Court for want of evidence in support of the victim's dying declaration, which was the sole basis of conviction [Balmiki Prasad Chourasia v. State of Bihar].\nA Bench of Justices AM Badar and Sunil Kumar Panwar declined to hold the dying declaration of the deceased woman as the “sole basis for conviction” and acquitted the man accused of her murder.\nAccording to the Bench, the trial court, which awarded the life term punishment to the appellant, had erred in appreciating the evidence in support of the woman’s dying declaration.\n“We have noted that the learned trial court has completely misread the material evidence and has failed to consider the legal position in respect of appreciation of evidence concerning the dying declaration,” the Bench noted.\nMore than twenty five years ago, a trial court in Munger had convicted the appellant for killing his wife in August 1993. The man is alleged to have inflicted fatal injuries to the woman, who was admitted to a hospital but gave a statement before she died. Section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code was added to the case following which the man was charged and put on trial. He was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment on July 3, 1995.\nBefore the High Court, counsel for the appellant argued that the dying declaration of the victim was “untrustworthy and unreliable” as it was not recorded after the victim's medical examination. He argued that the woman had succumbed to her injuries soon after the alleged incident and thus was not in a position to record her statement.\nThe prosecution contended that the woman’s statement showed the appellant’s complicity in the crime.\nThe Bench underlined that in order to pass the test of reliability, a dying declaration was required to be \"subjected to a close scrutiny and it had to be kept in mind that such a statement was made in the absence of the accused,\" who does not have an opportunity of testing the veracity of such a statement by way of a cross-examination.\n“If the dying declaration fails to pass the test of reliability and truthfulness, then the same is required to be ignored from consideration. There is no rule of law that the dying declaration must be recorded by a particular authority,” it added.\nAfter examining the declaration, the Court observed that it was written “mechanically in the format in which police usually records” the statement of a victim or of witnesses. The declaration was therefore stated to be “doubtful and suspicious”, one that was unexpected from a person suffering a serious injury on vital parts of her body after heavy blood loss.\n\"Deceased Mira Kumari was a rustic villager. It does not stand to reason that she was able to narrate the minute details of the incident and referring the intention of the assailant to commit her murder,” the Court noted.\nAccording to the Bench, the statement looked “artificial in nature” besides having no resemblance of a statement of a dying person. The Court also commented on the manner in which the victim’s statement was recorded by a police officer before her death, observing:\n“It seems that this police officer had shown his over enthusiasm in getting the statement of the deceased Mira Kumari alias Shakuntala Devi prepared without getting her examined to ascertain her fitness from the attending medical officer from the Government Hospital, where she was taking medical treatment.”\nWhile setting aside the judgment of the trial court, the Court acquitted the appellant of the offence.\nThe Court appreciated the efforts of the appellant’s legal aid counsel, Amish Kumar, for his assistance. Additional Public Prosecutor Ajay Mishra represented the State."}
{"ID": "id_1719", "Summary": "The Delhi High Court recently observed that if a spouse condones an extramarital illicit or intimate affair, it cannot later be called an act of cruelty in divorce proceedings. \nIn the present case, the Court found that the wife had expressed her willingness to continue living with the husband, despite such an episode. \nHence, the Court held that such an affair cannot be viewed as cruelty to the wife during divorce proceedings. \n“It has been rightly concluded ... that it was an act which was condoned by the appellant who despite this episode, had expressed her willingness to continue to reside with the respondent. Once an act which lasted for a short while had been condoned, it cannot be taken as an act of cruelty while deciding the petition for divorce,” the Court observed.\nA division bench of Justices Suresh Kumar Kait and Neena Bansal Krishna added that things would have been different had this illicit relationship been a turning point in the relationship between the husband and wife.\nHowever, in this case, while the brief extramarital intimate relationship from over ten years ago did create some turbulence, the Court found that the spouses were able to sail over it.\nThe Court also noted that making friends at the workplace or talking to them cannot be held to be a cruel act or an act of ignoring the wife, particularly when the spouses were living apart due to the nature of their work.\n“A person who is essentially living alone, may find solace by having friends and merely because he used to talk to his friends, it can neither be held to be an act of ignoring the appellant (wife) nor a cruel act. It has to be appreciated that both the parties having been essentially living separately because of their work exigencies, were bound to make friends at their place of work and otherwise; and such friendships without anything more, cannot be termed as cruelty,\" the Court observed.\nThe Court further underscored that in disputes between parents, children cannot be alienated or used as a weapon.\nThe Court made these observations while dealing with an appeal filed by a woman challenging a family court order granting divorce to her husband on the grounds of desertion and cruelty.\nThe husband told the Court that he was an Indian Army officer and was posted in different areas for official duty. He said that the relations between him and his wife were estranged on account of the indifferent attitude of the wife. The husband claimed that the wife hardly talked to him, which caused deep frustration and depression in his mind.\nThe husband further contended that in order to shift the blame on him, the wife wrote various complaints to the Commanding Officer, Family Welfare Organization and the Army Headquarters, making “baseless, frivolous and false allegations” and blaming him for deserting her and their daughter.\nMeanwhile, the wife argued that the man had continued with an extra marital relationship and was trying to take advantage of his own wrong by getting rid of the appellant (wife) through divorce.\nShe denied the allegations made by her husband. She further claimed that the husband would only visit her briefly during his annual holidays and leaves and that during this period, he inflicted physical and mental cruelty upon her.\nThe Court considered the case and held that the wife had committed cruelty against the husband by alienating their only daughter and writing various complaints to the husband’s superiors.\n“Once vindictiveness has crept in and the appellant had marched on to the war path and filed not only complaints in the Department but also initiated various civil/legal cases since 2011, i.e., for about 12 years and has even alienated the daughter from the respondent, it leads to irresistible conclusion that various acts of cruelty have been committed towards the respondent (husband),\" the Court said. \nThe Court, however, said that no grounds of desertion were made out in the case.\n“The divorce was also granted on the ground of desertion, but from the above discussion, it is evident that the things had gone to an extent where neither the appellant nor the respondent were in a position to restore their marital ties. In these circumstances, it cannot be held that it was a case of desertion by the wife for a period of more than two years from the date of separation ie July, 2011 onwards,\" the Court observed. \nThe Court, therefore, proceeded to uphold the divorce decree on the ground of cruelty alone.\nAdvocate Anu Narula appeared for the appellant wife.\nThe husband was represented by advocate Arvind Chaudhary."}

{"ID": "id_1723", "Summary": "The Bombay High Court Monday rejected the bail plea filed by former cop Pradeep Sharma, accused in the Antilia bomb-scare case and the murder of businessman Mansukhlal Hiren.\nA division bench of Justices Revati Mohite Dere and RN Laddha, while rejecting the bail plea, expressed its dissatisfaction over the probe conducted by the National Investigation Agency (NIA).\nThe Court after going through the evidence on record, prima facie failed to find material from the NIA chargesheet to indicate that Sharma was involved in the parking and planting of the gelatin sticks in the Scorpio car outside Antilia. \n“If this was the NIA’s case, why then had they remained silent and not disclosed the same in the charge-sheet, is perplexing”, the Court said. \nThe Court also observed that the agency had failed to carry out an in-depth investigation in the bomb scare matter.\n“We, prima facie, find that the NIA has not done investigation with regard to the same i.e. with respect to the co-conspirators involved in planting of gelatin sticks in the Scorpio vehicle,” the Court said in its 53-page order.\nThe Court, however, rejected Sharma's bail plea after it found material on record which pointed to Sharma’s complicity towards the murder of businessman Mansukh Hiren.\n“The possibility of the appellant, a retired Police Officer, having clout, tampering with the witnesses, cannot be ruled out. It is also pertinent to note that the appellant was facing prosecution for the offences punishable under Sections 302 (murder) of IPC in an encounter case. This is not a fit case to enlarge Sharma on bail,” the Court said.\nSharma along with other accused including dismissed Mumbai cop Sachin Waze are accused of conspiring to place an explosive laden SUV near the residence of industrialist Mukesh Ambani.\nThey also stand accused in the murder of businessman Mansukh Hiren in February 2021.\nAfter filing a detailed investigation report, the Court deduced, that NIA was trying to link Sharma with the Scorpio vehicle (laden with gelatin sticks) but he had not been chargesheeted.\n“Prima facie, we feel that this feeble attempt was made to connect the appellant with Sachin Waze only when we questioned the NIA, as to with whom Sachin Waze had conspired with, in planting of gelatin sticks in the Scorpio vehicle,” the Court said.\nThe Court said tha several questions remained unanswered by NIA with respect to the case of the Scorpio vehicle laden with gelatin sticks. \n“We hope and trust, that NIA, in right earnest, will investigate this aspect since further investigation under Section 173(8) is pending,” the Court further said."}

The petitioner, however, violated the order and held an assembly and was, therefore, detained for a few hours.\nGoswami then moved the High Court seeking publication and online access to all rules, regulations, instructions, manuals and records held by the State or under its control or used by its employees for discharging its functions. \nShe argued that the failure to publish such rules amounted to illegality of executive action, violation of democracy, rule of law and natural justice and infringement of her rights of free speech and expression and assembly enshrined in Article 19 of the Constitution and also her right to life under Article 21.\nThe State, however, contended that the petitioner is not entitled to such information as by no stretch would denying permission for a 'political rally' infringe her fundamental right.\nThe Court, however, ruled in favour of the petitioner. \n\"The State cannot refuse to produce such rules or orders inasmuch as, what is evident from the mandate of the Act read in context of the objectives of the Act is to promote free flow of information. What is rightly submitted by petitioner while quoting Lon L Fuller that 'there can be no greater legal monstrosity than a secret statute,\" the bench held.\nRegarding the contention of the State that the information sought by the petitioner does not affect her rights since her protest was a political one, the bench said, \n\"...such information need not be provided (on this ground) is in the opinion of this Court, killing and smothering the very purpose of the Right to Information Act, which, is evident from the preamble thereof which is to promote transparency in democracy.\"\nThe Court further held that the State is under a legal duty to publish information and the petitioner is entitled to know the rules framed under Section 33 of the Gujarat Police Act, so as to know the reasons for denial of permission. \nIn the absence of such knowledge, she will be handicapped in challenging such permission which will be a direct infringement of her fundamental right and a statutory right to know and access the law of the land which she violated, the Court said. \n\"For all the aforesaid reasons therefore, the petition is allowed.

{"ID": "id_1726", "Summary": "The Supreme Court on Tuesday took exception to the trend of courts allowing cases involving allegations of cheating, which is punishable under Section 420 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), to effectively become money recovery proceedings on the whims of the lawyer [Ramesh Kumar vs State of NCT of Delhi].\nA bench of Justices S Ravindra Bhat and Dipankar Datta stressed that High Courts and trial courts should not be 'unduly swayed' by lawyers who call for making the amount in dispute the deposit needed for the grant of anticipatory bail in such cases.\n\"A disquieting trend emerging over the years which has gained pace in recent times necessitates this opinion. It has been found by us in multiple cases in the past several months that upon First Information Reports being lodged inter alia under section 420 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (“the IPC”, hereafter), judicial proceedings initiated by persons, accused of cheating, to obtain orders under Section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (“the Cr. PC”, hereafter) are unwittingly being transformed into processes for recovery of the quantum of money allegedly cheated and the courts driven to impose conditions for deposit/payment as pre-requisite for grant of pre-arrest bail,\" the Court noted.\nThe observations came while setting aside a Delhi High Court order that had set a condition for the accused to pay an amount of ₹ 22 lakh as a condition for anticipatory bail. \nThe amount was to be paid by the owner of a plot of land who was implicated in a cheating case that arose from a land redevelopment agreement. The criminal proceedings arose after some homebuyers alleged that the builder and broker had not completed the construction of flats as promised despite taking big amounts as payment.\nDuring anticipatory bail proceedings before the High Court, the counsel for the accused had voluntarily agreed to pay the deposit amount in order to secure relief. \nHowever, when the matter reached the Supreme Court in appeal, the accused expressed his inability to arrange such funds within the stipulated time.\nThe Supreme Court opined that setting such conditions for bail would defeat its purpose and intent. \n\"Inclusion of a condition for payment of money by the applicant for bail tends to create an impression that bail could be secured by depositing money alleged to have been cheated … No Court should be averse to putting public money back in the system if the situation is conducive therefor. We are minded to think that this approach would be in the larger interest of the community. However, such an approach would not be warranted in cases of private disputes where private parties complain of their money being involved in the offence of cheating,” the top court explained. \nThe Court added that even if the appellant-accused had himself suggested that he would make such payment, such an undertaking should not have weighed in the mind of the High Court to decide on the question of grant of anticipatory bail.\nThe bench also termed the appellant's initial undertaking to pay such money as a 'last ditch effort to avert losing his liberty'.\n\"Under the circumstances, we hold that the High Court fell in grave error in proceeding on the basis of the undertaking of the appellant and imposing payment of Rs.22,00,000 as a condition precedent for grant of bail,\" the Court concluded.\nThe top court further opined that the High Court ought not to have allowed what appeared to be a civil dispute to turn into criminal proceedings.\n\"The High Court ought to have realized that having regard to the nature of dispute between the parties, which is predominantly civil in nature, the process of criminal law cannot be pressed into service for settling a civil dispute,\" the judgment stated.\nThe Supreme Court proceeded to remand that matter back to the High Court for a fresh decision. The appellant was granted interim protection from arrest till then.\nAdvocate Sarvesh Bisaria and ER Sumathy appeared for the appellant.

One of the videos even claimed that she has passed away. The videos further alleged that Bachchans did not take any steps to provide prompt medical attention to the child.\nHowever, the plaint stated that Aaradhya is in good health and has not been hospitalised.\nDuring the hearing, Justice Shankar came down upon the streaming platform for what it considered to be omission in carrying out its responsibility by allowing such false information to be disseminated through its platform.\n\"If you are making money out of what you are doing, you have a social responsibility. You can't allow such things to be posted on your platform. You acknowledge that there are certain things for which you have zero tolerance. Why should this not fall in that category?

Thus, the case of the appellant squarely falls within Clause 3 of Section 6 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961, so as to maintain the custody of dowry articles with the complainant.

State of Haryana and State by Belakavadi Police v. Mallesha to contend that the ornaments and articles were given by the complainant to his deceased daughter at the time of marriage, and therefore, he was entitled to receive the same.\nThe High Court said that the case of the husband squarely falls within clause 3 of Section 6 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961, so as to maintain the custody of dowry articles with the complainant. Section 6(3) states:\n\"Where the woman entitled to any property under sub-section (1) dies before receiving it, the heirs of the woman shall be entitled to claim it from the person holding it for the time being:-\nProvided that where such woman dies within seven years of her marriage, otherwise, than due to natural causes, such property shall-\n(a) if she has no children, transferred to her parents; or \n(b) if she has children, be transferred to such children and pending such transfer be held in trust for such children.\"\nIt held that the trial court rightly placed reliance upon Balbir Singh’s case, wherein it was held that husband was not entitled to retain dowry even if he was acquitted, and dowry articles will remain with father of deceased.\n\"But in the instant case the accused husband has been convicted by the trial Court under Section 302 IPC for committing murder of his wife Shweta Singh.

A direction was then issued for removal of encroachment of religious structures on the public space without any discrimination.\nWhen the matter reached the Supreme Court in appeal, the top court in 2010 directed all the States and Union Territories to formulate a comprehensive policy regarding the removal of the religion structures.\nTaking note of the top court’s directions, the High Court in December 2022, directed the State to file a status report on action taken against the illegal religious structures.\nHowever, the bench headed by Chief Justice Agarwal found the affidavit filed by State to be unclear and also took exception to State’s submission for disposal of the case.\n“The statement in the said affidavit that the petition be disposed of by this Court as the action plan which has been conceived by the State Government will take care of any further encroachment, is wholly uncalled for,” the bench said.\nThe Court remarked that though the policy decision issued by the government in 2022 has been appended with the affidavit, the compliance with the said resolution has not been brought on record.\nTherefore, the Court directed the government pleader to file an affidavit of the Secretary of Home Department in strict compliance with the directions passed earlier in view of the apex court’s order of 2010.\nThe Court will hear the matter next on February 27."}

Therefore, we are inclined to pass an interim order directing the respondents, to provide food, as done before, by including meat and chicken, to the children of the schools in Lakshadweep,\" the order said. \nThe observations came on a petition filed by a resident of Kavaratti Island, Advocate Ajmal Ahmed, against the reforms by the administration.\nThe Court also stayed the decision of the administration to stop the functioning of dairy farms in the Union Territory. \n\"Functioning of the dairy farms should be continued until further orders,\" the Court said. \nThe petition sought to quash the orders passed by the Administration, under new Administrator, Praful Patel, to ban meat from midday meals and shut down dairy farms on the island, among others.\nThe petition alleged that these reforms infringe upon the ethnic culture, heritage, food habits and the rights of the residents under Articles 19 and 300A of the Constitution of India.\nAdvocate Peeyus Kottam, appearing for the petitioner submitted that the decision of the Administration was contrary to the National Programme of Mid Day Meal in Schools (MDMS) Annual Work Plan and Budget 2020-21, wherein there is a provision to provide meat and chicken to the children of the schools of Union Territory of Lakshadweep. He further contended that there is no reason as to why, Union Territory of Lakshadweep has taken a different decision.\nStanding counsel for Lakshadweep Administration, Sri S Manu, submitted that the order changing midday meal menu was issued for the academic year 2020-2021, and that, therefore, it has no relevance for the academic year 2021-22, \nHowever, the Bench opined , \"we are unable to understand how there could be a change in the menu of food items given to the children, prepared taking into account, the vital aspect of health factor, and how such a distinction can be drawn, merely, by saying that it was prepared, for a different academic year\".\nThe Court saw no prima facie reason for the change of food items, with the exclusion of meat and chicken. \nTherefore, it passed an interim order directing the respondents, to provide food, as done before, by including meat and chicken, to the children of the schools in Lakshadweep.\nThe Court directed in its order that \"food, including meat, chicken, fish and egg, and other items, prepared and served to the school going children of Lakshadweep, as done in the past, should be continued until further orders.

The lockdown has been lifted and the country is returning to normalcy. Almost all the Courts and Tribunals are functioning either physically or by virtual mode. We are of the opinion that the order dated 15.03.2020 has served its purpose and in view of the changing scenario relating to the pandemic, the extension of limitation should come to an end.\"\nHowever, the impleadment application seeking to restore the earlier order stated that it cannot be disputed that the public health is of utmost importance and “therefore the issue of limitation which may arise in certain cases is required to be relaxed in the light of the present situation.”"}

Union of India & Ors and connected petitions]\nA Bench of Justices GS Patel and Neela Gokhale pronounced the verdict today in the four petitions filed by stand-up comic Kunal Kamra, the Editors Guild of India, the Association of Indian Magazines and the News Broadcast and Digital Association.\nWhile Justice Patel ruled in favour of the petitioners and struck down the provision, Justice Gokhale dismissed the petitions. \n\"We have, with due respect to each other’s views, agreed to disagree. To my mind, it is possibly the most complete answer to the very issue at hand, reinforcing thoroughly my view: that in our country, and under our Constitution, an alternative view should not ever be allowed to go unsaid, unheard or unread,\" Justice Patel said in his 148 page opinion. \nJustice Patel struck down the rule after holding that the Rule 3 attempted to curtail Article 19(1)(a) and was ultra vires the Information Technology Act.\nHe opined that the Rule censors user content and effectively makes the Central government through the FCU, the sole arbiter of the what is fake, false or misleading. \nIt effectively allows the government through its FCU the arbiter of the right to place an opposing point of view, the judge added. \nThe judge also said that the government was not a class of its own to justify preferential treatment. \n\"It is posited on the assumption that government-related information is somehow special and deserving of extra protection,\" the judge reasoned.\nJustice Patel also noted that the phrases 'fake, false, misleading' and 'business of the government' were not defined which was reason enough to invalidate the piece of legislation. \n\"There is no safeguard against bias. There are no guidelines, no procedure for hearing, no opportunity to counter the case that some information is fake, false or misleading. This is not, on the face of it, a matter of subjective satisfaction on objective material. The Rule clearly makes the Central Government a judge in its own cause, the cause being the business of the Central Government,\" the single-judge said while striking down the rules. \nJustice Gokhale on the other hand opined that the Rule was neither ultra vires the IT Act nor unconstitutional. \nShe opined that it was merely an apprehension by the petitioner that the FCU will be a biased body consisting of persons picked by the government and acting on its behest without any objective adjudication. \n\"It will be a great disservice to the members of the FCU to attribute bias and predisposition to them, merely on account of them being government appointees,\" the judge said. \nShe also remarked that none of the intermediaries had approached the court complaining of a 'chilling effect' or loss of immunity.\nThe judge elaborated that in the entire scheme of the Rule, there was no restriction on free speech of the user or any penal consequences to be faced by them. \n\"What the Petitioners apprehend is an indirect intrusion on their right by the intermediaries who they say, may take down their content for fear of loss of safe harbour. Enforceability of their rights lies against the intermediary, in terms of a user agreement executed by and between the parties, independent of any government agency,\" the judge highlighted. \nShe concluded that the rule could not be struck down as invalid merely on concerns of its potential abuse.\nSenior Advocates Navroz Seervai and Arvind Datar, along with Advocates Shadan Farasat and Gautam Bhatia, had urged the Court to set aside the provisions of the amendment under challenge on the following grounds:\nRules of 2023 are arbitrary and unconstitutional and the amendments do not fall within the scope of reasonable restrictions on freedom of speech provided in Article 19(2) of the Constitution. \nRules did not follow the principles of natural justice as there is no provision for show-cause notice before taking action.\nThe definitions in the Rules for what is “blatantly false, fake and misleading” and “government business” are not specific but ambiguous and over-broad; government would be a judge on the veracity of the information on social media. \nRules have a “chilling effect” - the provisions give the government “monopolistic power” to decide what information is required to be circulated about its functioning. \nThe communication by FCU is a mandate and not an advisory.\nSolicitor General (SG) Tushar Mehta, for the Union Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MEITY), had opposed the submissions of the petitioners, claiming that they had misunderstood the amendments on the following grounds: \nRules do not prohibit any expression of opinion or critical analysis against the government, but are only intended to rein in false news.\nRules were framed taking into consideration the fundamental rights of five stakeholders - the internet user, the intermediary, the recipient, the government and the public at large.\nIt neither contains penal provisions nor does it criminalise anything.\nWhen FCU flags any content to the intermediary, it does not lead to an automatic take down of the content. The intermediary had a choice to either take it down right away or just put a disclaimer that the content has been flagged. \nFCU’s monitoring was restricted strictly to the business of the Central government, which included details about the policies, programmes, notifications, rules, regulations, implementation, etc.\nSG Mehta had earlier assured the Court that the Ministry would not notify the formation of FCUs till the judgment is pronounced.\nThe said assurance will continue for 10 more days.\nSeervai along with Senior Advocate Darius Khambata and advocates Arti Raghavan, Vrinda Bhandari, Gayatri Malhotra, Abhinav Sekhri, Tanmay Singh and Meenaz Kakalia appeared for Kamra. \nAdvocates Shadan Farasat, Hrishika Jha, Natasha Maheshwari and Bimal Rajsekhar appeared for Editors Guild of India.\nDatar along with advocates Nisha Bhambani, Rahul Unnikrishnan, Bharat Manghani and Gautam Jain appeared for News Broadcasters & Digital Association. \nAdvocates Gautam Bhatia, Radhika Roy and Aditi Saxena appeared for Association of Indian Magazines.\nMehta along with Additional Solicitor General Devang Vyas and advocates Rajat Nair, Gaurang Bhushan, Aman Mehta, DP Singh, Savita Ganoo, Anush Amin, Vaishnavi appeared for the Ministry of Information and Technology."}

The Act was promulgated with the object to set at rest the controversies arising from time to time for conversion of place of worship, and the Government felt that such conversion should be prohibited … However, in the instant case, the relief sought by plaintiffs is not of converting any place of worship, but a declaration has been sought as to the religious character for part of Gyanvapi compound … According to the plaintiffs, the religious character has never changed and the Gyanvapi compound is the place of Adi Lord Vishweshwar, and by raising alleged Mosque in part of it will not change the character,\" the Court observed. \nThe Hindu parties have claimed in their suit that an ancient temple existed on the Gyanvapi compound and that the \"Hindu\" character of this land did not change even if the temple structure was later torn down on Mughal emperor Aurangzeb's orders to erect a mosque. \nThe Court observed that the Places of Worship Act does not define “religious character.\" Rather, it only defines the terms “conversion” and “place of worship.\" Therefore, questions regarding the \"religious character\" of a piece of land or structure have to be decided on a case-to-case basis, Justice Agrawal said. \nIn the present case, since there were disputing claims over the religious character of the Gyanvapi compound, the matter has to be decided by the trial court, the High Court concluded. \nUnless and until the court adjudicates upon this issue, the disputed place of worship at Gyanvapi cannot be called either a temple or a mosque, the judge added. \n\"Thus, I find that religious character of the disputed place as it existed on 15.08.1947 is to be determined by documentary as well as oral evidence led by both the parties. Unless and until the court adjudicates, the disputed place of worship cannot be called as a temple or mosque ... Either the Gyanvapi Compound has a Hindu religious character or a Muslim religious character. It can’t have dual character at the same time. The religious character has to be ascertained by the Court considering pleadings of the parties, and evidences led in support of pleadings. No conclusion can be reached on the basis of framing of preliminary issue of law,\" the judgment stated. \nTherefore, the High Court rejected petitions filed by the Muslim side challenging the maintainability of the 1991 civil suit filed by Hindu worshippers seeking rights to worship in premises currently occupied by the Gyanvapi mosque. \nThe Hindu parties had also sought the restoration of an ancient temple (Lord Vishweshwar temple) they claimed had been located in the compound. \nThe Court on Tuesday dismissed five petitions by the Muslim side, which included petitions challenging the maintainability of the suit as well as earlier orders directing the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) to survey the Gyanvapi premises. \nThe main argument by the Muslim parties which also included the Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf and the UP Sunni Central Waqf Board, was that the suit by the Hindu parties was barred by the Places of Worship Act 1991. This argument was rejected by the High Court today.\nThe Hindu side defended their 1991 suit on the ground that the dispute predated the Places of Worship Act.\nThe Court today held that even the Places of Worship Act does not contain an absolute bar preventing parties from approaching courts to enforce their rights concerning any religious place or place of worship. Rather, the Court observed that one exception to the Act is a case where a religious \"conversion\" has taken place before the commencement of the Act.\n\"Sub-Section (3) of Section 4 enumerates certain cases in which the parties can approach the court for redressal of their grievance. Sub-Section (3)(d) is one of those case, where conversion has taken place much before the commencement of the Act and a party had not approached the court, the acquiescence or silence would not bar the action of such party,\" the Court's judgment stated. \nThe Court proceeded to order the trial court to decide the matter as soon as possible, preferably in six months, considering the vital national importance of the case. \n\"The dispute raised in the suit is of vital national importance. It is not a suit between the two individual parties. It affects two major communities of the country. Due to the interim order operating since 1998, the suit could not proceed. In the national interest, it is required that the suit must proceed expeditiously and be decided with utmost urgency with the cooperation of both the contesting parties without resorting to any dilatory tactics,\" the Court ordered. \nThe Court added that the trial court should not grant unnecessary adjournments to either of the parties. In the event an adjournment is granted, it would come at a heavy cost, the Court said. \nThe Muslim side (petitioners before the High Court, defendants before the trial court) were represented by Senior Advocate Syed Farman Ahmad Naqvi and advocates Punit Kumar Gupta, AP Sahi, AK Rai, DK Singh,GK Singh, MAQadeer, SI Siddiqui, Syed Ahmed Faizan, Tahira Kazmi, VK Singh, Vishnu Kumar Singh, Zaheer Asghar, MA Haseen and Ateeq Ahmad Khan.\nThe Hindu side (respondents before the High Court and plaintiffs before the trial court) were represented by Senior Advocate CS Vaidyanathan and advocates Ajay Kumar Singh, Hare Ram, Manoj Kumar Singh, Tejas Singh, Vineet Pandey, Vineet Sankalp, CSC AP Srivastava, Ashish Kr Singh, Bakhteyar Yusuf, Hare Ram, Manoj Kumar Singh, Prabhash Pandey, RS Maurya, Rakesh Kumar Singh and VKS Chaudhary."}

The date of the arrest of the accused was common and hence they were all at par.\nHe argued that the observations made against the accused if not rectified will violate their rights to seek bail subsequently.\nAdvocate Sandesh Patil appearing for the National Investigation Agency, argued that the review petition is barred by law as the prayer sought alteration or review of the final judgment after due verification of records and hearing.\nHe also claimed that the accused were trying to bring in a new case and blame the Court when their entire pleading in the application was defective and insufficient.\nThe Bench opined that re-hearing on a point which was not at all urged, is impermissible in law, under the guise of review and concluded that no case for exercise of review jurisdiction was made out.\nAs for the apprehension that observations in the judgment under review may operate to the prejudice of the applicants, the Court clarified that the observations were based on the case pleaded, documents placed and submissions canvassed before them while deciding the said application."}

However the Bench refused the prayer.\nThe plea filed by Rane's family owned company, Kaalkaa Real Estates Pvt Ltd, sought directions to the BMC to consider the new application seeking regularisation of the bungalow situated at Juhu in Mumbai.\nThe company filed the fresh regularisation application before BMC under Section 342 of the MMC Act which stipulates notifying the Commissioner for making any alteration or addition to an existing building.\nBMC had issued a notice to Kaalkaa in March directing it to remove the alleged unauthorised work on the premises within 15 days failing which the corporation will demolish those portions and recover the charges from the owners/ occupiers.\nThis notice was challenged before the High Court pursuant to which the Court had protected the structure from demolition till June 24, until the regularisation application by Rane was heard by BMC.\nSubsequently, the regularisation application was rejected by the BMC on June 3. Since the protection granted by the High Court was expiring soon, Rane moved High Court seeking urgent relief.\nOn June 23, the High Court rejected Rane’s petition challenging the rejection order. Pursuant to this, Rane filed a second application before BMC, and moved High Court for directions.\nWhen the plea in relation to second application came up for hearing, the Court had queried whether a second such application under the Mumbai Municipal Corporation (MMC) Act would be maintainable in the first place.\nBMC responded that the company owned by Rane’s family could file a second application for regularisation which would be considered by the civic body in accordance with the provisions of existing acts and regulations.\nThe Bench, however, was not pleased with the stand as the earlier regularisation application had not only been rejected by BMC on merits but the same had been upheld by the High Court in a detailed order.\nAfter hearing the petition extensively, the Bench reserved the plea for orders concluding that since there seemed to be no opposition by the civic body, it was upon them to consider whether such unauthorised construction could be allowed by the authority or not.\nThe Bench held today that such second regularisation application cannot be considered. \n\"The petitioners or even the Municipal Corporation cannot be allowed to brush aside the finding of large scale unauthorized construction rendered by the Corporation and accepted by this Court under the guise of considering the second application made by the petitioners for retention.

[Saloni Yadav and Anr vs State of UP and Ors.]\nJustices Vivek Kumar Birla and Rajendra Kumar-IV held that the accused boy, being below 18 years of age (a minor), could not seek protection from criminal prosecution on charges of kidnapping a major girl on the ground that the two were in a live-in relationship.\nThe Court added that even generally, live-in relationships have not been given any \"protective umbrella under any law\" and that the protection, if any, is only extended to two adults in such a relationship. \n\"There can be no dispute that a child cannot have live in relationship and this would be an act not only immoral but also illegal as by itself live in relationship has not been given any protective umbrella under any law of the land except that two major persons have right to live their own life and to that extent their personal liberty is to be protected,\" the Court said.\nIn this context, the Court held that a minor person - who cannot get legal protection for a live-in relationship because he is a child - also cannot \"come forward to seek protection from any criminal prosecution on the ground of such relationship.\"\nThe Court was hearing a plea filed by a 19 year-old-woman and her 'live-in' partner, who was a 17-year-old boy.\nA criminal case was filed against the boy, accusing him of kidnapping the 19-year-old woman. \nThis prompted the couple (petitioners) to file a petition before the High Court to quash the first information report (FIR) registered against boy under Sections 363 (kidnapping) and 366 (kidnapping, abducting or inducing woman to compel her to marry) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).\nThe counsel for the petitioners claimed that the woman left her house voluntarily and that no offence was made out against the boy. However, the counsel admitted that the boy was a 17-year-old minor.\nNotably, a habeas corpus plea was also filed after the the woman and the boy were taken away by the woman's family. The woman somehow managed to escape, while the boy remained with the woman's family, the Court was told by the petitioners. \nOn the contrary, counsel for the informant argued that the offence of kidnapping was made out against the boy and that the matter required investigation. He added that the habeas corpus plea was filed on false grounds.\nThe Court noted that the boy was Muslim and reiterated that under Muslim Law, live-in relationships are not permitted, as also recently observed by the High Court's bench at Lucknow in Kiran Rawat and Anr. v State of UP and Ors.\nFurther, the Court underlined that the apex court in D Velusamy v. D Patchaiammal had held that the 'relationship in the nature of marriage' is akin to a common law marriage, which required both the parties to be of legal age to marry.\nThereafter, the High Court noted that under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO) Act, any person below 18 years of age is considered a child. As such, the Court opined that the boy could not have a live-in relationship that was protected by law. \nIn any case, whether the act of abduction made out or not against the accused boy was a matter of investigation , the Court concluded. \nThe Court proceeded to dismiss the plea, while opining that it is not a fit case for the Court to exercise its extraordinary powers under its writ jurisdiction."}
{"ID": "id_1758", "Summary": "The Kerala High Court on Thursday held that it is permissible to deal with indiscipline of employees, especially in disciplined forces, by transferring the erring officers. [Divyamol v The Director General]\nA division bench of Justices AK Jayasankaran Nambiar and Mohammed Nias CP observed that the intention behind such transfers is not to punish an employee but to relocate him/her in order to maintain discipline within the force.\n\"In a disciplined force such as the CISF, there may arise cases where the continuance of the employee in a particular station is detrimental to the maintenance of discipline at that station, and in such cases it may seem prudent to the employer to transfer the employee to a different station so that the twin objectives of maintaining discipline at one station, whilst simultaneously availing the service of the employee at another station, are achieved without casting any aspersion on the character or conduct of the employee,\" the Court observed in its judgment.\nThe bench further held that such transfers need not be interfered with by the court.\n\"Such transfers, in our view, do not call for interference from courts because they are merely measures taken by an employer in the exigencies of the service and for efficient administration thereof. There is no prejudice caused to an employee in such cases because there is no stigma cast on him/her through the order of transfer, which would affect his/her future prospects in the particular service,\" the judgment stated.\nThe Court was considering an appeal moved by one Divyamol (appellant), a Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) officer, against the judgment of a single-judge upholding her transfer from Cochin to Narsapur.\nEver since the appellant joined the CISF in 2007 under a compassionate appointment scheme, she had ensured that she would be posted in Cochin, for 13 years and 4 months of her 13 years and 11 month long career, by approaching the Court several times over the years and getting judgments in her favour. \nAs her husband was posted in Kerala since the beginning, she relied on a guideline for transfer which said that in cases where a husband and wife are both in Central government service, they have to be retained in the same station as far as possible.\nIn this round of litigation as well, she relied on the said guideline and further contended that the transfer order was punitive in nature as she had preferred a sexual harassment complaint against the Assistant Commandant. \nThe respondents, however, pointed out that as per the guidelines the appellant was liable to be posted at any place within her ‘home sector’ and this included any place within the southern sector comprising the States of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Telengana, Tamil Nadu and the Union Territories of Puducherry and Lakshadweep.\nThe Court was taken through the details of the disciplinary proceedings to show that the appellant had disobeyed clear instructions from higher authorities and had not challenged the penalty orders before any authority either. \nIt was also submitted that the appellant had not logged a formal complaint or mentioned any sexual harassment in her representation against the transfer order.\nAt the outset itself, the Court summed up the the case in the following manner:\n\"The facts of the instant case bring to the fore a classic instance of how a litigant, with the help of clever lawyers, can successfully tweak the law and the legal system in her favour, and avoid transfers and postings that form an integral part of her conditions of service.\"\nThe Court observed that it is a fairly well settled principle of service law that the power to transfer an employee in a transferable service, is within the prerogative of the employer, and more so in a uniformed service which requires maintenance of discipline within its ranks.\nIt is for this reason that courts have kept a hands-off approach in such matters, except in rare instances where the transfer is seen as vitiated by statutory violations, mala fides, either factual or legal, or where the transfer is seen as ordered by way of punishment without first holding any disciplinary proceedings to establish the guilt of the employee, the bench said.\nHowever, there is no need for an employer to first conduct an enquiry and ascertain if there was misbehaviour or conduct unbecoming of an employee. To hold otherwise would frustrate the very purpose of transferring an employee in public interest or exigencies of administration to enforce decorum and ensure probity. \nOn an analysis of the facts in the instant case, the Court concurred with the respondents and said that the decision of the employer warranted no interference from it, regardless of the appellant's constant attempts to portray herself as a victim. \n\"We do not think that merely because the respondents took note of the misconduct of the appellant at the workplace, the transfer order issued to her can be seen as punitive in nature and therefore vitiated. On the contrary, we are inclined to view the transfer as a prudent measure taken by the respondents to maintain discipline at the workplace. This is especially so when we find that the respondents herein are charged with administering a disciplined force\", the Court said as it dismissed the appeal.\nSenior Advocate Joseph Kodianthara and advocate R Kishore represented the appellant.\nAssistant Solicitor General of India Manu S and advocate P Benny Thomas appeared for the respondents."}

The applicant-wife filed a first information report (FIR) against her in-laws alleging dowry harassment. Subsequently, a chargesheet was filed against her husband and his family. \nIn 2021, the husband initiated a complaint claiming that his wife had married another man before their divorce went through. After a magistrate cour issued summons to the applicant, she moved the High Court to quash the same.\nWhile the applicant claimed that her husband's allegations were baseless, the husband claimed to have proof of the fact that she had re-married.\nUpon examining the evidence, the Court noted that there was no proof of ceremonies being completed to as to solemnise the alleged second marriage. \nThe ceremonies required to constitute a valid Hindu marriage are contained in Section 7 of the Hindu Marriage Act:\n(1) A Hindu marriage may be solemnized in accordance with the customary rites and ceremonies of either party thereto.\n(2) Where such rites and ceremonies include the saptapadi (that is, the taking of seven steps by the bridegroom and the bride jointly before the sacred fire), the marriage becomes complete and binding when the seventh step is taken.\nWith the regard to the alleged second marriage of the applicant, the Court said,\n\"...Unless the marriage is celebrated or performed with proper ceremonies and due form, it cannot be said to be 'solemnized'. If the marriage is not a valid marriage, according to the law applicable to the parties, it is not a marriage in the eyes of law. It is also well settled that to constitute an offence under Section 494 I.P.C., it is necessary that the second marriage should have been celebrated with proper ceremonies and in due form.

[Mohit Kumar v Office of The Insurance Ombudsman]\nJustice Purushaindra Kumar Kaurav considered the question of whether the couple had cancelled the trip on account of any government regulation or prohibition on February 28, 2020, since the policy barred any claim for cancellations caused due to such reason.\nThe Court noted that the only reason for rejection of the insurance claim by the Insurance Ombudsman was that the couple cancelled the trip on account of the government \"regulation or prohibition.\"\nDisagreeing with the conclusion, the Court reasoned that there was only a government \"advisory\" against international travel, and not any regulation or prohibition then.\nThe Court explained that there was only an advisory asking Indian citizens to refrain from non-essential travel to the Republic of Korea, Iran and Italy. It further opined that such an advisory cannot mean prohibition on travel to these countries.\n“In the instant case, if the petitioners, owing to the advisory and on due application of their mind, decided not to travel to Italy, the same cannot mean that the petitioners were prohibited by the Government of India from travelling to Italy,” the bench observed.\nBy way of background, the couple had availed a travel insurance policy which covered their proposed honeymoon trip to Italy and Spain in February 2020. \nTwo days before the trip, the government issued the advisory due to which the couple decided to cancel their bookings as they felt that the places they intended to visit had become uninhabitable.\nWhen they submitted their insurance claim to their insurer, Reliance, their claim was denied on the ground that COVID-19 was not covered under the policy. \nHowever, the couple argued that it was nowhere mentioned in the policy that the company would not be liable for the payment of claim if the trip was cancelled for any reason whatsoever.\nReliance did not change its stand. Before the High Court, it challenged the maintainability of the petition and argued that the couple themselves had stated that they cancelled their trip due to a government advisory. \nThe Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) also argued that the petitioners should avail the alternative remedy under Consumer Protection Act. \nAfter concluding that the cancellation was not on account of any government prohibition or regulation, the Court also held the petition to be maintainable after it noted that there were no disputed question of facts in the case.\nThe Court further observed that it cannot be laid down as a general proposition of law that the High Court cannot entertain a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution to enforce a claim under a life insurance policy.\nThe determination would depend on various factors involved in each case, the Court added.\nRelying on precedents, the bench said that if the Court finds that the insurer has illegally repudiated the claim outside the specific terms of the policy, a writ petition would be maintainable.\nIn view of the findings, the Court said that an appropriate interference was called for in the matter and that the petition deserves to be allowed.\nSince there was no other reason for repudiating the claim except the argument on government regulation or prohibition, the Court said the matter was not required to be remitted back to the Insurance Ombudsman or the insurance company for fresh consideration.\nAccordingly, it directed that the claim of the couple be honoured within a period of four weeks along with interest of six percent from the date when the claim became due.\nAdvocate Prateek Kumar represented the petitioners.\nAdvocates Prerna Mehta and Rajeev M Roy represented Reliance General Insurance.\nAdvocates Abhishek Nanda and Parul Tomer represented the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India."}

It is not the right of the Medical Board. And it is also not the right of the court to abrogate the petitioner’s rights once they are found to fall within the contemplation of the law,” the Bench held. \nRefusing the plea for termination would amount to denial of right to dignity to the pregnant woman, the Court underlined.\n“In refusing termination only on the ground of delay, this court would not only be condemning the foetus to a less than optimal life but would also be condemning the mother to future that will almost certainly rob her of every positive attribute of parenthood. It would be a denial of her right to dignity, and her reproductive and decisional autonomy,” the 23-page order stated.\nAdvocate Aditi Saxena, appearing for the petitioner, vehemently submitted that termination of late pregnancy beyond 24 weeks was not absolutely prohibited. \nShe sought court’s intervention as the statute was silent on what is to happen if late in the pregnancy a foetal abnormality is detected.\nShe further highlighted that the medical board had indeed conceded that the foetus was suffering from abnormalities but had advised against termination on the ground that it was an advanced stage of pregnancy. \nThe High Court, however, could not agree with the report as it was silent on the questions raised by the petitioner. \n“The Medical Board report addresses itself to medical interventions, the availability of incessant and ongoing treatments and nothing more. It does not take into account the social and economic position of the Petitioner and her husband. It does not even attempt to envision the kind of life — one with no quality at all to speak of — that the Petitioner must endure for an indefinite future if the Board’s recommendation is to be followed. The Board really does only one thing: because late, therefore no. And that is plainly wrong, as we have seen. Given a severe foetal abnormality, the length of the pregnancy does not matter,” the Court underscored. \nThe Court in conclusion also appreciated the restraint shown by additional government pleader VM Mali.\n“His only duty, he submits, is to bring to the notice of the Court that a certain procedure needs to be followed. His second duty is of course to assure the Court that the Petitioner will get whatever support she needs from the hospital. There will be no compromise in that regard. We express our appreciation of the stand he takes,” the Court said while allowing the plea for termination. \nRecently, the Delhi High Court had allowed termination of a 33-week-old pregnancy, stating that the choice of the mother in such cases is ultimate and final."}

{"ID": "id_1768", "Summary": "The Bombay High Court recently held that the age of consent for sex under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO Act) should be re-examined since a large number of cases coming before courts involve minor girls below 18 years who have had consensual sex in romantic relationships. [XYZ v. State of Maharashtra & Anr]\nThe Court pointed out that because of the POCSO Act, a boy aged 20 years could be held guilty of rape for having consensual sex with a girl aged 17 years 364 days. \nSuch cases were overburdening the courts and justice system, the High Court remarked.\n“The criminalization of romantic relationship has overburdened the criminal justice system by consuming significant time of the judiciary, police and the child protection system and ultimately when the victim turns hostile by not supporting the charge against the accused, in the wake of the romantic relationship she shared with him, it can only result in an acquittal”, the 31-page order said. \nThe Court observed that while children are entitled to be protected from sexual violence, they should also be free to exercise their choices without risking exposure to harm and danger. \n\"The penal approach towards adolescents’ sexuality has impacted their life to a barrier-free access to sexual and reproductive health services,\" the Court said. \nThe Court further noted that in several cases, the man is convicted under the POCSO Act, despite a clear stand being taken by the girl that the sexual relations between them were consensual. \nThese observations were made in an order acquitting a man who was convicted by the trial court under the POCSO Act for consensual sex with a girl aged 17.5 years. \nA man cannot be convicted of rape for a clearly consensual act, merely because the alleged victim has not attained the age of maturity (18 years) and because the sexual act is punishable by law for that sole reason, the Court underscored while reversing the trial court conviction.\n“The minor is not considered to be capable enough to give valid consent in the eyes of law for entering into consensual sex. In the cases of the teenagers, who fall for attraction of the opposite sex and enter into a sexual relationship, only one has to take the consequences, though the other had also indulged into the same act,” the Court pointed out while referring to the current legal position. \nThe age of consent necessarily has to be distinguished from the age of marriage as sexual acts do not happen only within the confines of marriage, the Court said. The judge added that this important aspect should be taken note of not only by society but also by the judicial system.\nJustice Bharati Dangre further noted that the present case was peculiar, as evidence showed a clear case for consensual sex since the minor had consistently maintained such a stand throughout her deposition and examination.\nThe order convicting the appellant (accused man) in February 2019 was, therefore, set aside and he was directed to be released forthwith.\nPertinently, the judge suggested that it was time to re-examine the provisions that convict individuals for having sexual indulgences with minors without considering whether the alleged victim was capable of being an equal participant in the act. \n“A provision which does not take into consideration our societal realities and proceed on an assumption, that every sexual indulgence with a minor, irrespective of whether she was capable of being an equal participant in the act, has definitely created a situation, resulting in acquittal of the accused in cases of consensual sexual relationship, where the gap in the age of accused and that of victim is small”, the High Court said. \nThe judge also referred to recent remarks made by the Madhya Pradesh High Court, which had urged the Central government to reduce the age of consent for sex from the current 18 years to 16 years in order to redress the \"injustice going on with adolescent boys\" who enter into consensual sexual relationships. \nThe Court further highlighted the age of consent prevalent in various other countries is less than the age of consent in India. The Court noted that the present age of consent in India (18 years) was probably one of the highest in the world.\nThe majority of countries have set their age of consent at 14-16 years, the Court observed. \n\"Children in the age group of 14 are considered capable of giving consent to sex in countries like Germany, Italy, Portugal, Hungary etc. In London and Wales, the age of consent is 16. Among Asian countries, Japan has set the age of consent as 13. In Bangladesh, Section 9(1) of the Women and Child Abuse Prevention Act, 2000 defines ‘rape’ as sexual intercourse with a woman, with or without her consent, when she is below 16 years of age. Similarly, in Sri Lanka, the age of consent is 16,\" Court noted.\nThe Court, therefore, asked the parliament to deliberate on this issue.\n“It is necessary that our country will have to look around and observe all that is happening around the world in this regard, but one thing is sure that in this whole scenario, if a young boy is castigated for being guilty of committing the rape on a minor girl, merely because she is below 18, but an equal participant in the act, he would suffer a severe dent, which he will have to carry lifelong,” Justice Dangre said."}

[State of UP v. Mukhtar Ansari]\nJustice Dinesh Kumar Singh set aside a 2020 order passed by the Special Judge, MP/MLA cases acquitting Ansari of the charges, on the ground that it had completely ignored the evidence of the jailor given in examination-in-chief and had only considered his cross examination. \n\"The approach of the trial Court is palpably erroneous and against the well settled legal position as discussed above. The impugned judgment and order passed by the learned Trial court is unsustainable,\" the Court held.\nThe Court noted that Ansari intimidated the complainant jailer, who was performing a public duty, by abusing him, pointing a revolver/pistol towards him and threatening to kill him.\n\"It would have invoked excitement inside the jail likely to create breach of peace, tumult and disorder inside the jail in discharge of public duties by the jail staff,\" the Court added.\nAs per the prosecution case, the complainant jailer SK Awasthi was posted at the District Jail, Lucknow in the year 2003. On April 23, 2003, some persons came to meet Ansari in jail. When the jailer refused to allow them to meet Ansari, the MLA came to the jailer's office and allegedly took exception to the same. Ansari even threatened to get the jailer killed and abused him. He then took a revolver from one of the persons who had come to visit him and pointed it towards the jailer, it was claimed.\nA First Information Report (FIR) was subsequently lodged against Ansari, after which a chargesheet was filed under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, including criminal intimidation.\nAfter the trial court had acquitted Ansari, the State moved the present appeal.\nBefore the High Court, counsel for the State contended that Ansari was the biggest bahubali of the State, facing several dozens of cases involving heinous offences.

However, Ansari's counsel did not cross-examine him on that day. Thereafter, in 2014, the jailer was recalled as a witness. This time, he fully supported the prosecution case, stating that he was won over by Ansari earlier, and that the evidence given in his cross-examination was out of fear for the security of his family.\n\"There is no legal bar for conviction upon the testimony of hostile witness, given in examination-in-chief, if it is corroborated by other reliable evidence,\" the Court said in this context, referring to a number of judgments on the issue.\nFrom the evidence on record, it is proved that Ansari took a pistol/revolver from a visitor and pointed it towards the jailer and threatened to kill him, the Bench noted.\nIt thus held,\n\"The accused-respondent is convicted for offences under Sections 353, 504, 506 IPC.

{"ID": "id_1781", "Summary": "In a significant judgment, the Kerala High Court on Friday struck down Section 10A of the Indian Divorce Act, that stipulates a waiting period of 1 year for filing petitions for divorce by mutual consent.\nA division bench of Justices A Muhamed Mustaque and Shoba Annamma Eapen opined that the mandatory waiting period affects the right to liberty of citizens, in this case Christian citizens to whom the Indian Divorce Act applies.\n\"We are of the firm view that when liberty is taken away to act according to one's will, without any procedure to safeguard the fallout of such restrictions, the law will become oppressive,\" the bench opined.\nThe bench made it clear that the effect on the rights of citizens is what has caused it to strike down the provision and not the fact that there are differences in the waiting period mandated in other personal laws.\n\"We are not holding that the law is discriminatory because of the reason that different communities in equal circumstances are given different treatment. Law intends to apply to a particular class or group and that group is not homogeneous with certain classes or groups being excluded, compelling the legislature to make different laws for each group.... But for the legislation, parties would be able to separate themselves. The legislature cannot take away liberty without adequately safeguarding the interest of the individuals whose interests to seek remedy are affected even if such legislation intends to achieve laudable objects,\" the bench elaborated.\n\"We hold that the fixation of the minimum period of separation of one year as stipulated under Section 10A is violative of the fundamental right and accordingly, strike it down\", the Court held.\nThe bench also opined that even though the legislature might have good intentions in stipulating the waiting period, it curtails the rights of spouses to judicial remedy if they suffer hardship during the waiting period. \n\"It is found that the mandate of Section 10A(1) will become oppressive if the parties are not given the option to highlight hardships and exceptional hardships they may experience during the waiting period. The right to a judicial remedy if curtailed by statutory provisions, the Court will have to strike it down as it is violative of a fundamental right. The right to life encompasses judicial remedy as well. Article 8 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights declares that everyone has the right to an effective remedy by the competent national Tribunals for acts violating fundamental rights granted by the constitution or by law. The legislature in other statutes, having felt the need for relaxation, to redress exceptional circumstances through judicial remedy, cannot remain in oblivion when concerning the Christian community,\" the judgment stated.\nThe judgment was passed on a plea moved by two young Christians who got married as per Christian rites in January this year. They soon realised their marriage was a mistake, did not consummate it, and moved a joint petition for divorce under Section 10A of the Divorce Act before a Family Court by May. \nThe Family Court rejected the petition holding that one-year separation after the marriage is an essential condition to maintain a petition under Section 10A of the Act. \nChallenging this order, both parties approached the High Court and realising that the bar is created by a statute, the couple moved a writ petition to declare Section 10A(1) of the Act as unconstitutional. \nThe Court referred to a verse from Bible at the outset of its judgment to summarise the issue at hand.\n\"“What God has joined together, let no one separate” is the sublime ideal read in the Bible (Matthew 19:6, Mark 10:9). Do spouses in that union have the right to separate their marriage, mutually, before the aura of the marriage period of one year vanishes, is the question presented in these matters.\"\nIt noted that Section 10A previously mandated a 2-year waiting period. However, the Kerala High Court itself, in Saumya Ann Thomas v. The Union of India & Ors. held that the stipulation of a period of two years as the minimum mandatory period under Section 10A was arbitrary and oppressive and the period of two years has to be read as one year. \nThis was after taking note of the one-year period stipulated in Section 28(1) of the Special Marriage Act, Section 13B(1) of the Hindu Marriage Act and Section 32B(1) of the Parsi Marriage and Divorce Act. \nSpeaking on the legislature's possible intent in stipulating such a waiting period, the Court said that it was intended as a safeguard against impulsive decisions that may permeate the decision by stipulating a gestation period before presenting a petition for divorce on mutual consent. \n\"In the Indian social context, though marriages are solemnized by two individuals, it is seen more as a union for- laying the foundation for a strong family and society. Many laws have been made and many rights have been created based on familial relationships. The legislature, therefore, decided that a minimum period of separation must precede before presentation of a petition for divorce on the ground of mutual consent,\" the Court said.\nHowever, even though the harm caused to others may have influenced the legislature, the Court noted that no remedy is provided by statute in exceptional and depraved conditions for a spouse to approach the courts to get rid of the minimum period. \n\"The denial of such a remedy to Christians bothers us. The Court must circumvent from entering into the domain of legislature by providing measures of relaxation....Individual liberty when curtailed, the Court has to examine whether the law was passed to further any common good or to protect the larger interest of the parties,\" the Court said.\nIn the context of the present case, the Court opined that the collective good intended cannot be used as a reason to trample upon the rights of individuals to depart if his or her need to depart is not relatable to the collective good. \nAccordingly it struck down Section 10A. \nIt also directed the Family Court to consider and dispose of the plea by petitioners for divorce within a period of two weeks, without insisting on their personal appearance.\nAdvocates Sikha G Nair, Sandhya K Nair, Anjana Suresh E and Beena N Kartha appeared for the petitioners while the respondents were represented by Deputy Solicitor General Manu S. \nAdvocates Sandhya Raju and R Leela served as Amicus Curiae."}

Despite repeated PCR calls, no effort was made to save him. Gujjar succumbed to his injuries after not receiving proper medical treatment.\nFurther, it was submitted that neither was a complaint lodged, nor was any evidence collected in relation to the incident. It was also claimed that Gujjar was being harassed by jail officials for not being able to meet regularly increasing demands of money made by them.\nThe Court was asked to direct the CBI to take over the investigation and provide protection to the petitioners.\nAt the very outset of the judgment, Justice Gupta noted that the petition filed by the mother, sister and brother of Gujjar was a result of a violation of his constitutional rights resulting from his death caused by custodial violence.\n“Walls of prison, howsoever high they may be, the foundation of a prison is laid on the Rule of Law ensuring the rights to its inmates enshrined in the Constitution of India.”\nWhile passing orders and directions, the High Court observed that even when the deceased was injured and alive, his life could have been saved if proper medical treatment was provided to him. Therefore, the role of jail doctors in not providing proper treatment at the right time was also directed to be ascertained. The Court thus deemed it fit to transfer the probe into Gujjar's death to the CBI.\nOn 18 August, the Court had directed the DG, Prisons and Joint Commissioner of Police to file a status report. The report was brought before the Court and amongst other things, it detailed that the CCTV cameras were shut down on the request of the agency executing the work of commissioning of CCTV cameras due to a technical glitch."}

The Appellant, who is already on bail, is set at liberty forthwith,\" the judgment said. \nThe main issue before the top court was regarding the power of the Governor to refer such petitions to the President of India when the State Cabinet had already given its recommendation for remission or pardon.\nThe Governor had refused to take a call on Perarivalan's plea under Article 161 of the Constitution prompting the convict to approach the Court. \nThe Supreme Court held that the exercise of powers by Governor under Article 161 cannot suffer from inexplicable delay and it can be subjected to judicial review.\n\"As per Maru Ram judgment, the Governor is a mere handle. We are not impressed to remand back the matter to the Governor,\" the top court made it clear. \nPertinently, the top court held that the advice of the State Cabinet is binding on the Governor in matters relating to commutation/ remission of sentences under Article 161.\n\"No provision under the Constitution has been pointed out to us nor any satisfactory response tendered as to the source of the Governor’s power to refer a recommendation made by the State Cabinet to the President of India,\" the Court held.\nThe Court broadly held the following: \n- Advice of the State Cabinet is binding on the Governor in the exercise of his powers under Article 161 of the Constitution;\n- Non-exercise of the power by the Governor under Article 161 or inexplicable delay in exercise of such power not attributable to the prisoner is subject to judicial review by Supreme Court, especially when the State Cabinet has taken a decision to release the prisoner and made recommendations to the Governor to this effect;\n- Submission that Union Government has power to remit / commute sentences imposed under Section 302 of Indian Penal Code is incorrect, as no express executive power has been conferred on the Central government either under the Constitution or law made by the parliament in relation to Section 302.\nAG Perarivalan was convicted and sentenced to death when he was 19 for aiding in making the bomb responsible for the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi.\nThe top court had, in 2014, commuted his death sentence to life imprisonment on the ground of delay in deciding mercy petitions.\nLater he applied to the Governor for pardon and remission of his sentence on December 30, 2015.\nWith no decision forthcoming from the Governor, Perarivalan moved the Supreme Court almost three years later, in September 2018. \nThe Supreme Court had then asked the Governor to decide the pardon plea as he “deemed fit”. Three days later, the Tamil Nadu Cabinet recommended to the Governor, to remit Perarivalan’s sentence and release him forthwith.\nHowever, the Governor refused to take a call on the same stating that the President is the competent authority when it comes to remission of sentence of convicts and had referred it to the President.\nThe Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) also told the Supreme Court in October 2020 that the Governor of Tamil Nadu is the competent authority to decide on request for remission.\nBut the Governor had maintained that the President is the competent authority to take a call on remission.\nThe Supreme Court by way of today's judgment rejected this argument and held that petitions under Article 161 pertain to the liberty of individuals and inexplicable delay not on account of the prisoners is inexcusable as it contributes to adverse physical conditions and mental distress faced by a prisoner. \nThe Court said that Governor ought not to have sent the recommendation made by the State Cabinet to the President of India and such action was contrary to the constitutional scheme.\nEven though Governor has immunity under the Constitution, Supreme Court has the power of judicial review of orders of the Governor under Article 161, the judgment added.\n\"Non-exercise of the power under Article 161 is not immune from judicial review, as held by this Court,\" the verdict said.\n\"Taking into account the Appellant’s prolonged period of incarceration, his satisfactory conduct in jail as well as during parole, chronic ailments from his medical records, his educational qualifications acquired during incarceration and the pendency of his petition under Article 161 for two and a half years after the recommendation of the State Cabinet, we do not consider it fit to remand the matter for the Governor’s consideration,\" the Court ordered while setting Perarivalan free."}

The past association of a judge with a political cannot be the basis for apprehension of bias.

{"ID": "id_1795", "Summary": "The Punjab and Haryana High Court on Thursday granted bail to Congress leader Sukhpal Singh Khaira in a case under the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act [Sukhpal Singh Khaira v. State of Punjab]\nJustice Anoop Chitkara recorded a prima facie satisfaction that the Congress party Member of Legislative Assembly (MLA) was not guilty of the allegations relating to smuggling of drugs.\n“The possibility of the accused influencing the investigation, tampering with evidence, intimidating witnesses, and the likelihood of fleeing justice, can be taken care of by imposing elaborative and stringent conditions,” the Court said.\nKhaira was earlier a leader of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) before he was suspended from the party in 2018. He later resigned from AAP and joined the Congress party.\nIn the case dating back to 2015, the State had moved an application in 2017 under Section 319 of Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) to summon Khaira as an accused. \nThe application was allowed and the decision of the trial court was later upheld by the Punjab and Haryana High Court . \nThe Supreme Court in February 2023 set aside the trial court order, taking note of the fact that a Constitution Bench in 2022 held that once the trial judge passes an order of sentence, it does not have the power to pass an order under Section 319 CrPC.\nThough the trial court in April dropped the proceedings against Khaira on the basis of the top court’s ruling, it permitted the investigating agency to continue with the probe to enable them to file a chargesheet under Section 173 CrPC. \nConsequently, the Director of Bureau of Investigation in September 2023 constituted another SIT to investigate the FIR and arraigned Khaira and others as additional accused. \nKhaira was arrested on September 28, 2023. Before the High Court, Khaira’s counsel contended that he was arrested only because he had parted ways with the Aam Aadmi Party which is now the ruling party in Punjab. \nConsidering the submissions, Justice Chitkara at the outset noted that since the case involves the commercial quantity of contraband, Khaira would have to meet the stringent conditions for bail under Section 37 of the NDPS Act.\nSection 37 requires the Court to provide an opportunity of hearing to the Public Prosecutor before a decision in the bail application. \nIt also states that the Court must satisfy itself that reasonable grounds exist for believing that the accused is neither guilty of the offence nor likely to commit the offence while on bail.  \nThe Court opined that satisfying the fetters of Section 37 of NDPS Act was “candling the infertile eggs”. \nHowever, it added that the twin conditions do not create a bar for bail but only create hurdles by placing a reverse burden on the accused. \n“The expression “reasonable grounds” means something more than prima facie grounds. It contemplates substantial probable causes for believing the accused is not guilty of the alleged offence. Even on fulfilling one of the conditions, the reasonable grounds for believing that the accused is not guilty of such an offense, the Court still cannot give a finding on the assurance that the accused is not likely to commit any such crime again,” the bench said.\nThus, the Court reasoned that the grant or denial of bail for possessing commercial quantity would vary from case to case, depending upon its facts.\nConsidering the record, the Court noted that Khaira was made an accused on the basis of calls with “handler from UK”, his Personal Security Officer (PSA) and Personal Assistant (PA), unexplained money and confessional statement of co-accused recorded after the decision on prosecution’s application under Section 319 CrPC.\nIn this backdrop, the Court opined that it cannot take into consideration the evidence collected and produced before the trial court “till the decision of application under Section 319 CrPC.” \nHowever, it clarified the evidence collected after the decision can be taken into consideration for deciding the bail application. \nConsidering the evidence, absence of any recovery of any incriminating evidence during Khaira’s custodial interrogation and the evidentiary value of a disclosure statement made by a co-accused, the Court said,\n“It can be inferred at this stage that for the purpose of satisfying the rigors of section 37 of NDPS Act, the petitioner cannot be said to be prima facie guilty for any allegations, and its most likely effect on the final outcome would be sufficient for satisfaction of conditions of Section 37 of NDPS Act.” \nAccordingly, the Court granted bail to Khaira subject to several terms and conditions including surrender of any weapons.\nSenior Advocate Vikram Chaudhri with Advocates Keshavam Chaudhri, Parvez Chaudhary, Hargun Sandhu, Digvijay Singh, and Rishab Tiwari represented the petitioner\nSenior Advocate  Harin P.

Absence of such circumstances, information or material which is the sine qua non for the decision of arrest reduces the provision a dead letter and renders the arrest illegal\", the court observed in its 32 page order.\nChanda Kochhar and Deepak Kochhar were arrested by CBI on December 24 on allegations of cheating and irregularities in loan of ₹3,250 crore granted in 2012 to the Videocon Group.\nThe complainant had alleged that Kochhar's husband and her family members benefited from the dealings.\nIt was alleged that when Kochhar was at the helm of affairs at ICICI Bank, she cleared a loan for Videocon Group of Companies. As quid pro quo, her husband's company Nu Renewable allegedly received investment from Videocon. The loan later turned into a non-performing asset (NPA) and was termed as bank fraud.\nAfter initial CBI custody, the special CBI court had remanded them to judicial custody on December 29.\nThe duo moved High Court seeking quashing of the case, declaring their arrest illegal and release from detention. \nA co-ordinate bench on January 9 last year ordered their interim release from judicial custody.\nThe Court also held that the arrest was in violation of Section 41A of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) which mandates sending notice for appearance before the concerned police officer.\nWhen the petition was taken up for final hearing by the present division bench, Senior Advocate Amit Desai for Chanda Kochhar argued that they are not insisting that the court quash the FIR.\nHe reasoned that the couple had filed another petition challenging the sanction granted by ICICI Bank to prosecute their former MD & CEO. \nDesai however maintained that the Kochhars had been arrested illegally and they violated the mandated procedures under the Code of Criminal Procedure. \nHe also cited the interim order of January 9, 2023 in which even the division bench had noted that the identical arrest memos of the Kochhars did not record any specific grounds for arrest as mandated under Section 41 (notice to be issued before arrest) of CrPC.\nMeanwhile, advocate Kuldeep Patil appearing for CBI, argued that the interim order only considered the arrest memo and referred neither to the case diary nor the remand application. \nHe argued that even the chargesheet against Chanda Kochhar contained evidence of non-co-operation. \nHe also rebutted Desai's contention that Kochhar had not been arrested by a female officer. He argued that male police officers are not barred from arresting females as long as there is no physical contact.\nHe added that a female officer was present when the arrest was made."}

{"ID": "id_180", "Summary": "The Madhya Pradesh High Court recently restored the ban imposed on fishing in Mandsaur's Teliya Talab citing the religious sentiments of devotees who visit temples located on the banks of the talab [Dr. Dinesh Kumar Joshi v. The State of Madhya Pradesh]. \nA division bench of Justice Sushrut Arvind Dharmadhikari and Justice Pranay Verma said that fishermen being deprived of their livelihood cannot be a reason to lift the fishing ban which was imposed by the Municipality on the ground of religious sentiments.\n\"The only reason assigned by the Collector (for lifting the ban) is that hundreds of fishermen are deprived of their livelihood. Certainly, this cannot be a reason to suspend the resolutions (imposing the ban),\" the Court said.\nLocal authorities are the ‘best persons’ to decide on imposition of ban due to public sentiments, the Court added.\nThe ban on fishing activities in Teliya Talab was first imposed by the Municipal Council on religious grounds. The Collector in 2018 suspended the resolution passed by the municipality and lifted the ban.\nA public interest litigation was then filed by a doctor challenging the Collector's decision. The petitioner said there are various temples and ashrams located on the banks of the pond. It was also submitted that thousands of tourists visit it.\nThe division bench of Justice Sushrut Arvind Dharmadhikari and Justice Pranay Verma, after looking into the provisions of MP Municipalities Act, said the resolution could have been stayed only if it were detrimental to the interests of the municipality or the public. \n“Admittedly, the fishing policy is not a statutory policy, but is merely a guideline. The local authorities are the best person to impose ban at the behest of the public sentiments,” said the Court.\nIt further noted that the resolution could also have been suspended if it were causing or was likely to cause injury or annoyance to the public or lead to breach of peace.\nHowever, the Court found that the Collector had not recorded any such findings and the only reason assigned was that hundreds of fishermen were deprived of their livelihood.\nThis cannot be a reason to lift the ban, the Court made it clear.\nRelying on a precedent, the Court also opined that the Collector could have passed the order of suspension only if the resolution were yet to be executed. \nOn the contrary, the Court found the resolution had been in force for at least five years.\n“The Collector had no authority to call for a review or to stay the resolution and further direct grant of patta. It is also not known as to how the Collector has formed an opinion that the resolution of the Municipal Council is not in conformity with law or with the rules or bye-laws made thereunder,” it observed.\nThe Court concluded that the Collector had acted beyond the powers and jurisdictions. Accordingly, the order passed in 2018 was set aside and also the appellate order passed by Additional Commissioner, Ujjain.\nSince the Court had stayed orders in January 2020, the Court said the State could not have affirmed them. Accordingly, the Court also set aside the order affirming the decision of Collector.\nAdvocate Nitin Phadke represented the petitioner\nSenior Counsel Veer Kumar Jain with Advocate Divyansh Luniya represented the Municipal Council Mandsaur\nAdditional Advocate General Anand Soni represented the State"}

{"ID": "id_1805", "Summary": "The Bombay High Court recently cautioned the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) against acting at the instance of builders after noting that one of the pleas filed by BMC seemed to have been moved to benefit a builder.\nA Bench of Justices GS Patel and Gauri Godse asked the municipal body to maintain distance from builders.\nThe plea by BMC sought vacation of an order which had stayed eviction of tenants from a temporary structure which had become dilapidated.\nThe bench observed that application by BMC was without merit as it seemed to benefit only the developer.\n“One cannot escape the feeling that this application by BMC is at the instance of the developer, to somehow or the other get vacant possession of the property without making provision for permanent alternate accommodation for the tenants. If this application is allowed, the only result is that the tenants are thrown out, the temporary transit accommodation is demolished and the developer/owner gets a bonanza of getting a completely emptied plot”, the Court said.\nIt minced no words in coming down upon the municipal body for filing the plea.\n“We are firmly of the opinion that this application by BMC is utterly without merit and possibly worse. We have put the MCGM to notice that it would be in the fitness of things if it put some distance between itself and developer/builders,” the Court recorded in its 8-page order.\nThe grievance by the tenants was that they had not been provided with a permanent alternate accommodation before issuing eviction notices.\nThe Court had, in 2018, permitted them to continue staying in the structure at their risk.\nBMC filed the present application seeking vacation of that order and directions to the tenants to evict the structures.\nThe Court noted that unlike old structures, the present structure which the civic body was seeking to vacate was a new structure temporarily built as a transit accommodation for the tenants. \nThe tenants were promised redevelopment by the owner. The old structure was torn down and the present structure was constructed till a more permanent alternate structure could be built.\nThe Court took exception to the tenants' concern of where they would go if evicted from the temporary structure. \n“The MCGM does not tell us where these tenants are supposed to go if reliefs are granted. Presumably, they are to be thrown on to the streets of the city and left to fend for themselves. The MCGM has sufficient power and authority to take action against the 4th Respondent developer and to compel it to complete the project for which it got sanction. There is no indication in the Interim Application that the MCGM has done anything in that direction,” the Court held.\nThe Court also did not agree with BMC’s submission that the structure was dilapidated as there were many such buildings which were dilapidated. \n“We are yet to see this level of enthusiasm in litigation from the MCGM in regard to other buildings that are perhaps even older and certainly far more dilapidated,” the Bench remarked, rejecting the application."}

The eighth respondent, on the other hand, has polled sixteen votes. We accordingly order and direct that the result of the election as declared by the Presiding Officer shall stand quashed and set aside. The appellant, Kuldeep Kumar, is declared to be the validly elected candidate for election as Mayor of the Chandigarh Municipal Corporation,\" the Court ordered. \nThe Court also strongly deprecated the conduct of Returning Officer Anil Masih. \nThe Court said that Masih had \"unlawfully altered the course of the mayoral election\" and that he had made statement before the Court that was a \"patent falsehood.\" \nThe Court, therefore, issued a show-cause notice to Masih.\n\"As Presiding Officer, Shri Anil Masih could not have been unmindful of the consequences of making a statement which, prima facie, appears to be false to his knowledge in the course of judicial proceedings. The Registrar (Judicial) is accordingly directed to issue a notice to show cause ... as to why steps should not be initiated against him under Section 340 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1973. The notice shall be made returnable on 15 March 2024. Shri Anil Masih shall have an opportunity to file his response,\" the Court ordered.\nThe bench was hearing a petition filed by AAP Councillor Kuldeep Kumar who alleged fraud in RO Masih's decision to declare Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) Manoj Sonkar (since resigned) as the Chandigarh Mayor on January 30.\nBJP's Manoj Sonkar was declared to have won the Mayor elections on January 30 on the strength of 16 votes against the 12 votes received by the Congress-AAP candidate, Kuldeep Kumar.\nThis was despite the fact that the AAP-Congress alliance had a majority in the house with 20 members. A total of 36 votes were cast of which 8 votes were rejected as invalid during the counting process.\nAAP councillor Kuldeep Kumar challenged the Mayor poll results initially before the Punjab and Haryana High Court. \nWhen the High Court declined to stay the election results, he moved a plea before the Supreme Court.\nNotably, while the matter was pending before the top court, the BJP candidate (Sonkar) resigned from the post of Mayor on Monday and three AAP Councillors defected to the BJP.\nThis development was taken note of by the top court on Monday which said that it was \"distressed\" by such \"horse-trading.\"\nDuring the hearing of the matter on Monday, Masih had said that he had only marked (by putting ticks and \"x\" marks) the eight ballot papers submitted by the AAP-Congress alliance to set them apart as they were \"defaced.\"\nThe Court had then ordered that the ballot papers and the video of the counting process be produced before it.\nWhen the matter was taken up for hearing today, the Court was handed the ballot papers. \nAfter examining the ballot papers, the bench noted that these ballot papers which had been crossed as invalid by Masih were clearly votes cast in favour of the AAP candidate.\n\"See, Kuldeep Kumar and Manoj Kumar.. What has been done is ... eight ballots invalidated.. all eight have received the stamp for Kuldeep Kumar.. The RO signs at the bottom and puts a single line there ... everywhere, he puts a single line.. I have a question to Mr. Masih - you said that you put the line because it was defaced ... Where has it been defaced?\" CJI Chandrachud asked.\n\"He (Masih) said that in court too! Anil Masih exacerbated the felony by repeating that before this court,\" added Senior Advocate AM Singhvi who represented Kuldeep Kumar (petitioner before the Court).\nSenior Advocate Mukul Rohatgi defended Masih's conduct by submitting:\n\"There is a small dot, if it is seen clearly ... What he has done is ... in one of them, there is a small dot ... Some (ballot papers) are folded from the top ... By virtue of a line tick, he disqualified the same and that was his assessment.\"\nRohatgi added that Masih was only seen looking up at the CCTV cameras in the counting area as there was a \"commotion outside.\"\n\"No one can do this with cameras present ... There is no guilty man looking at the camera,\" Rohatgi said.\nAfter the Court played the video of the January 30 vote count in the courtroom, Rohatgi also argued that,\n\"It is clear that the ballots were snatched by the AAP members.. There are dots and some are folded.. One may say anything but not to call someone as a thief... It was all wrong that he looked at the camera etc.\"\nThe Court, however, replied that Masih can be seen making these marks first and declaring the result, before any commotion broke out or any attempts were made to snatch the ballot papers.\nMeanwhile, Punjab's Advocate General (AG) Gurminder Singh argued that Masih's explanation of events was misleading. \n\"They ask voters to fold the slips laterally... The RO explained the procedure himself... It is on video.. He (Masih) is very well aware why dot is there and he is misleading his senior counsel. He asked for it to be folded,\" the AG told the Court.\nThe Court after hearing all parties concluded that Masih had tampered with the electoral process. Therefore, it set aside the elections results declared by Masih and declared the AAP candidate to be the winner. \nThe matter will next be taken up on March to consider Masih's response to the show-cause notice.\nAdvocates RPS Bara, Ferry Sofat, and Kuldeep Kaur also appeared in the case for the petitioner (AAP councillor).

State of Uttarakhand].\nJustice Sharad Kumar Sharma made the remark while quashing criminal proceedings initiated against a man who was booked for having sexual relations with a woman allegedly on the pretext that he would marry her. \n\"In fact, the offence under Section 376 of the IPC as of now in this modernised society is being misused as a weapon by the females to be misutilized (sic), as soon as there arise certain differences between herself and her male counterpart, and rather it is being used as a weapon to duress upon the other side for a number of undisclosed factors, and it cannot be ruled out, that the provisions contained under Section 376 of the IPC are being rampantly misused by the females,\" the judge said. \nNotably, the Court also emphasised that the question of whether a promise to marry is false or not must be tested at the inception of such promise, and not at a later stage. \nApplying this test, the Court held that the woman's complaint of rape in this case would not stand since it was made 15 years after the relationship began and considering that the relationship continued even after the accused married another person. \n\"Ultimately, the conclusion, which has been drawn, is that an element or assurance of marriage, and on that pretext, entering into a consensual relationship, the falsity of an assurance of marriage is to be tested at its initial stage of inception, and not at a subsequent stage. The initial stage, herein, cannot be said to have been prolonged for 15 years, and even continued after the marriage of the applicant,\" the Court said. \nIn this case, the relationship was stated to have begun in 2005. Pertinently, the relationship continued even after the man married another lady, the Court was told. \nAs such, the bench questioned whether the complainant woman could claim that she had not consented to the relationship. \n\"When the complainant had voluntarily established a relationship even after knowing the fact, that the applicant is already a married person, the element of consent itself imbibes in it,\" the Court opined.\nThe Court added if there is an element of consent, then the act could not be termed as rape and it would be a consensual relationship.\nThe judge further observed that the Court is called to balance equity and examine whether a woman played an active role in the relationship, to determine if the offence of rape is made out, considering the gravity of the offence, although \"it seems to be a social menace, which is normally levelled against a male.\"\nThe Court further relied on several Supreme Court rulings passed on the aspect of consent and the distinction between a false promise to marry and a breach of such a promise at a later stage, before allowing the plea of the accused to quash the rape case against him. \nAdvocate Raj Kumar appeared for the accused-applicant.

It was not proper for the High Court to entertain a PIL which is based on mere allegations and half baked truth that too at the hands of a person who has not been able to fully satisfy his credentials and has come to the Court with unclean hands,\" the Court said.\nThe Court also made it clear that such proceedings were an abuse of its process. \nThe Jharkhand High Court had earlier this year directed the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to probe into the concerned allegations after a bench led by the Chief Justice of the High Court relied on a sealed cover report from the Enforcement Directorate (ED).\nThe High Court had initially rejected the State's objection to acceptance of the sealed cover report. The Chief Justice-led Bench had directed the State to produce details of the 16 FIRs relating to an alleged MGNREGA scam, and took note of the fact that a Mining Secretary was arrested and suspended in connection with the matters.\nThe State had then approached the Supreme Court against the proceedings. The top court had on May 24, directed the High Court to decide upfront the maintainability of the PILs filed by one Shiv Shankar Sharma.\nPursuant to that, the High Court on June 3 held that the proceedings are maintainable. The State then approached the apex court against the same by way of the present plea.\nThe Supreme Court had in August, while reserving its verdict in the matter, had stayed the proceedings before the Jharkhand High Court. \nPertinently, the Court had deprecated the use of the PIL route to initiate an Enforcement Directorate (ED) probe when there was no predicate offence registered.\nIn its judgment today, the top court made it clear that it was not proper for the High Court to have entertained PILs based on 'mere allegations'. \nParticularly, when the petitioner before the High Court filed his pleas in violation of rules, in terms of not fully satisfying the judicial fora of his credentials and informing it of earlier dismissed PILs on similar facts. \nThe judgment also noted that the petitioner's earlier pleas were dismissed with costs, the same counsel had filed a similar plea in the name of another client, and that his father was a prosecution witness against the CM's father in a criminal case. \nWith respect to the mining license, the top court noted that the matter was pending consideration before the Election Commission of India, and therefore, the prayers for probe by central agencies was not maintainable. \nWith regards to the PIL alleging money-laundering, the Court said that the sweeping nature of the allegations and the locus of the petitioner made a case for it to be dismissed at the threshold. \n\" ... the locus of the petitioner is questionable and the clear fact that he has not approached the Court with clean hands makes it a case which was liable to be dismissed at the very threshold ... the allegations which were made by the petitioner are vague, very much generalized and not at all substantiated by anything worthy to be called an evidence.

Sidhu was first arrested on February 9 .\nThe Court had subsequently rejected Delhi Police's plea seeking four-day custody of Deep Sidhu and remanded him to judicial custody. \nSeeking bail in the FIR, counsel for Sidhu argued that both the FIRs contain identical offences, and since he was already on bail in the first FIR, he ought to be granted bail in the second FIR as well.\nSidhu also imputed malafides on the Police on account of his arrest within hours of getting bail in the first FIR. The arrest was ex facie, arbitrary, mala fide, it was contended, \nThe Prosecution highlighted that Sidhu had not moved the High Court for quashing of the second FIR and thus it was the investigating agency's prerogative to investigate and arrest.\nIt was further apprehended that if granted bail, Sidhu would tamper with evidence, and might help another accused who was absconding. \nThe Cour stated that a prima facie reading of the two FIRs showed that the allegations levelled against Sidhu were similar. \nOpining that fresh investigation based on the second and successive FIRs are an abuse or process and impermissible, the Court observed,\n\"The sweeping power of investigation does not warrant subjecting a citizen each time to fresh investigation by the police in respect of the same incident, giving rise to one or more cognizable offences, consequent upon filing of successive FIR’s whether before or after filing the final report. Fresh investigation based on the second and successive FIR’s, not being a counter case, filed in connection with the same or connected cognizable offence alleged to have been committed in the course of same transaction and in respect of which pursuant to the first FIR either investigation is underway or fine report under section 173(2) has been forwarded to the magistrate, is an abuse or process and impermissible.\"\nThe Court further remarked that the arrest of Sidhu in the ASI FIR clearly suggested that \"it was an attempt to defeat the bail order\" in the first FIR and was \"a grave affront to personal liberty\" and \"runs foul of rights guaranteed under Article 21\". \n\"Such vicious and sinister action of investigative authorities amounts to playing fraud with established criminal process and shows scant regard to constitutional protections enshrined, protected and cherished under the Constitution on India,\", the Court added. \nThe Court ultimately opined that Sidhu's further incarceration would bear no fruit and therefore would be unjustified. \nThe restoration of Sidhu's liberty would also not be detrimental to the investigation being conducted by the police authorities, the Court said. \nBail is subject to personal bond in the sum of Rs 25,000 with one surety of like amount.\nThe Court directed Sidhy to :\n- join investigation as and when called;\n- attend the Court as per conditions of bond to be executed; \n- not commit similar offence and;\n- not directly/indirectly induce, give the threat, or in any way dissuade the witnesses/persons acquainted with the facts of the case and also shall not tamper with the evidence.\nSidhu was represented by Advocates Abhishek Gupta, Jaspreet SIngh Rai, Jasdeep Dhillon.\nRajiv Khamboj appeared for Prosecution. \nRead the Order:"}

Hence, the DDA is unable to say on which date the DAL [Demand cum Allotment Letter] was issued except the statement that DAL was issued at address 3 [third address provided by Jain]. DDA is an instrumentality of State and is required to act fairly and in accordance with law. The actions of the DDA as noted above are malafide and arbitrary to the petitioner who has been in legitimate hope of getting a flat. The total silence on the material particulars by the DDA clearly shows the misconduct on behalf of DDA,” the Court said.\nUnder the NPR scheme, a person was eligible to be allotted a DDA flat if he or she did not own any residential house or plot in full or in part on leasehold or freehold basis in the name of his/her wife or husband or any of his/her minor or dependent children or dependent parents, minor sisters and brothers.\nA certificate of registration was issued to Jain in July 1980. After almost 17 years of the scheme, DDA held a draw of lots in March 1996 and Jain was declared successful for a flat in Rohini.\nIt was DDA’s case that a Demand cum Allotment Letter (DAL) was issued to the petitioner at his address no. 3 but he failed to pay the demanded amount.\nHowever, the Court held that sending DAL to this address was meaningless as Jain had communicated to the authority in 1988 that his new address was now in Hisar.\n“The DAL sent to the petitioner on wrong address despite the right address being on record of the DDA is no demand in the eyes of law. It was incumbent upon the DDA to issue DAL to the petitioner on the new given address 4 which was the last known address on the record of the DDA,” the Court held.\nThe Court, therefore, ordered the DDA to provide a flat equivalent to what was allotted to Jain in 1996 at the rates prevalent at that time.\nAdvocates Praveeen Kumar Aggarwal and Abhishek Grover appeared for Jain.\nDDA was represented by advocate Ajay Brahme."}

The Court also noted that the counsel representing Shekhawat was present.\n“It can be said that on the said dates the personal attendance of the complainant was not necessary to take the matter forward,” the Court said.\nShekhawat filed the criminal defamation suit against Gehlot after the Chief Minister allegedly made a statement regarding the Union Minister's alleged involvement in the Sanjeevani scam.\nOn March 24, 2023, the Court had ordered Delhi Police to investigate whether or not Gehlot actually said that Shekhawat was an accused in the scam. \nA report was then filed by the Delhi Police and Shekhawat's counsel argued that all the questions put by the court have been answered in the affirmative in the report. The Court then issued summons to Gehlot in the case.\nSenior Advocate Mohit Mathur, representing Gehlot, argued that Section 256 (non- appearance or death of complainant) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) makes it clear that the accused ought to be acquitted in a complaint if the complainant remains absent without any justifiable cause.\nIt was argued that Shekhawat had not sought any exemption from appearance for the two dates. Mathur said Section 256 of CrPC is not only applicable when the matter is at stage of evidence, but also “on every date and every stage.\"\nOn the contrary, Senior Advocate Vikas Pahwa, representing Shekhawat, said that Section 256 of CrPC is applicable only when the matter is pending for evidence, and it comes only after framing of notice. \nPahwa also said that the proviso to Section 256, CrPC clearly provides that where the party is represented by a pleader or an advocate, no orders can be passed under the provision.\nACMM Singh noted that the object of Section 256 is to protect the interest of the accused against any malafide prolongation of the trial at the hands of a complainant.\nThe Court said the discretion provided under the law can be exercised only in situations where the court believes that the absence of the complainant is deliberate and is being caused to prolong the suffering of the accused by continued trial.\nThe Court concluded this did not appear to be the case in the present matter and dismissed the application filed by Gehlot.\n“The conduct of the complainant is of immense significance and an absence on mere two dates and that too complainant was represented by his counsels and when the attendance of the complainant was not necessary for the proceedings of the day, cannot be called a justifiable ground to exercise the discretion u/s 256 Cr.PC, so as to acquit the accused,” the Court said.\nSenior Advocate Mohit Mathur represented the accused/ applicant.\nSenior Advocate Vikas Pahwa represented the complainant."}

The Court was also told that the girl's father had filed a case against the petitioner (the husband) in which he has been granted bail. \nContradicting the submissions, the State told the Court that the girl was found to be a minor and that it was a case of child marriage which is prohibited under law. \nWhen the minor was produced before the Court last month, she accepted that she had married out of her own will and claimed to be a major. She also said she wants to reside with her husband and refused to go with her father.\nHowever, her school records revealed that she is a minor, aged around 15 years.\nIn this backdrop, the Court considered whether a minor girl who marries a person with her consent can be compelled to stay at the State Girls Care Home when she refuses to accompany her parents.\nConsidering the legal position, the Court noted that both the Hindu Marriage Act and the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act penalise the performance of child marriage.\nThe Court also opined that welfare of a girl child is paramount consideration and highlighted the consequences of child marriage.  \n“The element of consent is always subservient to overall welfare of a child. Furthermore, the medical hazards in case of a child marriage cannot be overlooked,” it added.\nIn this backdrop, the Court refused to release the minor girl to the husband's custody and ordered that she will continue to remain at the State Girls Care Home. \nThe Court further ordered the Child Welfare Committee (CWC) to monitor her well being by making periodical inspections of the place.\nHowever, the Court also clarified that if at any time, the girl wants to go to her parents, the CWC shall permit her to do so by passing an appropriate order.\nAdvocate Lakshmindra Kumar Yadav represented the petitioner.\nAdvocate General PK Shahi and Advocate Prabhu Narayan Sharma represented the State."}

She was eventually found and the Court was told that she had left the house out of her own will due to some misunderstanding with her parents. \nHowever, her father raised concern that she was only found after a delay of 17 days due to the negligence of the police authorities. \nHence, he urged the Court to direct the authorities to ensure compliance with the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for cases of missing children issued by the Union Ministry of Women and Child Development in 2016.\nConsidering this larger issue, the Court proceeded to issue the following directions. \nTranslation of SOP\nThe Court ordered that the SOP as well as the Standing Orders of the Delhi Police for cases of missing children should be translated into languages widely spoken in Delhi, like Hindi, Punjabi and Urdu. \nThe Court reasoned that the same will facilitate a clear understanding of the SOP among police personnel.\nTraining modules and ready-to-use handbook\nThe Court also said that learning modules must be created for the convenience of police personnel. In this regard, it directed the Delhi Police Academy to ensure that such training modules are provided to all the newly recruited police officials in the Academy.\nIt also ordered that a user-friendly ready-to-use handbook be developed by condensing the key procedure for quick reference and be made available in each police station.\nIn addition, the Court also said that a standardised checklist must be formulated and maintained at all police stations to guide investigating officers.\n“The checklist for investigating cases of missing children must incorporate specific timeframes for the completion of each procedure. This will ensure that the Investigating officers have a clear roadmap, thus promoting accountability and expeditious resolution in such sensitive cases,” the Court added. \nTechnological advancements\nThe Court emphasised that investigating agencies must learn modern techniques of investigation to tackle human trafficking in cases involving missing children. \nIn this context, it stressed on the need for specialised training in cyber-enabled investigation techniques as well as learning from the global expertise.\nPeriodic review\nThe Court also called for a review of the SOP and Standing Orders by the authorities to ensure they meet the demands of changing times.  \nDuty of complainants\nThe Court also noted that there have been instances where parents or guardians locate a missing child but do not inform the investigating agency of the recovery.\nTo address this gap, the Court ordered that whenever a complaint about a missing children is filed, it must specifically include a provision specifying that in case the parents or guardians discover the whereabouts of the missing child, the investigating officer should be promptly and mandatorily informed within 48 hours.\nWith these directions, the Court disposed of the petition. \nAdvocates Soayib Qureshi, Sandeep Bajaj, Aparna Singhand Harikesh Anirudhan represented the petitioner.\nAdditional Standing Counsel Sanjeev Bhandari with Advocates Kunal Mittal and Saurabh Tanwar represented the State."}

Senior Advocate Shyam Divan who represented the petitioners, on the other hand, argued that all reliefs except the constitutionality of the Act survived for adjudication.\nThe High Court agreed with the petitioners and said that the other reliefs, particularly the legislative competency of the Andhra Pradesh State legislature and other reliefs, survived for adjudication.\nThe High Court opined that the question of legislative competence survived as a result of the purpose of withdrawal of the earlier Act, which was to “further study and consultation to impart further clarity for the policy of the decentralisation”. This implied that the State was till deciding on decentralisation.\n“Court is of the opinion that as the decision is imminent and as the law on the subject is clear this Court can or rather it must decide this issue at this stage only,” the order explained.\nPursuant to a detailed discussion on the issue, it was held that the State legislature lacked competence to make any legislation to shift, bifurcate or trifurcate the capital and Heads of Departments of the three wings of the government including the High Court to any area other than the capital city.\nApart from this, it was the High Court’s finding that the respondents failed to keep up their promise to the petitioners who surrendered their only source of livelihood expecting developed, reconstituted plots. It was the State’s obligation to complete the process by 2018.\nBy not doing so, they violated the petitioners fundamental right guaranteed under Article 21 and the right to property under Article 300-A of the Constitution of India.\n“When the State and APCRDA failed to maintain the trust and acted against good governance and violated the constitutional trust, the Court while exercising extraordinary jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, can issue appropriate direction to complete the development activities,” the Court stated.\nThe Full Bench addressed the question of whether a change in government could result in a change of policy or if the government was liable to continue the capital city and region development projects undertaken by the earlier regime.\nIt was clarified that change in government was not a ground for change in policy, and the current government was under a legal obligation to complete previous projects.\nThe Court took a clear stand that the Notified Master Plan could not be modified suo motu by the State government.\nWith these observations, the Court directed the State and the APCRDA to complete the process of development and infrastructure in the Amaravati Capital City and Region and provide basic amenities like roads, drinking water, drainage, electricity within one month.\nThe State and the APCRDA were directed to complete the town planning schemes.\nFurther, they were directed to handover developed, reconstituted plots in Amaravati on ground to land holders who surrendered their land as promised by the State, within three months."}

The appointment takes place thereafter by issuance of warrants of appointment. Thus sufficient safeguards exist in the system,\" the Court said. \nThe petition by Saxena is an endevaour to harass Reddy and abuse court process, the Bench said. \nThe Court also noted how the petitioner had previously filed a writ petition before the Telangana High Court making allegations against Reddy at whose instance a first information report (FIR) had been lodged against the petitioner. \nThe complaint lodged by Reddy, who was then acting in the capacity as the then Registrar (Judicial), was pursuant to a direction issued by a single judge of the Telangana High Court. This itself came about after the petitioner had filed certain petitions in which writ petitioners were found to be non-existent persons.\nThe judgement in the petition filed by the petitioner in High Court revealed these facts and contained adverse observations against the petitioner. \nThe writ petition before the High Court was, therefore, found to be thoroughly misconceived and an abuse of process of law and a counterblast to the series of criminal complaints in which persons belonging to the “so-called noble profession got involved”.\nThe Supreme Court took note of the above to observe that nothing seemed to have deterred the petitioner from filing the present petition before the top court. \n\"We are surprised as the brazenness of the petitioner now filing the present petition under Article 32 of the Constitution of India, the aforesaid being the finding against him, to now somehow see that the elevation of respondent No. 4 (Reddy) does not take place on the account of these proceedings initiated by the petitioner. This is gross abuse of process of law,\" the Court said. \nSince nothing else seems to deter the petitioner in such endeavours, appropriate imposition of costs seems to be the only solution, the Court opined. \n\"We thus dismiss the writ petition with costs of Rs. 5 lakh,\" the Supreme Court ordered.\nThe Supreme Court Collegium had on August 17 recommended the names of Reddy and six others for elevation to High Court."}

The copies of the letters in which the appellants or any one of them have been referred, record only third-party response or reaction of the appellants’ activities contained in communications among different individuals. These have not been recovered from the appellants. Hence, these communications or content have weak probative value or quality,\" the Court said.\nActivists Vernon Gonsalves and Arun Ferreira, along with 14 others, stand accused by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) of being responsible for the violence that erupted at the Bhima Koregaon war memorial in Pune in 2017. \nAccording to Pune Police and the NIA, the activists delivered \"inflammatory speeches\" which triggered clashes between the Maratha and Dalit groups at an event to commemorate the two hundredth anniversary of the Battle of Koregaon-Bhima. \nEight accused persons including Gonsalves and Ferreira had been refused bail by the Bombay High Court on December 1, 2021, while another co-accused, Sudha Bharadwaj, was granted bail.\nIn that order, the High Court had distinguished Bharadwaj's plea from those of the other eight and noted that her application for default bail was pending while an application was made by the Pune Police seeking an extension of time to file the chargesheet.\nThose who were denied bail once again petitioned the High Court contending that there was an error in the December 2021 judgment and consequently, prayed that they be granted bail.\nHowever, on May 4, 2022, the High Court rejected that plea too, stating that there was no factual error in the December 2021 judgment as claimed.\nThis led to the present appeal before the top court.\nThe Supreme Court in its judgment noted that though the investigating agencies recovered electronic devices like mobile phones, tablets, pen drives and ancillary items from the accused, no evidence has been cited from these devices which would implicate them in terrorist acts and other offences. \nAs regards the statements and documents recovered, the Court said that these were from co-accused and mere possession of the same would not constitute an offence.\n\"What we must be conscious of, while dealing with prima facie worth of these statements and documents is that none of them had been seized or recovered from the appellants but these recoveries are alleged to have been made from the co-accused. None of these literatures has been specifically proscribed so as to constitute an offence, just by keeping them,\" reads the judgment.\nThe Bench also clarified that when statutes like UAPA have stringent provisions, the duty of the Court would be more onerous. \n\"Graver the offence, greater should be the care taken to see that the offence would fall within the four corners of the Act,\" the top court observed. \nSpecifically regarding the letters through which Gonsalves and Ferreira were implicated by NIA, the Court said that the contents of the same are hearsay.\n\"In the case of the appellants, contents of the letters through which the appellants are sought to be implicated are in the nature of hearsay evidence, recovered from co-accused.\"\nThe Court further noted that the activities of the accused cited by NIA were in the nature of ideological propagation and allegations of recruitment.  \nHowever, no evidence of any of the persons alleged to have been recruited or to have joined the “struggle” inspired by the accused has been brought before the Court, the judges said.\n\"Thus, we are unable to accept NIA’s contention that the appellants have committed the offence relating to support given to a terrorist organisation. The second set of materials include the witness statements. There also no covert or overt act of terrorism has been attributed to the appellants by the three witnesses.\"\nFinally, the Court noted that there was no credible evidence that the duo committed any terrorist act to deny them bail under the UAPA.\n\"We have also observed earlier that mere possession of the literature, even if the content thereof inspires or propagates violence, by itself cannot constitute any of the offences within Chapters IV and VI of the 1967 Act,\" the Bench underscored."}
{"ID": "id_1830", "Summary": "The Calcutta High Court recently held that depriving a woman of her Stridhan or any other financial or economic resources she is entitled to, would amount to domestic violence under the Prevention of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 (PWDV Act) [Nandita Sarkar vs Tilak Sarkar].\nStridhan is gifts/ presents given to a woman voluntarily by her family during her wedding.\nSingle-judge Justice Subhendu Samanta said the PWDV Act covers within its scope, 'economic abuse.'\n\"The deprivation of petitioner to any economic or financial resources which the aggrieved person is entitled under any law is also Domestic Violence. In this case, it is the fact that the petitioner was deprived from her Stridhan articles since long, which were under the custody of the opposite parties. This fact tantamount Domestic Violence,\" Justice Samanta observed in the order.\nThe Court, therefore, quashed an order passed by a Sessions judge in Howrah who had set aside the order of a Magistrate Court granting compensation and other monetary benefits to a widow against her in-laws.\nThe Court was hearing a plea by a widow seeking compensation and monetary reliefs from her in-laws. Her husband had expired on October 29, 2010. On the second day after his death, she was asked to leave the matrimonial house by her in-laws. She alleged that the in-laws did not give her the Stridhan and kept other articles with them.\nShe alleged that while her husband was alive, her in-laws subjected her to cruelty.\nThe in-laws, on the other hand, contended that the widow herself left the house voluntarily. \nSubsequently, the widow sought compensation and other monetary reliefs under the PWDV Act by filing proceedings before a Magistrate, who allowed her plea on July 31, 2015. However, the order was quashed by the Sessions court on April 7, 2018.\nThe High Court said that there can be probably two explanations for the widow leaving the matrimonial house. \n\"First, widow may have felt very alone in absence of her husband and took cozy shelter at her father’s home; Second, there existed no good terms with her in-laws; that is the lady was not well at her matrimonial home,\" the bench noted.\nThe Court further said that the Sessions court committed injustice in not considering the entire case of the widow before him. \nFurther, the Court noted that the widow did not have any independent income.\n\"She is now residing at her father’s home at the mercy of her father. The day-to-day expenses of her livelihood is not a deniable factor. She is only to lay her hand to her father for to meet out the daily expenses. Thus the circumstances incurred and loss suffered by the petitioner is itself proved from the facts and circumstances of this case,\" the single-judge noted.\nThe argument advanced by in-laws, the Court said, has no merit on that score. \n\"Ultimately, it is the irony of fate, that instead of specific legislative intent, the widow lady is roaming doors of Courts since long 10 years without receiving any monetary relief,\" the Court stated while allowing the plea.\nAdvocates Subir Banerjee, Sandip Bandyopadhyay and Ruxmini Basu Roy appeared for the Petitioner.\nAdvocates Manjit Sing, G Sing, Abhisekh Bagal, Biswajit Mal and RK Sing represented the In-Laws."}

Sir jee”, prima facie proves that same was circulated on twitter with no intention but to cause the protesting farmers to believe that Mr. Kejriwal is supporting the farm laws, which may have perpetuated the state of outrage with the protesting farmers and may have resulted in rioting like situation across the nation,” the order stated.\nAfter going through the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) report on the authenticity of the video shared by Patra, the Court noted,\n\"The above-mentioned findings in the FSL report clearly reflects that the impugned video is opined to have been edited/altered. Therefore, the fact that the impugned video clip was a doctored electronic record stands prima facie proved.\"\nThe judge raised questions about the Delhi Police investigation in the matter, as it failed to probe the circumstances under which the video was uploaded by Patra on his Twitter handle.\n“Besides, the police has also not conducted any probe to find out whether the impugned video clip was already available in public domain by associating twitter during the inquiry, so as to rule out the fabrication/ alteration of the same at the behest of proposed accused. A thorough investigation is required to be conducted on the above mentioned aspects considering the seriousness of the allegations and accordingly, this court is of the considered view that the prayer made by the complainant deserves to be accepted and the present application deserves to be allowed,” the Court said.\nThe Court, therefore, directed the local Station House Officer to register an FIR under appropriate sections of the law and to initiate an investigation into the incident.

It is the duty of the Police and the Enforcement Officers of the Motor Vehicles Department to keep an eye on such vehicles, subject them to thorough checking, besides verifying the identity of persons in it, and initiate appropriate proceedings in accordance with law,\" the Court observed.\nThe contempt case arose from the directions of the Court in Anoop KA v KR Jyothylal in which it was also held that in view of the provisions under clause (8) of Rule 21 of the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, carrying overload in goods carriages shall constitute an act, which is likely to cause nuisance or danger to the public, for the purpose of clause (f) of sub-section (1) of Section 19 of the Motor Vehicles Act.\nIf this direction is not complied with, it is for the Transport Commissioner, the Deputy Transport Commissioner and the Regional Transport Officer to forward the driving licence of the driver of the vehicle to the Licensing Authority, for initiating proceedings under sub-section (1) of Section 19 of the Motor Vehicles Act, the Court had said in Anoop KA.\nThe said authorities filed affidavits before the Court stating that the due to Covid-19 pandemic situation, the Enforcement Officers of the Motor Vehicles Department showed leniency by not suspending the driving license except in grave offences. \nThe Court, however, said that this is in violation of the statutory provisions and also the directions contained in the judgment in Anoop KA.\nSimilarly, the Court opined that any interference with the enforcement activities of the officers in the Motor Vehicles Department, either by the Torus/tipper drivers and owners or by the office bearers of their unions, or any threat faced by such officers from their side, also requires serious consideration by the Court.\nWhen the contempt case came up for consideration in October 2021, the Court noticed that the plying of goods vehicles on public place flouting the statutory provisions and the directions of the court in Anoop KA, is likely to cause danger to other road users.\nTherefore, it opined that this is a fit case in which the Court can exercise its inherent powers under Article 215 of the Constitution of India, in order to ensure the safety of the most vulnerable road users such as pedestrians, cyclists, children, elderly persons and differently-abled persons.\nThe matter will be taken up again on February 25."}

The High Court granted him bail after noting the time likely to be taken to complete the trial. \nThe petitioner before the top court contended that the High Court completely ignored the nature of the offence, the likelihood of the accused absconding, tampering with evidence and influencing witnesses.\nThe accused had only been in custody for three months but the High Court went into the merits of the case to grant bail, it was pointed out.\nThe appeal highlighted the facts of the missing register entries and CCTV footage of the hotel where the incident took place, along with the name of the MLA's son not being there in the final chargesheet despite being named in the complaint.\nAfter hearing the parties, the Court said,\n\"The offence alleged in the instant case is heinous and would be a onslaught on the dignity of the womanhood and the age old principle of यत ननायर्यस्तत पपूज्यन्ततरमन्तततत दतवतनाताः (where women are respected Gods live there) would recede to the background and the guilty not being punished by process of law or accused persons are allowed to move around freely in the society...and are likely to indulge in either threatening the prosecution witnesses or inducing them in any manner to jettison the criminal justice system, then the superior court will have to necessarily step in to undo the damage occasioned due to erroneous orders being passed by courts below.\"\nWhile allowing the appeal, the top court directed the accused to surrender before the jurisdictional court within two weeks. The accused were granted liberty to seek bail after the evidence/depositions of the remaining witnesses are recorded, the Bench clarified.\nBefore the apex court, Senior Advocate Meenakshi Arora appeared for the son of the Congress MLA.\nAdvocates Anuj Bhandari, Gaurav Jain and Rajat Gupta represented the complainant and her uncle."}
{"ID": "id_1844", "Summary": "The Delhi High Court recently upheld the acquittal of a Muslim man accused of raping a 15-year-old girl after noting that the girl, also a Muslim, was his wife and he had sexual intercourse with her only after they got married to each other. \nA division bench of Justices Suresh Kumar Kait and Neena Bansal Krishna said that the relationship of the accused with the victim cannot be termed as rape.\nAs per Muslim personal law, a Muslim girl over the age of 15 years is competent to enter into a contract of marriage with the person of her choice and sex with such a girl is not considered an offence. \n“We find that since the child victim was the wife who was almost fifteen years of age, the physical relationship of the respondent [accused man] with the victim, cannot be termed as rape. The respondent has been rightly acquitted,” the High Court observed.\nIt also agreed with the conclusion of the Additional Sessions Judge (ASJ) that in view of the testimony of the child that she got married to the respondent in the month of December, 2014 and only thereafter did they have physical relationship, no offence under Section 6 read with Section 5(1) of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO Act) was made out.\nThe Court was dealing with an appeal filed by the State against a judgment of acquittal dated November 15, 2016 through which the accused man was acquitted of the offence punishable under Section 376 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).\nA first information report (FIR) was registered by the Delhi Police on the complaint of the mother of the child stating that in the month of October and November 2014 while the child was alone, the respondent (who was victim's sister's husband) came to her house four to five times and committed rape upon her.\nThe medical examination revealed that the girl was pregnant.\nAs the matter came before the trial court, the victim stated that the accused was the husband of her elder sister and that in the month of December, 2014 she along with her mother, the accused and his wife had gone to native place in Bihar to attend the marriage of their cousin sister. After attending the marriage ceremony, she got married to the accused. \nHer parents were, however, not aware about her marriage to the accused.\nThereafter, she along with her mother and respondent-husband and sister returned to Delhi. She further revealed that the respondent thereafter had physical relations with her on various occasions.\nAfter considering the facts of the case, the Court concluded that there was no ground to grant leave to appeal. The application was, therefore, dismissed.\n Additional Public Prosecutor Manjeet Arya appeared for State.\nThe legal issue of allowing Muslim girls below 18 to enter into a valid marriage is pending before the Supreme Court.\nThe Punjab and Haryana High Court order had on June 13, 2022 ruled that as per Muslim personal law, a Muslim girl over the age of 15 years is competent to enter into a contract of marriage with the person of her choice.\nThe Delhi High Court had also held that according to Muslim law, a minor girl who has attained puberty can marry without the consent of her parents and has the right to reside with her husband.\nIn such cases, when physical intercourse happens only after the wedlock, offences under the POCSO Act will not be attracted.\nThe National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) then filed an appeal against the Punjab and Haryana High Court decision saying that permitting such marriages would be against the POCSO Act as well as the Indian Penal Code (IPC) as per which age of consent for sex is 18. \nThe issue is currently pending before the top court."}

State of UP].\nJustice Rajesh Singh Chauhan made the observation while hearing a bail application of a person charged for sexual assault under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO Act). \nIt was brought to the Court's notice that the physical relationship between the accused and the survivor was consensual, that they had gotten married and also had a son. \n\"At the very outset, I am pained to notice this fact that a children of tender age who have not attained the age of majority are indulging in such type of relations which may not be said to be a proper relation,\" the judge said. \nThe Court also stressed that when a certain age for marriage was prescribed by the statute, any act committed prior to such age could not be approved.\n\"When a certain age has been prescribed by the statute to get married and live accordingly, any such act which has been committed prior to such age can not be approved. The age of 15-16 years or below 18 years is not the age where any young couple should enter into the institution of marriage,\" the Court observed.\nThe complaint was made by the father of a minor girl, but the girl herself did not corroborate the prosecution's story. \nIn her statement, she submitted that she was willingly living with the applicant, they had married without informing their families, and she had subsequently been blessed with a son. She also clarified that she did not wish to return to her parents. \nThe State counsel opposed the application stating that the girl was about 15 years old at the time of the incident, and a minor's consent was meaningless in the eyes of law. \nHowever, taking into account the peculiar facts of the case, the Court allowed the bail application reasoning that if the applicant was not released from jail, there was a possibility that his minor wife and son may not be taken care of properly. \n\"Therefore, considering the larger interest of the child and mother who should have been taken care of by the present applicant, the bail of the present applicant is being considered,\" the Court said.\nIt was made abundantly clear by the Court that the application was being allowed only on the facts of the case and thus, the order may not be cited as precedent anywhere.\nThe applicant was represented by advocate Ram Pukar Singh while the prosecutrix was represented by advocate Shiv Charitra Tiwari.

{"ID": "id_1846", "Summary": "The Nagpur Bench of the Bombay High Court on Friday acquitted former Delhi University professor GN Saibaba in an alleged Maoist links case [Mahesh Kariman Tirki v State of Maharashtra].\nA bench comprising Justices Rohit Deo and Anil Pansare rendered the judgment and allowed an appeal filed by Saibaba challenging a 2017 decision of the trial court convicting and sentencing him to life imprisonment.\nPertinently, the acquittal was based on the fact that the Sessions Court framed charges against Saibaba in the absence of sanction from the Central government under Section 45(1) of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.\nThe division bench recorded that while terrorism poses an ominous threat to national security and every legitimate weapon in the armoury must be deployed against it, a civil democracy cannot sacrifice procedural safeguards afforded to the accused.\n“We are inclined to hold, that every safeguard, however miniscule, legislatively provided to the accused, must be zealously protected,” the judgment said.\nAny aberration of such safeguards would only be counterproductive, the Court further highlighted, saying that departure from due process of law fosters an ecosystem in which terrorism burgeons.\n“The siren song that the end justifies the means, and that the procedural safeguards are subservient to the overwhelming need to ensure that the accused is prosecuted and punished, must be muzzled by the voice of rule of law,” the Court opined.\nNonetheless, the Court took note of the request of the prosecution urging that if the appeal was not decided on merits, and only on the point of sanction, they may be given the liberty to obtain proper sanction and try the accused.\n“In view of the well-entrenched position of law, that the rule against double jeopardy has no application if the trial is held vitiated due to invalidity or absence of sanction, we see no reason to dilate any further on the said submission,” the bench said.\nA Sessions Court in Gadchiroli had, in March 2017, convicted Saibaba and the others for alleged Maoist links and for indulging in activities amounting to waging war against the country.\nThe Sessions Court had held that Saibaba, along with two other accused, possessed naxal literature with the intent and purpose of circulation amongst underground naxlites at Gadchiroli and residents of the district with the aim to incite the people to resort to violence.\nFurther, the court had negated the submission that the absence of sanction to prosecute Saibaba was fatal to the case of the prosecution.\nIt was also observed by the Sessions Judge that no leniency could be shown to Saibaba in view of his 90 per cent disability since he was mentally fit and was part of a think tank of the banned organisation which had brought the industrial and other development in the naxal affected areas to a grinding halt.\nBefore the High Court, Saibaba’s counsel contended that the absence of sanction at the time of framing charge and recoding evidence rendered the proceedings null and void.\nFurther, the bench was informed that while he did challenge the validity of the sanction that came after cognizance was taken, the Sessions judge deferred the consideration on the aspect. \nThe respondents, on the other hand, said that the trial did not proceed in the absence of sanction, but on the basis of sanction obtained at belated stage.\nThe High Court after examining the rival contentions overturned the decision.\nIt insisted that all procedural safeguards must be followed and, therefore, acquitted all accused persons of the offences under UAPA.\n“In view of the findings recorded by us, we hold that the proceedings in Sessions Trials 30/2014 and 130/2015 are null and void in the absence of valid sanction under Section 45(1) of the UAPA, and the common judgment impugned is liable to be set aside, which we do order,” the High Court ordered.\nIt also took a poor view of an observation in the Sessions Court judgment saying that imprisonment for life was not a sufficient punishment to the accused, and the hands of the Court were tied in view of the fact that it was the maximum statutorily provided punishment.\n“We do not approve of the unwarranted observations of the learned Sessions Judge, which may have the unintended consequence of rendering the verdict vulnerable to the charge of lack of dispassionate objectivity,” the High Court recorded.\nSenior Advocate Subodh Dharmadhikari, Advocates Pradeep Mandhyan, Barunkumar, HP Lingayat and NB Rathod appeared for the appellants.\nSenior Advocate Siddharth Dave and Assistant Special Public Prosecutor HS Chitaley appeared for the State."}

The man later created a fake account on Facebook and posted the pictures.\nWhile hearing the bail plea moved in the criminal case registered over the same, Justice Kunhikrishnan noted that the main grievance of the victim now concerned the photos circulated by the accused online. \nThe Judge observed,\n\"In such circumstances, considering the special facts and circumstances of the case, if bail is granted, why not there be a condition in the bail order directing the petitioner not to use social media like FaceBook, Whatsapp, Twitter, Instagram etc., till the case is finally concluded?\"\nHe went on to point out that in appropriate cases, Sections 439 and 437 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) allow the High Court or the Session Courts to impose reasonable conditions for the grant of bail depending on the facts of the case and in the interest of justice. . \n\"There cannot be a straight jacket formula regarding conditions that can be imposed in a bail order. Each case is to be decided separately, considering the facts and circumstances of that particular case. But the conditions imposed in a bail order should be reasonable and effective in the pragmatic sense, but of course, the condition should not defeat the bail order itself\", Justice Kunhikrishnan explained. \nAs such, the Court ruled,\n\"There is nothing wrong in imposing a condition that the accused shall not use social media like Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter, Instagram etc., till the investigation is completed. With such a condition, this bail application can be allowed.\"\nThe bail plea was allowed in view of the principle that bail is the rule and considering the age of the prisoner, the time spent in jail and the present COVID-19 pandemic. \nIn view of his earlier observations, the Court also added the following as a bail condition for the accused:\nKerala HC bars rape-accused from using Social Media pending investigation for bail to protect victim's privacy https://t.co/ix0obZnENJ"}

The jail doctor or for that matter, a civil hospital may not be fully equipped to handle a patient having multiple ailments who apart from medical treatment may require a certain level of monitoring, care and attention which ordinarily is not available in jail.\"\nConsidering the co-morbidities of the petitioner, he falls in the exception of being “sick” as carved out in Section 45 PMLA, so as to be entitled to bail, the Court held.\nThe petitioner was accused of running a ₹3,000 crore Ponzi scheme in different states, allegedly cheating 33 lakh people in the process. According to ED, the man reaped benefits of ₹53 crore through the scam.\nHowever, the petitioner claimed to be a software developer and stated that all such payments were professional fees paid to him.\nCounsel for the petitioner submitted that his client weighs 153 kilograms, has various medical issues and that his health was deteriorating by the day.

{"ID": "id_1851", "Summary": "The Delhi High Court recently held that a man cannot be granted divorce merely because he has been acquitted by a criminal court in a case of cruelty filed by his wife.\nSuch acquittal does not wash away the cruelty he committed on her by being involved with another woman during the subsistence of his marriage, a division bench of Justices Suresh Kumar Kait and Neena Bansal Krishna said.\n“Merely because there is an acquittal by a criminal court, does not wash away the cruelty committed by the appellant [husband] of being involved with a young girl during the subsistence of his marriage with the respondent; mere acquittal in a criminal case cannot be a ground to grant divorce,” the Court held.\nIt observed that marital bonds are delicate emotional human relationships and involvement of any third person could result in complete collapse of trust, faith, and tranquility.\n“Any sort of influence by a third person can just be a silent destroyer of the bond, leading to prolonged irreconcilable differences. Such relations eventually become a ticking time bomb, where feelings of anguish, despair, rejection and disappointment get trapped and post explosion, the shrapnel of these suppressed feelings causes injury to everyone involved, whether directly or indirectly,\" the Court stated.  \nThe Court made the observations while dealing with a plea filed by a man against the family court order denying him divorce.\nThe couple had gotten married in the year 1982 and had two children. They started living separately in the year 1994.\nVarious allegations were made by the couple against each other.

It was submitted that the groups associated with the rights of the tribal community were not a party to the writ petition in which the direction was passed.\nIt was argued that Justice Muralidharan’s judgment has adversely affected the fundamental rights as well as the constitutional rights of the 34 recognized Tribes of Manipur. \nSenior Advocate Colin Gonsalves, representing the five applicants, argued that the Meitei community being dominant and advanced economically, politically and educationally will grab a majority of the ST reserved seats including in the Legislative Assembly.\nIt was also submitted that most of the land in the hills are owned by the tribals and if the Meitei community gets ST status they will attempt to grab the land and other resources in the hill areas.\nOpposing Gonsalves’ submissions, the Additional Advocate General M Devananda argued that the single-judge had merely directed the State to submit recommendation for inclusion of the Meitei community in the ST list. \nSubmitting there was a lengthy process for such inclusion, the State said the application seeking leave to challenge the single-judge judgment was based on unfounded apprehension and intended to delay its implementation. \nThe original petitioners - in whose case the direction was passed by the single-judge, argued that no rights of the groups representing the tribal community were adversely affected by the judgment.\nHowever, the Court said it was inclined to grant the permission sought by the applicants and directed the registry to list the connected appeal for admission hearing.\nIn May this year, the Supreme Court had pulled up the High Court for its March 27 decision, since it had triggered large-scale violence in the State including horrific crimes against women.\nA bench of Chief Justice of India (CJI) DY Chandrachud and Justices PS Narasimha and JB Pardiwala had said that the judgment was \"factually incorrect\" and also against the principles laid down by the Supreme Court Constitution bench judgments as regards classification of communities as Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes.\nHowever, the top court had stopped short of staying the decision as it was informed that the appeal had been filed against Justice Muralidharan’s decision.\nPertinently, Justice Muralidharan was transferred to Calcutta High Court this month and Delhi High Court judge Justice Siddharth Mridul took oath as the permanent Chief Justice of Manipur High Court on Friday. \nSenior Advocate Colin Gonsalves and Wungpam Yangya represented the applicants\nAdditional Advocate General M.

{"ID": "id_1856", "Summary": "The Kerala High Court recently ruled that a Registrar for Births, Deaths and Marriages need not insist on court order to record a divorce obtained through talaq under Muslim personal law [Neyan Veettil Behsana v. Local Registrar for Births and Deaths & Marriages].\nJustice PV Kunhikrishnan said that if the divorce is otherwise in order as per the personal law, a Muslim woman need not be sent to court for recording talaq and the Registrar concerned can record the talaq himself. \nThe ruling came after the Court noticed a gap in the Kerala Registration of Marriages (Common) Rules, 2008 which does not provide for the registration of divorces that are obtained under personal law.\nThis, the Court said, would put only divorced Muslim woman to disadvantage and not divorced Muslim men because if a Muslim husband pronounces talaq in accordance with his personal law, he can remarry without removing the entry in the register of marriage maintained under the 2008 Rules, because his personal law permits more than one marriage in certain situations. However, the divorced Muslim woman cannot remarry till the marriage entry as per the 2008 Rules is removed by approaching a competent court of law. \n\"If a law abiding Muslim couple registered their marriage as per Rule 2008 and subsequently the husband pronounce talaq, can the registration of marriage as per Rule 2008 be a burden to the Muslim women alone? \", the Court asked. \nThe Court opined that the power to register divorce is ancillary to the power to record marriage and, therefore, held that Registrars need not wait for court orders to record divorces that were obtained under personal law.\n\"If there is the power to register the marriage, the power to record the divorce is also inherent and ancillary to the authority who registers the marriage, if there is a divorce under the personal law. A divorced Muslim woman need not be sent to a court of law for recording the talaq if it is otherwise in order as per the personal law. The officer concerned can record the talaq without insisting on a court order,\" the Court held. \nThe Court also deemed it fit to suggest that the legislature look into fixing the lacuna in the 2008 laws. \nThe judgment was rendered on a petition moved a woman whose marriage to her husband (arrayed as the third respondent) was dissolved in 2014 upon his pronouncement of talaq. \nThey intimated the Mahal Khazi of the same and he issued a divorce certificate. The petitioner approached the Local Registrar of Births Deaths and Marriages, the same one that had registered her marriage, seeking to make necessary entries in the marriage register regarding the dissolution of marriage.\nHowever, the Registrar refused to do the same pointing out that the 2008 Rules, under which the marriage was registered did not have any provision that would allow it.\nThis prompted the petitioner to approach the Court seeking directions to the registrar to record the divorce.\nSince there is no provision in the 2008 Rules to record the divorce, the Court opined that the principle in the general power under Section 21 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 can be adopted.\nSection 21 of the General Clauses Act says that, where by any Central Act or Regulation, a power to issue notifications, orders, rules or bye-laws is conferred, then that power includes a power exercisable in the like manner and subject to the like sanction and conditions (if any), to add to, amend, vary or rescind any notifications, orders, rules or bye-laws so issued. \nAccordingly, it held that Registrars can register divorces obtained by talaq without court orders.\nThe Registrar in this case was directed to consider the application moved by the petitioner to record her divorce, after issuing notice to the husband. If the husband confirms the divorce, the Registrar shall make the necessary entry in the Register of Marriage, the Court ordered. \nThe petitioner was represented by advocates KV Pavithran and Jayanandan Madayi Puthiyaveettil.\nGovernment Pleader BS Syamantak appeared for the State."}
{"ID": "id_1858", "Summary": "A Bengaluru court recently directed two separate criminal cases to be registered against founder Chairman of Wipro Azim Premji and others for alleged criminal breach of trust and corruption [India Awake for Transparency v. Azim Hasham Premji & Ors].\nSpecial Judge under the Prevention of Corruption Act (PCA) Lakshminarayana Bhat K stated that a prima facie case was made out against Premji, his wife and one PV Srinivasan. The order stated,\n\"It is made out from the materials placed on record that the accused No.1 to 3 were performing the public duty and therefore they are public servants. There are sufficient materials to proceed against the accused in both the complaints for the offence punishable under section 13(1)(d) of the PC Act and Sections 409 and 120B read with section 34 of the Indian Penal Code.\"\nThe complaint was filed by a non-profit India Awake for Transparency, represented by its volunteer P Sadanand Goud. It was alleged that Premji and others committed offences under Sections 13(1)(d) (public servant obtaining pecuniary advantage) with 13(2) (punishment for criminal misconduct by a public servant) of the PCA and Sections 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant) and 120B (Punishment of criminal conspiracy) read with Section 34 (acts done by several persons with common intention) of the Indian Penal Code.\nThe complainant alleged that the accused took advantage of their position as directors of three companies - Vidya Investment and Trading Company Pvt. Ltd, Regal Investment and Trading Company Private Limited, and Napean Trading and Investment Company Private Limited - to remove 21.3 crore equity shares of Wipro (worth ₹9260.18 crores as on the date of removal) held by the three companies and transferred them to the Azim Premji Trust. \nThe Court noted that as per Section 2(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, public duty means any duty in discharge of which the State, the public or the community at large has an interest. Since the accused were discharging public duties as directors of the three companies, they were performing a public duty, and were therefore, public servants, the Court held.\nWhile noting that it was not required to ascertain the veracity of the allegations made in the complaint at this stage, the Court recorded in its order,\n\"The accused No1 to 3 as directors of the three companies were entrusted with the property/assets of those companies. They were having dominion over the property have dishonestly misappropriated and converted to their use by transferring the assets to the 4th accused trust in pursuance of criminal conspiracy. The complaint allegations disclose the elements of criminal misconduct.\"\nFinding that there were elements of criminal misconduct in the allegations, the Court ordered for two cases to be initiated against the accused. Thus, summons were issued to the accused, returnable by February 28.\nAdvocate R Subramanian appeared for the complainant.\nEarlier this month, the Karnataka High Court had sentenced two representatives of India Awake for Transparency to two months of simple imprisonment and a fine of ₹2,000 for filing multiple, frivolous cases against Wipro and Azim Premji.\nIn February 2021, a single-judge Bench of the Karnataka High Court dismissed another petition by the same NGO with costs of ₹10 lakh for filing multiple petitions seeking to register a case against Premji and others.\nThe Bench of Justice PS Dinesh Kumar noted that multiple petitions were moved before the High Court seeking criminal action against the Wipro Chairman, and that even after those petitions were dismissed, the NGO filed a fresh writ petition with similar set of allegations.\nWhile rejecting the writ petition, the Court noted:\n\"...there remains no doubt that petitioner is indulging in forum shopping on the very same cause of action. As held in Udyami this amounts to criminal contempt as the core issue in all these writ petitions is one and the same… In the result, this writ petition is not only devoid of merits, but an absolute abuse of process of law. Though petitioner was forewarned, he chose to argue this writ petition as a stand-alone petition wasting the valuable time of this Court to deal with such frivolous cases. Therefore, imposition of punitive cost is necessary.\""}

They started living separately in 2007.\nThe woman had levelled several allegations against her husband’s family including demands of dowry and that her father-in-law tried to rape her.\nAfter considering the case, the Court said that allegations of rape, on the face of it, appeared to be false as there were multiple instances where the parties went to the police station when this incident never found any mention.\nThe bench said that once the marriage has broken down beyond repair, it would be unrealistic for the law not to take notice of the fact, and it would be harmful to society and injurious to the interests of the parties.\n“The court, no doubt, should seriously make an endeavour to reconcile the parties; yet, if it is found that the breakdown is irreparable, then divorce should not be withheld. The consequences of preservation in law of the unworkable marriage which has long ceased to be effective are bound to be a source of greater misery for the parties,\" the Court said.\nThe Court further opined that the family court ought to have visualised that the preservation of such a marriage is totally unworkable and that it would be a greater source of misery for the parties.\n“We conclude that in the present case; the parties are living separately for 17 years now; there is no chance of reconciliation between the parties and such long separation peppered which false allegations, Police reports and criminal trial has become a source of mental cruelty and any insistence to continue this relationship would only be inflicting further cruelty upon both the parties. The marital discord between the parties has pinnacled where there is a complete loss of faith, trust, understanding and love between the parties. The parties cannot be reasonably expected to live with each other anymore.”\nThe bench, therefore, dissolved the marriage by a decree of divorce under Sections 13(1)(ia) and 13(1)(ib) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1956.\nAdvocates Ranjit Kumar Dubey and Piyush Nagpal appeared for the appellant-husband.\nAdvocate Praduman Kumar Aggarwal represented the wife."}

She would say that their house is not a 'Dharmashala', the court was told.\nOn the other hand, the wife claimed that she was subjected to ill-treatment and torture and that her in-laws demanded dowry from her.\nShe further submitted that her husband had threatened her of dire consequences. Therefore, she did not desire to live with him under the same roof.\nThe husband thus petitioned a family court seeking divorce on grounds of cruelty, alleging that the wife always picked up fights with him over trivial issues.\nThe family court had granted a decree of divorce to the husband on the ground of cruelty after noting that during counselling sessions, the couple had failed to reconcile their discord.\nHowever, the High Court found that the wife appeared to have been threatened by her husband and in-laws, due to which she was compelled to leave the matrimonial house. It noted that the husband had failed to produce any material to show that his wife did not respect his parents or that she insisted that he should leave his parents. \n\"It cannot be presumed by mere bald statement of husband that his parents were subjected to torture by the wife,\" the bench opined.\nThe Court proceeded to find that the husband's conduct indicated that he had misbehaved with his wife.\n\"The husband cannot be allowed to take advantage of his own deeds and looking to the nature of allegations which have been stated by him except the trivial facts, it appears that no severe allegations have been made against the wife,\" the Court said. \nThe Court proceeded to quash the divorce decree awarded by the family court, after noting that the husband's claim that he had been deserted by the wife was not sufficiently proved. \nSenior Advocate Fouzia Mirza along with Advocate Navin Shukla appeared for the wife.\nAdvocates Shashank Thakur and Priyanka Rai Mishra represented the husband."}

{"ID": "id_1867", "Summary": "In a judgment which could have serious impact in the arena of voting and election rights, the Manipur High Court recently held that casting of votes is a part of the voter’s right to freedom of speech and expression under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution of India [Thounaojam Shyamkumar vs Lourembam Sanjoy Singh].\nJustice MV Muralidaran, who was recently transferred to the Calcutta High Court, made the observation in a decision dated October 13 in the context of a voter’s right to know about an electoral candidate’s criminal antecedents.\n“Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution of India provides for freedom of speech and expression. Voters’ speech or expression in case of election would include casting of votes, that is to say, voter speaks out or expresses by casting vote,” the Court said.\nIt added that the voter’s right to know the antecedents, including criminal past of the candidate contesting election for MP or MLA is much more fundamental and basic for survival of democracy.\n“The voter may think over before making his choice of electing law breakers as law makers,” Justice Muralidaran who was Acting Chief Justice at the time of decision said.\nThe Court made the observations while rejecting Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Member of Legislative Assembly (MLA) Thounaojam Shyamkumar’s petitions for dismissal of his election from Andro Assembly Constituency during the 2022 Legislative Assembly Election.\nThe legal character of right to vote has been a subject of debate since the time of inception of the Constitution. \nIt has, up until now, not been recognised as fundamental right but has mostly been restricted as a legal/ statutory right by various judicial pronouncements.\nInterestingly, Justice Ajay Rastogi in a Constitution Bench judgment in Anoop Baranwal v. Union of India earlier this year in his separate but concurring opinion said that right to vote is a fundamental right.\n“The right to vote is an expression of the choice of the citizen, which is a fundamental right under Article 19(1)(a). The right to vote is a part of a citizen's life as it is their indispensable tool to shape their own destinies by choosing the government they want. In that sense, it is a reflection of Article 21,” the then Supreme Court Judge said. \nHowever, in the same judgment, the majority led by Justice KM Joseph chose not to “finally pronounce” on this aspect, while taking into account the view taken by an earlier Constitution Bench in Kuldip Nayar  and  Others  v. Union of India  and Others \nIn Kuldip Nayar, the top court had rejected the view that “right to  vote is a constitutional right besides that it is also a facet of  fundamental right under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution.” \nHowever, a division bench of the Supreme Court later in July this year described as paradoxical the fact that the right to vote has not been recognised as a fundamental right in India, despite democracy being an essential facet of the Constitution.\n“Democracy has been held to be a part of one of the essential features of the Constitution. Yet, somewhat paradoxically, the right to vote has not been recognized as a Fundamental Right yet; it was termed as a “mere” statutory right.\"\nPresent Case\nShyamkumar’s election was challenged by the runner-up candidate Lourembam Sanjoy Singh and his brother Lourembam Sanjit Singh on the ground of non disclosure of information regarding the pendency of a criminal case against him.\nThe petition also alleged improper declaration of information regarding Shyamkumar’s wife's non-agricultural land. \nAfter hearing the parties, the Court observed that whether the case said to have been registered against the Shyamkumar was deliberately omitted from the FORM-26 at time of filing of nomination papers has to be decided during the trial. \n“At this stage, this Court cannot come to a conclusion that since the investigation is pending, it is not necessary to mention in the Form-26 affidavit,” it said.\nThe Court made a similar observation with regard to mentioning of non-agricultural land and agricultural land in the relevant columns.\n“Whether the alleged false affidavit would amount to violation of the provisions of Section 33 of the RP Act so as to render the election of the first respondent void are to be considered by the Court in the course of trial,” Justice Muralidharan opined.\nRejecting the MLA’s petitions, the Court concluded that it cannot be said that election petitions against him do not contain a concise statement of material facts.  \n“In fact, the election petitions disclose cause of action,” the Court said.\nIt further observed that an election vitiated by reason of corrupt practices, illegalities and irregularities as mentioned in Sections 100 and 123 of the Representation of People Act cannot obviously be recognized and respected as the decision of the majority of the electorate.\nObserving that the Courts are duty bound to examine such allegations, the bench said they cannot be “unduly hyper-technical” in their approach and oblivious of the ground realities.\nAdvocate M Gunedhor represented MLA Thounaojam Shyamkumar\nSenior Advocate HS Paonam and Advocate BR Sharma represented the respondents"}

The mere fact that Hindu Marriage Act and the Special Marriage Act refer to cruelty without any rider or explanation or the fact that the Divorce Act and the Dissolution of Muslim Marriage Act give indication of the nature of matrimonial cruelty that ought to be established, cannot justify the conclusion that the nature of matrimonial cruelty which would entitle the spouses for divorce is different under different personal laws,\" the Court said.\nSignificantly, the Court explicitly stated that it is not in agreement with the theory that what constitutes cruelty to grant divorce can be different for persons belonging to different religions. \n\"We discard the theory that the concept of matrimonial cruelty to entitle a spouse for divorce can be dissimilar and different for persons belonging to different religious faiths merely because different words are used in the relevant personal law statutes,\" the judgment said.\nLaw cannot recognise different varieties of cruelty as Hindu cruelty, Muslim cruelty, Christian cruelty or secular cruelty to justify a decree for divorce.\nKerala High Court\nTherefore, the Court opined that matrimonial cruelty must have a uniform definition to justify the founding of a decree for divorce. \nUnder Section 10(1)(x) of the Divorce Act, the cruelty must be such as to cause reasonable apprehension in the mind of the petitioner, spouse that it would be harmful or injurious for the petitioner to live with the respondent. \nHowever, the expression harmful or injurious cannot be limited to physical harm or injury, the Court said. \n\"Anything that would hinder the ability of the spouse to blossom into his/ her fullness and to enjoy life in matrimony must be held to fall within the sweep of Section 10(1)(x) of the Divorce Act. Cruelty which is not defined in S.13(1)(1a) of the Hindu Marriage Act and S.27(1) of the Special Marriage Act and cruelty which is explained in S.2(viii) of the Dissolution of Muslim Marriage Act and S.10(1)(x) of the Divorce Act must all take inspiration from such understanding of matrimonial cruelty,\" the Court further said.\nWe discard the theory that the concept of matrimonial cruelty to entitle a spouse for divorce can be dissimilar and different for persons belonging to different religious faiths merely because different words are used in the relevant personal law statutes.\nKerala High Court\nThe Court passed the judgement on an appeal filed by a wife against the the decree of the family court which had granted divorce on the husband's application on the grounds of cruelty and desertion against her. \nThe couple had married as per Christian rites and ceremonies in 1998 and had two daughters before the husband filed for divorce in 2009 which was granted by the family court in 2015. \nThe main allegation of the husband was that from the inception of the marriage itself, his wife exhibited behavioural disorders which often turned violent and abusive. He also argued that his wife was inattentive to the children and that since 2005, she lived at her paternal house and ignored their children. \nPertinently, he contended that even though the wife had been taken to various psychologists and psychiatrists, she did not co-operate or complete any course of treatment.\nThe appellant wife however, stated that the allegations made by the husband were false and that she was ill-treated by him and his mother. It was that ill-treatment which caused mental stress for which she consulted doctors, she contended. \nFor the High Court, the main consideration was what can be construed as cruelty in the confines of matrimonial life, which it opined has to discerned on a case-to-case basis. \n\"Cruelty can be physical and mental. Physical cruelty provides more of a direct evidence, that it can be perceptible when compared to mental cruelty. Mental cruelty can be drawn from the facts and circumstances of the case, whereas physical cruelty can be drawn from the conduct of one spouse towards other spouse which endangers the other spouse's physical health,\" the Court said.\nThe Court primarily relied on the judgement of the Supreme Court in Samar Ghosh v Jaya Ghosh which elaborately discussed the nature and scope of mental cruelty as a ground of divorce.\nThe top court had also observed that the concept of mental cruelty cannot remain static. \n\"It is bound to change with the passage of time, impact of modern culture through print and electronic media and value system etc. etc. What may be mental cruelty now may not remain a mental cruelty after a passage of time or vice versa,\" the Court stated.\nIn the instant, the Court noted that even the daughters of the couple had testified in support of the allegations of cruelty made by the husband. \nFurther, a psychiatrist that the wife had consulted also testified that she suffered from an impulse control disorder but that the appellant had not completed her treatment. \nTherefore, the Court held that while one may suffer from mental stress or strain due to very many reasons, not taking treatment for the same in order to bring out a peaceful and harmonious family atmosphere, also may have to be counted as cruelty.\nOn these grounds and on consideration of the facts and circumstances of the case, the Court dismissed the wife's appeal."}

The Court further observed that the wife had expressed that she did not want to live with the stigma of being called a “divorcee” woman.\nConsidering this aspect, the Court opined that if divorce is granted on the ground of there being an irretrievable breakdown of marriage, then it would amount to injustice to the wife.\n\"In contemporary society, it may not constitute to be stigma but here we are concerned with the respondent’s (wife) own sentiment. Under the circumstances, considering and respecting the sentiments of the respondent wife exercising the discretion in favour of the appellant under Article 142 by dissolving the marriage between parties on the ground that the marriage has irretrievably broken down, would not be doing 'complete justice' to the parties, would rather be doing injustice to the respondent,\" the Court said. \nThe Court was hearing a plea filed by an 89-year-old man for divorce. \nThe Supreme Court was told that the couple's relationship had turned sour when the husband, who had served in the Indian army, was stationed in Madras (now Chennai) in January 1984 and the wife chose not to accompany him. Instead, she opted to reside initially with her husband's parents and later with her son.\nThe husband eventually sought divorce on the ground that his wife's refusal to join him in Chennai indicated her intention to permanently terminate cohabitation without justifiable grounds.\nA district court initially allowed the plea to dissolve the marriage under the Hindu Marriage Act. However, the Punjab and Haryana High Court set aside the district judge's order prompting the man (appellant) to file an appeal before the Supreme Court.\nThe appellant contended before the Supreme Court that the High Court made a mistake by overturning the well-founded divorce decree which had concluded that the wife had been cruel by deserting the appellant without an explanation.\nHis wife's counsel countered that a mere long period of separation does not constitute an irretrievable breakdown of the marriage and that she had made all efforts to respect their sacred relationship.\nThe Supreme Court eventually agreed with these submissions, observing that the wife had maintained the sacred relationship since 1963 and had nurtured three children, even when the husband displayed hostility towards them.\nIt, therefore, rejected the the husband's plea to dissolve the marriage and dismissed the appeal.\nAdvocate Vipin Gogia represented appellant-husband.

In response, orders under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) were imposed in various parts of Haryana to restrict the movement of protesting farmers and blocking roads leading to Delhi.\nAll of this led to the filing of two petitions on the issue before the High Court on Monday.\nIn one of the petitions, Uday Pratap Singh, a resident of Panchkula and also an advocate at the High Court, has challenged the restrictions imposed on the protesting farmers, including the sealing of borders and the suspension of the internet. This plea highlighted that the farmers' 'Delhi Chalo' march was a manifestation of their democratic right to protest peacefully.\nThe other plea has sought action against the protesting farmers. This petition, filed by Advocate Arvind Seth, has sought directions to the Union and State governments to take preventive measures to maintain law and order throughout Punjab and Haryana in the wake of the protests.\nThe High Court issued notice in the matter to the Central government and the governments of Punjab, Haryana and Delhi on February 13.\nDuring earlier hearings, the Court had urged for a dialogue between the government and the protesting farmers. \nIn response, the Central government told the Court today that it was open to engaging in a dialogue with the farmers, pursuant to which a meeting with the farmers was scheduled on February 15 (today) at 5 PM.\nThe Punjab government, meanwhile, told the Court that the situation, though tense, was under control.

Therefore, the legislature did not have the competence to legislate the Second Amendment Act.\nIt was thus concluded that once the VAT Act stood repealed, except in the case of limited categories, the question to amend it would not arise.\nIt further held that Section 19 of the Constitution Amendment Act was not a source of power to enable the State legislature to enact the Second Amendment Act, since it was a transitional provision.\nSupreme Court judgment\nThe bench noted that Telangana's amendment act could not have been given effect to post the enactment of the GST regime.\n\"The ordinance’s validity and effect might not have been suspect on the date of its promulgation; yet, the issue is that on the date when it was in fact, approved and given shape as an amendment, the State legislature had ceased to possess the power.

{"ID": "id_188", "Summary": "The Allahabad High Court recently observed that the inability of the State police to deliver summons and carry out court-directed coercive processes to secure the presence of witnesses during a criminal trial violates fundamental rights of an accused including their right to a speedy trial and timely access to bail.

Failure of justice becomes more acute because many of the prisoners belong to marginalized sections of the society and are incapacitated by poverty and legal illiteracy.\"\nThe Court further observed that the proper administration of the right to bail was being hindered due to such lapses by the police. \n\"Inability of the police authorities to serve summons and execute coercive measures issued by the learned trial courts in the specified time frame is an endemic problem and a major bottleneck in the criminal law process. This deficiency in functioning of the police results in absence of witnesses in courts and causes interminable delays in trials and strikes at the root of public faith in the justice delivery system,\" the Court opined.\nSuch non-compliance with court orders would also constitute statutory offences and contempt of court, the judge added. \nHowever, given the large scale of such non-compliances, he observed that initiating contempt proceedings would only lead to multiplicity of court proceedings and drain the scarce resources of the police.\n\"Scale of the problem is so vast that taking out criminal or contempt proceedings in every matter against erring officials would also mire the police and other State departments in excessive and avoidable litigation,\" the Court said.\nTo remedy the problem, the Court proposed tasking particular police officers with the responsibility of ensuring the appearance of witnesses in court at different levels.\nThis approach would only succeed if important police officers are selected for these positions at each level, the Court added.\nThe Court also suggested that such nodal officers should be empowered to coordinate with police forces at various levels, be it District, Zone, State or inter-State.\nThe Court made these observations while granting bail to an accused man, whose trial was found to be moving at a snail's pace on account of the failure of the police to execute processes to secure the presence of witnesses. \nThe judge reiterated the prolonged incarceration of an accused due to delays in trial violates his rights under Article 21 of the Constitution. \nThe Court further opined that the State needs create or review an effective system to hold the police department accountable in such matters.\n\"The police cannot deny its statutory duty to compel prompt appearance of witnesses by timely service of summons and execution of warrants on orders of the courts.

During the interregnum period, the trial has commenced and 19 witnesses have been examined. It is stated that Gaikwad has not violated the terms and conditions of the bail and has not misused his liberty,” the Court said in its order dated January 10. \nPansare was shot at in Kolhapur in February 2015 and succumbed to his injuries few days later. In August this year, the case was transferred to the Anti-Terrorism Squad of Maharashtra with assistance from Crime Investigation Department (CID) Special Investigation Team (SIT).\nThe Maharashtra government moved the Court seeking cancellation of bail on the ground that the earlier two applications by Gaikwad had been rejected on merits by the sessions court at Kolhapur.\nAdditional public prosecutor Prajakta Shinde, who appeared for the State government, argued that the offence was serious and Gaikwad's bail applications was rejected twice before on the ground that eye witness had identified Gaikwad as the assailant.\nLater, the High Court had also rejected the bail application of the accused on July 11, 2016.\nThe accused once again moved the sessions court which granted him bail on June 17, 2017. \nAdvocate Sanjiv Punalekar for Gaikwad pointed out that when the Kolhapur court granted bail in 2017, it was after noting that Pansare’s widow had identified the co-accused as the assailant.\nThe High Court however, said that after it had rejected the bail application of the accused in July 2016, the sessions court could not have entertained the bail application of the accused.\n“Judicial propriety required the Sessions Court not to entertain the subsequent bail application. The course adopted by the learned Sessions Judge in entertaining and granting bail to the Respondent, despite the rejection of his earlier application by this Court on merits, amounts to grave indiscretion which impinges upon judicial discipline and propriety,” the Court recorded in its order.\nHowever, the Court also noted that the material produced by the prosecution prima facie raised doubt about Gaikwad’s involvement in the crime.  \nHence, it said that it was not inclined to cancel the bail.\n“In such circumstances and particularly, in view of the statement of the widow of the deceased, I am not inclined to cancel the bail granted to the respondent Gaikwad.

{"ID": "id_1882", "Summary": "The Madras High Court Monday directed the Tamil Nadu government and the State Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR&CE) Department to ensure non-Hindus are not permitted to enter beyond the flagpole area of the Palani temple (Arulmigu Dhandayuthapaniswamy Temple) and its sub-temples in Tamil Nadu. \nJustice S Srimathy of the Madurai bench said that temples are not picnic spots and Hindus too like other communities have the right to practice their religion without interference. \nThe Court, therefore, directed the State government to “install boards indicating non-Hindus are not allowed” inside the temple premises beyond the flag pole.\nThe judge also ordered that if any non-Hindu wishes to enter the temple, a written undertaking should be obtained from such person that she believes in Hindu religion, its customs and the temple deities.\nThe Court proceeded to issue the following directions:\n“(i)The respondents are directed to install Boards indicating that “Non-Hindus are not allowed inside temple after Kodimaram” in the entrance of the temples, near Kodimaram and at prominent places in the temple. \nii) The respondents are directed not to allow the Non-Hindus who do not believe in Hindu religion. \niii) If any Non-Hindu claims to visit particular deity in the temple, then the respondents shall obtain undertaking from the said Non-Hindu that he is having faith in the deity and he would follow the customs and practices of Hindu religion and also abide by the Temple customs and on such undertaking the said Non-Hindu may be allowed to visit the temple. \niv) Whenever a Non-Hindu is allowed based on the undertaking the same shall be entered in the register which shall be maintained by the temple. \nv) The respondents shall maintain the temple premises by strictly following the agamas, customs and practices of the temple.\nThe Court was hearing a petition filed by D Senthilkumar, organiser of Palani Hill Temple Devotees Organisation, seeking directions from the court for installation of such prohibitory boards and signages.\nIn his plea, Senthilkumar said that in June last year, a Muslim family with several women in \"Burquas,\" had purchased tickets at the winch station to go to the Palani hilltop, the temple’s premises. After the authorities tried stopping them, they argued that there was no board barring the entry of non-Hindus. The family wanted to go to the hilltop to click pictures, Senthilkumar told the Court.\nThe judge refused to accept the State government’s apprehension that installing such boards around the temple and the hilltop where it is situated, might hurt the religious sentiments of visitors, who throng the area not only to visit the sanctum sanctorum of the temple but also to take in the view from the hill top.\nSuch apprehension is misplaced because not prohibiting non-Hindus was likely to hurt the sentiments of the Hindu believers and worshippers.\nHindus too have a right to freely profess and propagate their religion, the judge underscored.\n“If a non-Hindu is not having faith and decline to follow the customs and practices of the Hindu religion and decline to follow the temple customs, then the said non-Hindu cannot be allowed and hence there is no question of hurting his sentiments. On the other hand if the non-Hindu who declines to follow the customs and practices of the Hindu religion and decline to follow the temple customs is allowed inside the temple, it would affect the sentiments of the large number of Hindus who practices the faith as Hindu reverently,\" the Court opined. \nThis would affect the right of Hindus guaranteed under the Constitution of India, the Court said. \nThe respondents are worried about the sentiments of non-Hindu who is not having faith in Hindu religion. By pleading so the respondents are failing to protect the sentiments of the Hindus, the single-judge did not mince her words.\n\"In fact the Hindu Religion & Charitable Endowment Department is mandated to protect the Hindu religion, Hindu temples, its customs and practices, temple customs etc. The respondents are having misplaced sympathy and misplaced worry on sentiments of Non-Hindus,” the Court said.\nThe High Court also said that while the Temple Entry Authorisation Act, 1947 was enacted to eradicate discrimination when it came to permitting entry to temples within the Hindu community, the Act did not deal with temple entry of non-Hindus.\nJustice Srimathy went to say that “temples were purposefully not included within the purview of Article 15.”\n“But the examples cited by the petitioner are real concern for Hindus devotees. Even though the respondent deny the incident cited by the petitioner, there is a newspaper reporting wherein it is stated that group of persons belonging to other religion tried to enter the temple as tourists. It was also reported that in Arulmighu Brahadeeswarar Temple a group of persons belonging to other religion had treated the temple premises as picnic spot and had non vegetarian food inside the temple premises. Likewise recently on 11.01.2024 a newspaper had reported that a group of persons belonging to the other religion had entered the Arulmighu Meenakshi Sundareswarar Temple, Madurai with “their sacred book” near sanctum and sanctorum and was attempting to do their prayers before sanctum sanctorum. These incidents are absolutely interfering in the fundamental rights guaranteed to the Hindus under the constitution. The Hindus also have fundamental right to profess and practice their religion freely and propagate their religion without interfering in their way of practice. Therefore, the Hindus have right to maintain their temples,” the High Court said.\nSenior Counsel N Anantha Padmanabhan and Advocate RM Arun Swaminathan appeared for Senthilkumar, the petitioner.\nAdditional Advocate General Veera Kathiravan, Government Advocate R Ragavendran, and Advocate R Baranidharan appeared for the respondents TN government and the State HR&CE Department.\nAdvocate Abhinav Parthasarathy appeared for the intervenor TS Ramesh."}

Among the conditions listed are disloyalty to the Constitution through acts or speech, associated with an enemy of the State in wartime, and obtaining citizenship by fraud. These grounds may be invoked only if the Central Government deems the person's continuing citizenship as against the public good.\nThe Division Bench noted that the reliance on the section was misconceived given that the revocation under Section 10 applied only to those persons who became citizens by naturalisation or by registration. Kanhaiya Kumar, being a citizen by birth, was not impacted by the Section.\nRebuking Mishra's Counsel for his reliance on Section 10, the Bench commented:\nAdding that the charges slapped against Kumar for his \"inflammatory\" speeches in Delhi did not warrant the revocation of his citizenship, the Court refused to discuss the merits of the said speeches.\nThe Court dismissed the petition, imposing an amount of Rs 25,000 as costs to be deposited with the High Court Registry.\nRecording its disapproval of the petition, the Bench stated that the proceedings were 'frivolous', and 'an abuse of court time.'\nRead the Order here:"}

It cannot be said to be a condition of attending or continuing to attend the entertainment (horse race) because such a condition is not uniformly applicable to all the persons entering the race course. In our view, unless such a condition is uniformly applicable to all persons entering the race course and is payable mandatorily and paid by all, irrespective of whether he carried a mobile phone or not, the same cannot be said to be 'payment for admission' as defined in the Bombay Entertainments Duty Act. Therefore, to the extent of the amounts paid for carrying the mobile phone into the races, it cannot be made subject to the payment of entertainment tax at the rates prescribed under the said Act,\" the bench said in its July 1 order.\nThe bench was seized of the petition filed by the club challenging the decision of the Maharashtra government, which by a Government Resolution (GR) issued in December 2001, decided that the charges collected for carrying a mobile phone into the race course during a race are to be treated as payment for admission as defined in Section 2 (b)(iv) of the said Act. Hence, it was decided to levy entertainment duty on same in accordance with the provisions of the Act.\nThe club through senior counsel Shyam Mehta argued that carrying of mobile phones during races does not amount to entertainment nor is it connected with an entertainment, for the purposes of the said Act. \nThe charges levied do not fulfill the definitional parameters of “payment for admission.\" \nHence, the charging section i.e Section 3 of the said Act, which levies a duty on payments for admission should not be attracted in the present case.\nThe judges noted the definition of entertainment from the act and said a payment to be taxable must be a necessary condition to be complied with for gaining entry into the place of entertainment, which is the race course in the present case.\n\"The term ‘entertainment’ as per definition includes any exhibition, performance, amusement, game or sport to which persons are admitted on payment. None of these elements exist when a person takes his mobile phone into the race course. There is no exhibition or amusement or game or sport enjoyed by a person taking his mobile phone into the race course. The amount charged by petitioner from every person is not for admission to the race course itself but for carrying the mobile phone during the races. Such a payment cannot be termed as payment for any purposes whatsoever 'connected with an entertainment' which a person is required to make as a condition of attending or continuing to attend the entertainment,\" the Court said.\nIt further stated that the state authorities would have been justified to levy such a duty if the club charged this extra fees from each and every person entering the race course irrespective of whether he/she took their mobile phones along with them.\n\"On the facts of the case, it is obvious that it is not compulsory for anyone wanting to enter in the race course to carry the mobile phone inside. If he does not carry the mobile phone, he does not have to pay. If he wants to carry the mobile phone, he will have to pay. It has nothing to do with entertainment for which he is said to be paying,\" the Court noted.\nTherefore, the Court allowed the petition filed by the club and directed the State authorities to refund the amount deposited by the club under the said duty.\nSenior Advocate Shyam Mehta along with advocates Vivek Shiralkar, Yashoda Desai and law firm Shiralkar & Co. appeared for the club.\nAdditional Government Pleader Himanshu Takke, represented the state authorities."}

In these circumstances, the Scrutiny Committee ought to have appreciated the evidence produced on record by the Petitioner which pertains to the relatives of the mother of the Petitioner but that has not been done by the Scrutiny Committee,\" it said.\nTherefore, the Court held the committee's order to be unsustainable.

That way, the natural premise that would follow, would proceed on theme that the actual site of the Shivlingam would remain preserved and protected,\" the High Court said. \nThe technical and scientific report of the ASI has opened ways for carrying out scientific investigation of the Shivlinga without causing any damage to the structure in question, the Court added.\nTaking into consideration the report submitted by the ASI and arguments made by parties, the Bench set aside Varanasi District Court's order of October, 2022 which had rejected a the plea filed by by Hindu parties seeking directions to the ASI to conduct a scientific investigation.\nIt, therefore, directed the District Judge, Varanasi to proceed in the case and do scientific investigation of the Shivlinga under aegis and guidance of the ASI.\nThe Court was hearing a revision plea was filed by Hindu side against the Varanasi District Court order of October 2022.\nThe Hindu parties had moved the Court contending that the object discovered at the site after survey by an advocate commissioner is a Shiva Linga which is an object of worship for Hindu devotees and has been existing within the premises in question since time immemorial.\nIn light of this, it was argued that with the aim to do complete justice and to provide a remedy to a large number of Lord Shiva worshippers, it is necessary that the Court direct the ASI to find the nature and age of the same.\nThe case itself began when Hindu devotees approached a civil court seeking the right to worship inside Gyanvapi Mosque, claiming that it was a Hindu temple and still houses Hindu deities.\nThe civil court ordered a survey of the Mosque by an advocate commissioner, who then videotaped the premises and submitted a report to the civil court. The report, among other things, stated that an object similar in appearance to a Shivling was found.\nThe matter was later transferred to the District Court, Varanasi on orders passed by the Supreme Court.\nOn October 14 last year, the District Court passed an order rejecting a plea for scientific investigation to ascertain whether the object was a Shivling or a fountain, as claimed by the respondents.\nThe order of the District Court was challenged before the High Court on the ground that it wrongly presumed that a scientific investigation in the form of carbon dating or use of a ground penetrating radar would harm or damage the object.\nThe petitioner added that there was no prayer in the application for scientific investigation that would be harmful, and further stated that ASI has sufficient means to investigate the object without damaging it.\nThe Counsel for ASI submitted that, the methods which can help in carrying out scientific investigation/survey of the site without damaging it should be adhered and the scientific analysis should carried out so that actual age of the Shivlinga may be ascertained.\nThe counsel for respondent raised a preliminary objection regarding the proceeding of the Court in view of the Supreme Court's May 17, 2022 order directing that the object has to be protected/preserved\nTherefore, it was submitted that it cannot be disturbed and any order passed for carrying out a survey or scientific investigation of the site would be violative of the aforesaid order.\nThe Bench set aside the Varanasi court order. \nIt said, \n\"If the trial Judge had any apprehension of damage being caused to the site in case scientific investigation of the site is directed in that event it was obligatory on his part to have sought expert opinion of the persons well versed in carrying out such type of enterprises like the present one.

He attributed the blame to diminished participation of students in social causes after liberalisation, and continued to emphasise that student participation in modern democracies was essential.\n\"Any keen observer of the Indian society would notice that in the past few decades no big leader has emerged from the student community. This appears to be correlated with the diminished participation of students in social causes after liberalisation. Importance of student participation in modern democracy cannot be played down,\" he said.\nHence, he called upon students to enter public life and emerge as leaders. \n“It is necessary for you to take part in current debates. You must have a clear vision. It is essential that more and more well-meaning, forward-looking, and upright students like you enter public life. You must emerge as leaders. After all, political consciousness and well-informed debates can steer the nation into a glorious future as envisioned by our Constitution.\nThe Chief Justice was speaking at the 8th Convocation of the National Law University, Delhi.\nThe CJI began his speech by congratulating the new graduates and shared a quote by Justice MC Chagla speaking to the nature and nobility of the legal profession.\n“The legal profession is a great calling and it is a learned and noble profession. Remember always that it is a profession. It is not a trade or business. The distinction between the two is deep and fundamental. In business, your sole object is to make money. In the legal profession making money is merely incidental.”\nThe CJI took note of the fact that students are an integral part of society and thus, cannot live in isolation. He reminded the audience that when the youth becomes socially and politically conscious, basic issues come into national discourse.\nIn continuation of this thought, he lamented on the current culture of education in court, stating that the focus lately was greater on professional courses with a total neglect of equally important subjects such as humanities and natural sciences.\n“In an anxiety to secure highly remunerative and profitable job opportunities, children are sent to exile in privately run residential schools and coaching centres. The formative years of budding talents are spent in a suffocating atmosphere which unfortunately resembles prisons,” he said.\nSpeaking on the growing popularity of National Law Universities, Chief Justice Ramana pointed out that most students from these universities end up working at corporate law firms, explaining that this is probably the reason NLUs are viewed as elitist.\n“Even though such law firms are an integral part of the legal landscape of the country, it is unfortunate that a comparable addition is not being made to the ranks of lawyers practicing in Courts from the National Law Universities. This is perhaps one of the reasons why National Law Universities are perceived as elitist and detached from social realities,” he said.\nThe CJI encouraged young graduates to explore legal practice and explained that it would give them an opportunity to spend their time and efforts on causes they are passionate about and fight battles in Court relating to various social issues.\n“You must reflect on the role you can play in the social enrichment and transformation of the nation. Only such introspection leads to development of necessary strength of character and conviction of belief,” the CJI said.\nThe Chief Justice ended his speech by reminding the lawyers in the audience to always uphold the Constitution, and as officers of the Court guard the institution during testing times."}

The prosecutrix is forced to be present in Court with the accused, who is the same person who has allegedly violated her. It was felt that it would be in the interest of the victim that she is not traumatized again and again by re-living the said incident by being present in Court proceedings,” the Court said.\nThe judge, after taking into consideration the suggestions from the advocate Adit S Pujari, Delhi High Court Legal Services Committee (DHCLSC) and Delhi State Legal Services Authority (DSLSA) issued the following guidelines:\nThe investigating officer (IO) shall ensure timely service of notice of bail application on the victim/ prosecutrix, so that she gets reasonable amount of time to enter appearance and make her submissions;\nThe IO, while serving notice/summons shall make relevant inquiries about the victim and her circumstances and shall document the same in order to assist the court in the hearing of the bail application and to facilitate effective representation and participation on behalf of the victim. The IO should ensure that while making such enquiries the victim is not made to feel uncomfortable or questioned like an accomplice to a crime;\nThe victim can be produced virtually before the Court (either by the IO/ Support person before the Court) (by way of Video Conferencing) or by taking assistance of the DLSA District Legal Services. Victim and the accused shall not come face to face in this manner and this can prevent the re-traumatization of the victim;\nIf the victim gives it in writing that her counsel/ parent/guardian/ support person shall appear on her behalf and make submissions on the bail application, insistence on physical or virtual presence of the prosecutrix should not be made. A written authorization of the victim authorising another to make submissions on her behalf (after victim is duly indentified by the IO) and said authorization is forwarded by the SHO, should suffice.\nIf the victim has appeared in court on one date of hearing of a bail application, her presence on subsequent dates can be dispensed with.\nIn certain exceptional cases, in- chamber interaction with the victim can be done and her submissions qua the bail application can be recorded in the order sheet passed on that day, so that the same maybe considered at a later stage.\nWhile recording the submissions/ objections/ statement of the victim qua the bail application, appropriate questions may be put to the victim to elicit her responses instead of bluntly asking her “Do you want bail to be given to the accused or not?” Rather questions can be put to her to ascertain what her apprehensions and fears are in case the accused is granted bail in the matter, for bail is to be granted by the Court concerned based on overall appreciation of facts and circumstances of the case and in the light of well settled principles governing the grant of bail.\nWhenever the victim comes to court for a hearing on the bail application, the support person provided to her should be present with her so as to provide the necessary psychological or logistical support to the victim/prosecutrix.\nVictim's presence may not be insisted on in cases under POCSO Act, where the accused is a child in conflict with law, because the considerations for grant of bail to the child in conflict with law are not dependent on the apprehensions of the prosecutrix.\nAfter the bail application is disposed of, the copy of the order should be mandatorily sent to the victim. This becomes important since the victim's main concern is her safety in case the accused is enlarged on bail. By providing her a copy of the bail order the victim is made aware about the status of the accused and the conditions of the bail and her right to approach the court for cancellation of bail in case of breach of conditions of bail.\nJudicial Officers should be sensitized about the need to reduce interface of victim with the accused in court to the minimum possible and to permit victim to be represented through an authorised person in court at the time of hearing of bail application.\nJustice Singh directed the Secretary (Litigation) DSLSA to the circulate the order to all the necessary parties and stakeholders. \nAdvocates Adit S Pujari and Aparajita Sinha represented the appellant in the case. \nState was represented through Additional Public Prosecutor (APP) Manjeet Arya\nAdvocate Astha appeared for the prosecutrix. \nSecretary (Litigation) DSLSA, Harshita Mishra also joined the proceedings."}

{"ID": "id_204", "Summary": "The Supreme Court last week pulled up the Madhya Pradesh government for filing an appeal before it after a delay of 663 days.\nWhile dismissing this matter on grounds of limitation, the Court went on to impose costs of Rs 25,000 on the State for wasting judicial time.\nThe scathing order passed by a Bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Dinesh Maheshwari reads,\nThe message sent out by the Court was, however, not restricted to the Madhya Pradesh government, but was for all government counsel.\n\"No doubt, some leeway is given for the Government inefficiencies but the sad part is that the authorities keep on relying on judicial pronouncements for a period of time when technology had not advanced and a greater leeway was given to the Government.\"\nIn the instant case, the reason for delay cited by the Madhya Pradesh government was \"unavailability of the documents and the process of arranging for documents\". The \"inadvertent delay\" had also been passed off as a result of \"bureaucratic process works\", the Court records.\nThe Court opined that a larger message must be sent out to counter the cavalier manner in which government appeals are filed. The order states,\n\"A preposterous proposition is sought to be propounded that if there is some merit in the case, the period of delay is to be given a go-by. If a case is good on merits, it will succeed in any case. It is really a bar of limitation which can even shut out good cases.\"\nIt was further noted that this practice is adopted in what the Court has described as \"certificate cases\", that is when an appeal is filed to obtain a certificate of dismissal from the Supreme Court to put a quietus to the issue.\nThe Bench went on to note that despite deprecating this practice on earlier occasions,\n\"There seems to be no improvement. The purpose of coming to this Court is notto obtain such certificates and if the Government suffers losses, it is time when the concerned officer responsible for the same bears the consequences. The irony is that in none of the cases any action is taken against the officers, who sit on the files and do nothing. It is presumed that this Court will condone the delay and even in making submissions, straight away counsels appear to address on merits without referring even to the aspect of limitation as happened in this case till we pointed out to the counsel that he must first address us on the question of limitation.\"\nIn order to send out a message to government authorities that they must pay for wastage of judicial time, the Court found it appropriate to impose costs of Rs 25,000 on the State.\nThe costs, the Court said, must be recovered from the concerned officials whose inaction caused the delay in filing the SLP. A certificate of recovery of this amount is required to be filed before the Court within four weeks.\nThe Court also made it clear that a failure to deposit the costs with the Mediation and Conciliation Project Committee and a submission of the certificate of recovery would lead to initiation of contempt proceedings against the Chief Secretary of the State.\nRead Order:\nSupreme Court cannot be a place for governments to walk in when they choose, ignoring limitation period: Apex Court pulls up MP govt | https://t.co/xCaY5xp7f8"}

{"ID": "id_208", "Summary": "The Madras High Court on Monday refused to entertain a petition challenging the decision of the Central government to trade 5 percent of its shareholding in Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) through Initial Public Offering (IPO) [L Ponnammal v Union of India].\nThe petitioner L Ponnammal had challenged the provisions of the Finance Act, 2021 (2021 Act) and Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) Act, 1956 for being ultra vires Article 110 of the Constitution of India for enactment of the amendments by way of the 2021 Act as money bill. \nChief Justice Munishwar Nath Bhandari and Justice D Bharatha Chakravarthy while dismissing the petition for being devoid of merits advised against inference into the implementation of a public interest policy by way of legislation reasoning that, “it directly impacts the economic growth of the country and interference therein may have far reaching consequences, because the receipt of money into the Consolidated Fund of India is to be used for the development of the country.”\n- The petition challenged the two acts on the ground that the subject-matter would not fall within the definition of \"Money Bills\";\n- The respondent opposed the plea on the ground that amendment was with a purpose to receive money in the Consolidated Fund of India thus, was not violative of Article 110;\n- The Court that since the purpose was to receive the money into the Consolidated Fund, it fell within the purview of Article 110;\n- Further, precedent was relied on to conclude that Money Bill cannot be construed in a restrictive sense;\n- Thus, finding no constitutional illegality, the petition was dismissed.\nThe petitioner, a policyholder of the LIC, challenged the provisions on the ground that they were introduced by way of a Money Bill under Article 110 of the Constitution of India, even though the amendment did not fall in the category of Money Bill.\nThe amendment of 2021 was classified by the Speaker of the Lok Sabha under Article 110 of the Constitution as a Money Bill. A certificate for the same was issued by the Speaker even though the Finance Bill contained matters other than those specified in sub-clauses (a) to (f) of clause (1) of Article 110 of the Constitution of India.\nThe petitioner’s challenge was essentially on the ground that the amendments would result in a reduction in the share of surplus allocated to participating policyholders.\nThe petitioner emphasised that a bill was a Money Bill if it \"only\" contained provisions dealing with all or any of the subject-matters given therein. Thus, the certificate was wrongly issued.\nThe respondent, on the other hand, submitted that the decision of the Central government was approved by the parliament to trade 5% of its shareholding in LIC through IPO, thus the amendment was valid and there was no constitutional bar in bringing an IPO.\nIn fact, it was stated that the purpose of amendment was to receive money in the Consolidated Fund of India to be used for the development of the country which is why the Finance Act fell within the realm of Article 110 of the Constitution of India.\nFurther, the government submitted that the process and procedure for certifying the Finance Bill as a Money Bill was complied with and, therefore, there was no constitutional illegality.\nThe Court, elaborated at length, the legislative developments, amendments to provisions of the LIC Act and the executive developments.\nTo discuss the scope of the money bill, the Court relied on the judgment of the Supreme Court in Justice KS Puttaswamy (Retd) v. Union Of India and Rojer Mathew v. South Indian Bank Limited , both of which held that the expression \"Money Bill\" could not be construed in a restrictive sense and that the wisdom of the Speaker of the Lok Sabha must be valued, except where it was blatantly violative of the Constitutional scheme.\nFurther, testing the constitutional validity of the case independent of these judgments the Court took note of the fact that the amendment was brought in to allow the Central government to float the IPO and receive money into the Consolidated Fund of India. \nThus, it was concluded that the amendments were saved by Article 110(1)(g) because payment of money into the Consolidated Fund or the Contingency Fund of India was covered by Article 110(1)(c) of the Constitution.\n“We are, therefore, of the view that the amendment in the case on hand falls within the purview of Article 110 of the Constitution of India.”\nThe Bench also said that a bare reading of provision made it clear that on the issue of whether a Bill was a Money Bill or not, the decision of the speaker was final. However, the petitioner had not challenged the decision of the speaker.\n“In the absence of challenge to the decision of the Speaker of the House of the People, it became final in view of Article 110(3) of the Constitution of India and if challenge to the amendment is accepted, then we would be going against the mandate of Article 110(3) of the Constitution of India with a challenge to the certification by the Speaker of the House of the People,” the High Court opined.\nTherefore, taking note that the process for certifying the Finance Bill as a Money Bill was duly complied with and it was not a case where allegation of constitutional fraud was made, the petition was dismissed.\nAdvocates Abhishek Jebaraj and SG Arul Mozhi Selvan appeared for the petitioner while the Respondents were represented by Additional Solicitor General N Venkataraman, Senior Advocate Satish Parasaran and advocates Prasad Vijayakumar and B Deepak Narayanan."}

The channel named it 'Operation Paap' and ran a show under the heading 'Sarji ka vidhayak Gangster ka Sahayak'.\nThe audio clip was run on the programme alleging that Balyan was talking to Sangwan and planning extortion.\nThe Court held that the channel did not verify facts/allegations from Balyan and the clip was broadcast without observing the duties attached with the freedom enshrined under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution.\nSangwan approached the trial court on August 17 the same day that the channel telecast news against him.\nOn that day, the court restrained the channel from further broadcasting of the clip. It issued summons on the suit and listed the case for further consideration the next day. When the case was taken up next, the order was extended to August 23.\nTimes Now Navbharat then moved the Delhi High Court against the order.\nIn a judgement pronounced on August 25, the High Court rejected the channel’s plea and asked them to approach the trial. The High Court asked the trial court to decide the matter within a week if the channel filed its reply before August 28.\nThe trial court then heard the matter on interim relief and held on September 6 that the channel not only broadcast the audio clip but even held a debate whose participants were neither the associates of the alleged gangster nor were they the agency investigating the crime to give their opinion on a national forum without verifying the facts.\n\"The defendant itself mentioned in the WS [written statement] that the matter is under investigation with the police of Special Cell against Mr. Sachin Sangwan @ gangster Nandu.

{"ID": "id_21", "Summary": "The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld a Gauhati High Court decision to set aside a rule enabling Deputy Commissioners (DCs) in Assam to initiate performance and appraisal reports of Indian Police Service officers in the State who are posted as Superintendents of Police (SPs) [State of Assam and ors vs Binod Kumar and ors].\nDeputy or District Commissioners of Assam is a civil service post equivalent to Collectors/Magistrates in districts of other States.\nA bench of Justices Aniruddha Bose and PV Sanjay Kumar stated that the performance of a district Superintendent of Police (SP) cannot be reviewed by a DC since the latter is not hierarchically above the former. \n\"When liberty has been given to the SP to disagree with the Deputy Commissioner on any point relating to police administration and seek resolution of such difference of opinion through the Commissioner and, thereafter, the Inspector General of Police, it would be a parody to subject the performance assessment of such a SP to the same Deputy Commissioner with whom he/she had disagreed,\" the bench explained.\nThe Annual Confidential Reports (ACRs) and Annual Performance Appraisal Reports (APARs) produced by DCs in such situations cannot be taken as being impartial and objective, the top court added. \n\"Such a situation must necessarily be avoided to maintain the sanctity of the assessment process. This constitutes one more reason why the Deputy Commissioner should not be the ‘Reporting Authority’ of the SP of that district.\"\nThe observations while disposing of an appeal filed by the Assam government against a Gauhati High Court order. \nThe case concerned who the ‘Reporting Authority’ to initiate ACRs and APARs of SPs in Assam should be.\nIn particular, the question was whether Rule 63(iii) of the Assam Police Manual, which prescribes that such assessment should be initiated by the Deputy Commissioner, was lawful. \nThe rule had been challenged before the High Court by various SPs in Assam. The High Court ruled in their favour by holding that the rule in question was violative of Section 14(2) of the Assam Police Act, 2007.\nThe High Court ruling was then challenged by the Assam government before the Supreme Court. \nThe top court issued notice on this appeal in January 2019 and later sought the assistance of the Attorney General for India R Venkataramani in March last year.\n While deciding on the appeal, the top court took exception to arguments by the State of Assam that the IPS officers who had moved the High Court could not insist on a reviewer of their choice.\nThe Court underscored that IPS Officers, being members of an All-India Service, would be amenable to the rules framed under the 2007 Act. Therefore, allowing DCs to interfere with the internal organisation of the police force would be contrary to the mandate of this Act, the Court said.\n\"Merely because they are deployed/deputed to work in the State of Assam, IPS Officers cannot be denied the benefit of the 2007 Rules which would be applicable across the board to their ilk serving all over the country. It would, therefore, be incorrect to castigate such IPS Officers as insisting upon a ‘Reporting Authority’ of their choice. They are merely seeking parity with their kind working in other parts of the country,\" the Court added. \nThe Assam government's appeal was, thus dismissed. The 2017 Gauhati High Court ruling was confirmed.\nAdditional Advocate General Nalin Kohli, Senior Advocate R Balasubramanian, with advocates Shuvodeep Roy, Nimisha Menon, Sarthak Sharma, and Ayushman Arora appeared for the Assam government.\nSenior Advocates Aman Lekhi and L Narasimha Reddy with advocates Somanadri Goud Katam, Ujjwal Sinha, Vijay Pal, Namrata Trivedi, Sirajuddin, Aniket Seth, Snehil Sonam, and Ritwiz Rishabh represented the original petitioners (IPS officers)."}
{"ID": "id_210", "Summary": "The Karnataka High Court on Tuesday refused to quash a criminal complaint against a lawyer accused of raping one of his interns. [Rajesh KSN v. State of Karnataka and Anr]\nJustice M Nagaprasanna observed that any interference by the Court would render plaudits to the wanton lust and vicious appetite of the petitioner (accused lawyer). \n\"If a naive student of law, enters the office of an Advocate, as an intern; in turn gets to face these horrendous acts, it would have a chilling effect on the entire practice and profession,\" the Court added.\nThe Court was hearing a petition by the lawyer to quash certain charges against him.\nAccording to the complaint, the law student joined the petitioner's office as an intern in August 2021. One evening, when the two were the only people present in the office, the lawyer allegedly called the student to his cabin and attempted to rape her.\nThe complainant-student also claimed that she had recorded a call in which the petitioner admitted to the rape attempt.\nAccordingly, a complaint was registered for rape and allied offences under the Indian Penal Code (IPC).\nThe petitioner admitted his guilt under Sections 354A (sexual harassment), 354B (assault or use of criminal force to woman with intent to disrobe), 354C (voyeurism), and 354D (punishment for stalking) of the IPC but contended that there was no prima facie evidence for the rest of the charges. \nHe argued that the chargesheet did not indicate the commission of rape and that even the complaint did not indicate it. \nHe also underscored that the complainant had, during her medical examination, informed the doctor that there was no sexual intercourse.\nSection 376(2)(f) imposes punishment on a person who, in the capacity of a relative, guardian, teacher, or someone in a position of trust or authority towards a woman, commits rape against her. \nSimilarly, Section 376(2)(k) penalizes an individual who, through a position of control or dominance over a woman, commits rape against her. \nFurthermore, Section 376C(a) establishes the liability of a person for rape if they engage in such an act while holding a position of authority or being in a fiduciary relationship.\nThe Court observed that the petitioner fulfilled all of these roles as he held the positions of a teacher and a person in a position of trust. Additionally, he was in a position of control or dominance over the complainant and held a position of authority.\nOn the contention that there was only an attempt to rape and no commission as such, the Court observed that this was a disputed question of fact and would require a trial. \nThe Court further observed that the complainant's statement to the doctor was an extra-judicial one and whether or not rape was committed was a matter of evidence.\nThe Court also pointed out that it could not delve deep into the facts in the exercise of its jurisdiction under Section 482 (saving of inherent powers of the High Court) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC).\nThe judge went on to note that the trial court was yet to frame charges and there was no reason to believe that it would not apply its mind.\nAccordingly, the Court determined that its interference was not warranted, and dismissed the plea.\nThe petitioner was represented by Advocate Parameshwar N Hegde.\nThe State was represented by High Court Government Pleader (HCGP) KP Yashodha.\nThe complainant was represented by Advocate Sophia."}

State of Karnataka and Anr]\nThe allegation against Mayawati was that she had prevented Election Commission officials from checking currency bundles allegedly in her possession and had snatched the same from them when they tried to count it.\nSingle-judge Justice S Sunil Dutt Yadav said that the same will not amount to an offence under Sections 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) under the Indian Penal Code (IPC). \n\"In the facts of this case, what needs to be noted is though there is an assertion that the complainant was prevented from counting the currency notes, the only assertion in the complaint is that the currency note bundle was not permitted to be counted and was snatched away from the hands of the Official. That by itself which is the version of the complainant would not be sufficient even if accepted as amounting to criminal force as envisaged under Section 353 of IPC,\" the Court said. \nBesides Section 353, the BSP leaders had also been charged for offences under Sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) read with Section 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). \nThe complaint was registered when Election Commission officials were checking the amount of money in Mayawati's possession during her campaign for the 2013 assembly elections in Karnataka.\nIt was alleged that while the officials were checking her handbag, she did not allow them to count the money in her possession and 'snatched' the notes back. As the process was not completed, the officers had to repeat the checking again. \nWhen Mayawati explained that only ₹50,000 out of the ₹1,00,000 found in her possession belonged to her, and the remaining amount belonged to the General Secretary of the party, the cash was not seized by the checking team. \nThe Court noted that for a complaint of an offence under Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), Section 195 (prosecution for contempt of lawful authority of public servants) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) clearly requires the complaint to be filed in terms of Section 200 (examination of complainant) of the CrPC, which had not been fulfilled in the present case. \nRegarding Section 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) of the IPC, the Court noted that the complaint only asserted that the currency note bundle was not permitted to be counted and was \"snatched away\" from the hands of the official. \nBy itself, this does not amount to criminal force, held the Court. \nFurther, the explanation of the petitioner that only ₹50,000 out of the ₹1,00,000 belonged to her was accepted, and there was no seizure of cash by the checking team. Thus, the process of questioning regarding the amount had been completed. Since the explanation had been accepted by the Election Commission of India, the continuance of the proceedings would not secure the end of justice, the Court said, while allowing the petition and quashing the criminal proceedings. \nSenior Advocate Pramila Nesargi with advocate C Jagadish represented the petitioners. \nHigh Court Government Pleader S Vishwa Murthy appeared for the State."}

{"ID": "id_216", "Summary": "The Bombay High Court earlier this month observed that driving at high speed alone will not attract the offence of rash and negligent driving [State of Maharashtra v.

Rashness implies the speed which is unwarranted. Whereas act of the negligence involves not taking proper care and attention while driving,” the Court observed. \nThe Court, therefore, upheld the acquittal of a man who was booked for causing the death of a cyclist and a bullock after the car he was driving had hit them. \nThe man was charged for offences under Sections 279 (rash and negligent driving), 337 (hurt due to rash and negligent act), 338 (grievous hurt due to rash and negligent act) and 304A (causing death by negligence) of the Indian Penal Code and Section 134 of the Motor Vehicles Act. \nDuring the trial, five witnesses were examined, documentary evidence was produced. The prosecution case was that the car of the accused was being driven at a high speed. \nThe trial court, however, acquitted the accused in 2009 which was challenged by the State of Maharashtra before the Bombay High Court.\nThe High Court opined that speed alone cannot be a determinative factor to conclude that the driver was driving the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner.\n“No doubt he said that Tata sumo came speedily. It has to be appreciated on the basis of other available materials,” the Court observed. \nFrom the evidence submitted, the High Court also could not decipher the direction in which the car and the bullock cart were moving to determine how they crashed into each other.\n“It is really strange state of affairs, when such matters are conducted neither Investigating Officer has prepared a map/rough sketch, nor trial court has taken pains in recording directions correctly in the evidence. If there is some confusion, the trial Court could have clarified it from the witnesses by putting questions which is permissible by law,” the Court observed. \nIt also said that there was no evidence to corroborate the statements of the bullock cart driver. \n“It is true that the consequence of the accident are the death of the one bullock and the bicycle driver. For want of evidence, the trial court could not come to the conclusion about rash and negligent driving by the respondent.

However, the personal liberty of an accused cannot be sacrificed on the altar of preventive detention merely because a person is implicated in a criminal proceeding,\" the Court observed.\nThe bench was hearing an appeal challenging a decision of the Telangana High Court which had dismissed a Habeas Corpus petition moved by the appellant challenging his order of detention under Section 3(2) of the Telangana Prevention of Dangerous Activities Act 1986 (Telangana Act).\nBackground\nTwo First Information Reports (FIRs) were registered against the appellant under Sections 408, 420, 506 and 120B of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). \nAn order of detention was passed against the appellant (detenu) on May 19, 2021 which noted that the appellant-detenu was detained since he is a ‘white-collar offender’ under Section 2(x) of the Telangana Act of 1986 whose offence of cheating gullible job aspirants had been causing 'large scale fear and panic among the gullible unemployed job aspirants/you.\nHe was thus, detained on the ground that he was acting in a manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order apart from disturbing the peace, tranquility and social harmony in the society'.\nThe detention order also noted that the appellant had been granted conditional bail under the two FIRs.\nSupreme Court judgment\nThe apex court noted that the order of detention was evidently based on stale material and demonstrated non-application of mind on the part of the detaining authority. The Bench noted that the detention order was passed nearly seven months after the registration of the first FIR and about five months after the registration of the second FIR.\nIn this backdrop, the Court observed that:\n\"A mere apprehension of a breach of law and order is not sufficient to meet the standard of adversely affecting the 'maintenance of public order'. In this case, the apprehension of a disturbance to public order owing to a crime that was reported over seven months prior to the detention order has no basis in fact. The apprehension of an adverse impact to public order is a mere surmise of the detaining authority, especially when there have been no reports of unrest since the detenu was released on bail.\"\nMoreover, the Bench was of the view that the two FIRs which were registered against the appellant-detenu are capable of being dealt by the ordinary course of criminal law instead of exercising the exceptional powers of preventive detention.\nIn view of the above, the Court quashed and set aside the order of detention of the appellant.\nSenior Advocate A Sirajudeen argued for the appellant.\nAdvocate Mohith Rao argued for the respondents."}
{"ID": "id_219", "Summary": "A B.Tech student at IIT Guwahati accused of having committed rape on a fellow student, was recently granted bail by the Gauhati High Court despite the Court noting that there was a clear prima facie case against the accused (Utsav Kadam vs. State of Assam).\nJustice Ajit Borthakur reasoned that the accused is a talented, young student and a future asset to the State while also stating that he is unlikely to influence witnesses or tamper with evidence.\n\"On hearing the counsel for both sides with reference to the relevant documents such as FIR, medical report and statements under Sections 161 and 164 CrPC, the contents of the charge-sheet, the Fact-Finding Committee report etc., there is a clear prima facie case as alleged against the accused petitioner,\" the Court observed.\nHowever, as the investigation in the case is complete and both the informant/victim girl and the accused are the State’s future assets being talented students pursuing technical courses at the IIT Guwahati, and are young in the age group of 19 to 21 years and hail from two different States, continued detention of the accused may not be necessary, the Court held. \n\"A perusal of the list of witnesses too, cited in the charge-sheet, this Court finds no possibility of the accused tampering with their evidence or influencing them directly or indirectly, if released on bail,\" the Court added while granting bail to the accused.\nAs per the first information report (FIR), on the evening of March 28, the accused lured the victim to the premises of Aksara School under the garb of discussing her responsibility as the Joint Secretary of the Finance and Economic Club of the college. Following this, he forcibly administered alcohol to her and raped her after she fell unconscious. \nSenior Advocate KN Choudhury appearing for the accused, argued that since the investigation was already complete, there was no scope for the accused to jump the course of justice.\nIt was further contended that continuation of his detention for the purpose of trial would amount to causing further damage to his brilliant academic pursuits.\nOn the other hand, both Additional Public Prosecutor D Das and Advocate S Sarma, appearing for the victim vehemently opposed the bail application.\nDas asserted that there was a clear case in favour of the victim and enlarging the accused on bail would certainly hamper the trial and cause gross injustice to the victim.\nThe counsel for the victim stated that the offence was serious in nature and one that was against society as a whole.\nHowever, on consideration of the facts and circumstances, the Court did not find the detention of the accused necessary observing that there was no possibility for the accused to tamper with the evidence or influence witnesses directly or indirectly.\nThus, Justice Ajit Borthakur allowed the bail application while imposing the following conditions:\n“i) That the accused/petitioner shall continue to appear before the learned trial Court, on all dates to be fixed from time to time, till the case is disposed of;\nii) That the accused/petitioner shall not directly or indirectly make any inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of the case so as to dissuade him from disclosing such facts to the Police Officer or the Court.; and\niii) That the accused/petitioner shall not leave the territorial jurisdiction of the Court of learned Sessions Judge, Kamrup at Amingaon without prior written permission of the learned Sessions Judge, Kamrup at Amingaon.”"}
{"ID": "id_22", "Summary": "The Supreme Court on Thursday quashed the sedition case registered by the Himachal Pradesh Police against journalist Vinod Dua him in connection with his video uploaded on YouTube last year criticising the Central government's implementation of the Covid-19 lockdown.\nThe verdict was delivered by a Bench of Justices UU Lalit and Vineet Saran. \n\"Every Journalist will be entitled to protection in terms of Kedar Nath Singh, as every prosecution under Sections 124A and 505 of the IPC must be in strict conformity with the scope and ambit of said Sections as explained in, and completely in tune with the law laid down in Kedar Nath Singh,\" the Court ordered. \nThe Court, however, rejected a prayer by Dua to direct that no FIR should be registered against any media personnel with 10 years experience unless cleared by an expert committee.\n\"We have rejected the committee formation prayer since it will be directly encroaching upon the legislative domain. However, the FIR against Vinod Dua stands quashed,\" the Court said. \nIn June 2020, the apex court had issued interim directions to protect Dua from arrest in the matter, although the Bench declined to stay the FIR filed in Himachal Pradesh by a BJP leader.\nDua was accused of having made certain statements on his YouTube program, 'Vinod Dua show'. \nThe statements in the episode streamed on March 30, 2020 were capable of inciting communal hatred and led to breach of peace and communal disharmony, it was alleged. \nFirst Information Report was registered against him based on a complaint filed by BJP leader Ajay Shyam in this regard. \nHe was charged with grave offences under the IPC including sedition (Section 124A), public nuisance (Section 268), printing defamatory matter (Section 501) and intent to cause public mischief (Section 505). \nDua submitted in his petition before the Supreme Court that the video in question critically analysed the failures of the Government of India regarding the declaration of nationwide lockdown and the manner in which the same was implemented.\n“The Petitioner also made a reference to the politicization of the army’s attack in response to the Pulwama Attack and usage of the same in the last elections. There was nothing in the video which could be remotely termed to be criminal,” Dua stated in his petition.\nSenior Advocate Vikas Singh, arguing for Dua, had submitted that the allegation that Dua's show had caused the migrant labour exodus amid the COVID-19 lockdown was only an afterthought and it was not part of the complaint to begin with.\n\"The said argument has been made only to somehow justify the FIR,\" he said. \nAdditional Solicitor General SV Raju, appearing for government authorities, submitted that even if one cognisable offence is made out, the FIR cannot be quashed. \nHe further added that offences under Sections 153 and 188 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), among other offences, are clearly made out in the FIR filed against Dua.\nOn the question of whether Dua, being a journalist, is entitled to the protective measure of a preliminary inquiry, Senior Advocate Mahesh Jethmalani, representing the complainant, argued\n\"It is not that a journalist is bereft of a preliminary inquiry. (But) it will be left to the discretion of investigating agencies.\"\nSolicitor General Tushar Mehta added that Dua's was a simple case concerning whether the powers of Section 482 CrPC or Article 32 of the Constitution must be applied to quash the FIR.\nIf the Court finds that a case is made out, larger issues of journalistic expression etc. may not be looked into, Mehta had submitted.\nThe Court in its judgment ruled that statements made by Dua regarding COVID-19 lockdown at best were \"expression of disapprobation of actions of the Government and its functionaries so that prevailing situation could be addressed quickly and efficiently\". \nThey were certainly not made with the intent to incite people or showed tendency to create disorder or disturbance of public peace by resort to violence, which are the necessary ingredients to make out an offence of sedition under Section 124A IPC, the Court said. \n\"It may be that certain factual details regarding the date when the lockdown came into effect were not completely correct. However, considering the drift of the entire talk show and all the statements put together it cannot be said that the petitioner crossed the limits set out in the decision of this Court in Kedar Nath Singh judgment,\" the judgment stated. \nHence, the Court said that both sedition and public mischief cannot be made out against Dua. \n\"We are, therefore, of the firm view that the prosecution of the petitioner for the offences punishable under Sections 124A and 505 (1) (b) of the IPC3 would be unjust. Those offences, going by the allegations in the FIR and other attending circumstances, are not made out at all and any prosecution in respect thereof would be violative of the rights of the petitioner guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution,\" the Court concluded. \nOn the charge of defamation under Section 501 IPC, the Court at the outset stated that cognizance of the same can be taken only on a complaint made by aggrieved person and not third party. Even otherwise, there is nothing defamatory in the statements attributed to Dua, the Court ruled quashing the charge under the said provision too. \nRegarding the charge under Section 268 IPC, the Court observed that provision is nothing but the definition of 'Public Nuisance' and is not a penal provision in itself which prescribes any punishment. It was also not the case of the respondent that any penal provision involving element of 'Public Nuisance' was attracted in the instant case.\nThe said charge was also, therefore, quashed by the Court. \nThe Delhi police had also registered an FIR against Dua on June 4 for his March 30 video. That FIR was, however, stayed by the Delhi high court on June 10."}
{"ID": "id_220", "Summary": "A seven-judge Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court on Wednesday held that while unstamped arbitration agreements are inadmissible, they are not rendered void ab initio (void from the beginning) on account of the fact that they are unstamped [In Re: interplay between Indian Stamp Act and Indian Arbitration Act].\nEffect of not paying duty renders an instrument inadmissible and not void and non-payment of stamp duty is curable, the Court held overruling its 5-judge bench decision in NN Global Mercantile Pvt Ltd v. Indo Unique Flame Ltd & Ors case.\nThe Court ruled that the aspect of whether the arbitration agreement has been stamped or not, is for the arbitral tribunal to decide and not courts. To arrive at this principle, the Court relied on the doctrine of competence-competence which concerns the tribunal's power to rule on its jurisdiction. \n\"Parties to arbitration agreement conferred jurisdiction on arbitral tribunal, When parties pen their signatures to arbitration agreement they are regarded to independently sign the arbitration agreement. In process the separability provision gives rise to doctrine of competence. The negative aspect of doctrine of competence is that it limits courts interference at referral stage and arbitral tribunal given a chance to rule on their own jurisdiction,\" the Court said.\nThe unanimous ruling was passed by a Bench of Chief Justice of India (CJI) DY Chandrachud and Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul, Sanjiv Khanna, BR Gavai, Surya Kant, JB Pardiwala and Manoj Misra.\nSix judges on the bench including the CJI delivered the lead judgment, whereas Justice Khanna authored a separate but concurring opinion.\nThe conclusions in the lead judgment were summarised by CJI Chandrachud as follows: \n- Agreements which are not stamped or are inadequately stamped are inadmissible in evidence under Section 35 of the Stamp Act. Such agreements are not rendered void or void ab initio or unenforceable;\n- Non-stamping or inadequate stamping is a curable defect; \n- An objection as to stamping does not fall for determination under Sections 8 or 11 of the Arbitration Act. The concerned court must examine whether the arbitration agreement prima facie exists; \n- Any objections in relation to the stamping of the agreement fall within the ambit of the arbitral tribunal;\n\"The corollary of doctrine of competence is that court may only see if an arbitration agreement exists. Whether stamp duty is paid or not would need detail merit of evidence etc. Interpretation accorded to Stamp Act does not allow law to be flouted and it ensures that Arbitration Act does not detract from Stamp Act,\" the Court said.\nThe verdict by the seven-judge Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court came in a case concerning the validity of arbitration agreements embedded in unstamped documents. \nThe bench had reserved its verdict on October 12.\nIn September, the Supreme Court had referred a five-judge Constitution Bench judgment on the issue in NN Global Mercantile Pvt Ltd v. Indo Unique Flame Ltd & Ors to a seven-judge bench for reconsideration.\nThe five-judge Constitution Bench in NN Global had on April 25 held by a 3:2 opinion that unstamped arbitration agreements are not valid in law.\nSoon after, the Union Law Ministry constituted an expert committee to recommend reforms to the Arbitration and Conciliation Act and to examine the functioning of arbitration law in the country.\nWhile the questions of law were answered by the seven-judge bench today, the Court informed that the curative petition before it is yet to be decided on facts. \n\"We have held reference is maintainable. We have kept curative open on facts. We have resolved questions of law. We have said section 35 of stamp act is unambiguous,\" CJI Chandrachud said. \nThe matter concerns a Karnataka High Court order passed in 2014.\nIn December 2014, the High Court held a lease deed with an arbitration agreement between the parties as valid and appointed an arbitrator. In February 2020, a three-judge Supreme Court Bench set aside this order.\nThe case arose after a charitable trust (respondents) had entered into a lease agreement with the appellants to develop a multi-purpose community hall and office complex, as well as for the renovation of some properties on their land. The agreement, which was for 38 years, was signed in 1996 and contained a clause for a security deposit of ₹55 lakh.\nIn 2008, a suit was filed by the trust against the appellants, pointing out that only ₹25 lakh had been deposited, while a samadhi in the property had been desecrated. Further, the appellants were accused of trying to file a fresh sale deed in connivance with some of the trust's members.\nThe Bengaluru City Civil Court passed an interim order of status quo. Two years after the suit proceedings commenced, the appellants invoked the arbitration clause before the Karnataka High Court in 2013.\nNotably, after the orders of a single-judge, the Judicial Registrar noted that the document in question was a lease deed and not an agreement to lease. Therefore, the Registrar directed the appellants to pay a deficit stamp duty and penalty of ₹1,01,56,388.\nHowever, the High Court subsequently ignored the Registrar's findings and appointed an arbitrator. In 2020, the Supreme Court set aside the High Court's order.\nA curative petition was filed in the matter following the dismissal of a review petition by the Supreme Court in July 2021 on the ground of delay. \nThe Court delivered its verdict today in this curative petition. \n\"A historic and the fastest ever curative verdict which boosts the Arbitration Ecosystem of India by not only upholding the legislative intent of the Arbitration Act but also the salutary doctrines of party autonomy, separability and kompetenz – kompetenz whilst simultaneously balancing the interests of the exchequer. A progressive unanimous as well as a candid concurring judgment, which puts to rest retrograde controversies,\" Kunal Vajani, Joint Managing Partner at Fox & Mandal and Court Member (India) - ICC International Court of Arbitration said on the judgment."}
{"ID": "id_222", "Summary": "Reservation for backward classes is not at odds with merit but it furthers distributive impact, the Supreme Court said on Thursday while upholding the 27 percent quota for Other Backward Classes (OBC) in National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) All India Quota (AIQ) seats in State government medical institutions [Neil Aurelio Nunes v. Union of India].\nA Bench of Justices DY Chandrachud and AS Bopanna said that competitive exams do not reflect economic social advantage which is accrued to some classes.\n\"Articles 15(4) and 15 (5) are not an exception to Article 15 (1), which itself sets out the principle of substantive equality (including the recognition of existing inequalities). Thus, Articles 15 (4) and 15 (5) become a restatement of a particular facet of the rule of substantive equality that has been set out in Article 15 (1);,\" the Court said. \nThe top court further held that merit cannot be reduced to narrow definitions of performance in an open competitive examination which only provides formal equality of opportunity.\n\"Competitive examinations assess basic current competency to allocate educational resources but are not reflective of excellence, capabilities and potential of an individual which are also shaped by lived experiences, subsequent training and individual character. Crucially, open competitive examinations do not reflect the social, economic and cultural advantage that accrues to certain classes and contributes to their success in such examinations,\" the judgment said.\nThe verdict came on a petition challenging reservation for OBC and Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) introduced by the Central government in the AIQ seats in State government medical institutions.\nThe Court had, by way of a short order on January 7, upheld the reservation of 27 percent for OBCs in AIQ seats.\nHowever, it had not given detailed reasons for the same, which it did today by way of today's judgment.\nThe scheme of AIQ, the verdict said, was devised to allot seats in State-run medical institutions.\n\"The Union Government was not required to seek the permission of this Court before providing reservation in AIQ seats. Therefore, providing reservation in the AIQ seats is a policy decision of the Government, which will be subject to the contours of judicial review similar to every reservation policy,\" the judgment stated.\nOn the concept merit, an oft-repeated argument, to decry reservation, the Court said that high scores in an examination are not a proxy for merit.\n\"Merit should be socially contextualized and reconceptualized as an instrument that advances social goods like equality that we as a society value. In such a context, reservation is not at odds with merit but furthers its distributive consequences,\" the Bench held. \nThe Court, however, said that the validity of criteria for determining EWS quota will have to be heard at length by the Court later in March this year.\n\"For EWS, we have said that argument of petitioners in validity of EWS was not limited to its share in AIQ but also on the basis criteria. Thus, it needs to be heard in detail,\" the Court said.\nMeanwhile, the admissions to the NEET postgraduate (PG) courses for the year 2021 will be held as per the existing reservation of 27 percent for OBCs and 10 percent for EWS.\n\"Any change in the eligibility status for reservation at this stage would have caused confusion and led to possible litigation challenging such a change. This would have only caused further delay. We are still in the midst of the pandemic and any delay in the recruitment of doctors would impact the ability to manage the pandemic. Hence, it is necessary to avoid any further delays in the admission process and allow counselling to begin immediately. As a result, we allow the implementation of EWS reservation in AIQ seats in NEET UG and PG seats for the academic year of 2021-2022,\" the top court reasoned. \nThe Court also noted that the notification dated July 29, 2021, was issued much before the exams were conducted and the counselling process was to begin. \n\"It cannot be said that the rules for the game were set when the registrations closed on 15 March 2021 as has been urged on behalf of the petitioners,\" the Bench ruled."}
{"ID": "id_224", "Summary": "The Supreme Court on Thursday ruled that the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has powers under the NGT Act 2010 to take suo motu cognizance of matters based on letter petitions and media reports (Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai v. Ankita Sinha).\nThe judgment was delivered by a three-judge Bench of Justices AM Khanwilkar, Hrishikesh Roy and CT Ravikumar in batch of appeals. \n\"Given the multifarious role envisaged for the NGT and the purposive interpretation which ought to be given to the statutory provisions, it would be fitting to regard the NGT as having the mechanism to set in motion all necessary functions within its domain and this, as would follow from the discussion below, should necessarily clothe it with the authority to take suo motu cognizance of matters, for effective discharge of its mandate,\" the Court ruled.\nThe top court held that it was essential for the nation’s well-being to have a flexible mechanism while addressing issues relating to environmental damage and the climate change that comes from it.\n“In circumstances where adverse environmental impact may be egregious, but the community affected is unable to effectively get the machinery into action, a forum created specifically to address such concerns should surely be expected to move with expediency, and of its own accord.. The NGT, with the distinct role envisaged for it, can hardly afford to remain a mute spectator when no-one knocks on its door,” the judgment said.\nIn this regard the Court emphasised on need for purposive interpretation of the National Green Tribunals (NGT) Act, noting that the intention behind a statute should receive careful consideration. \nThe NGT, the apex court said, was intended to address wide ranging societal concerns.\n“The statute will have to be read in its entirety and each provision of the Act must be given its due meaning by comprehending the mischief it intends to remedy. The mischief that the NGT Act attempted to remedy were underscored in the legislative history, and the pronouncements of the constitutional Courts flagging their environmental concerns,” the judgment stated,\nFurther applying the tool of interpretation, the Bench discussed provisions of the NGT Act and observed that the rules stipulate wide discretionary powers for the tribunal to secure ends of justice. It was clarified that the power is also coupled with a duty to exercise discretion to achieve this objective.\n“Securing justice is a term of wide amplitude and does not simply mean adjudicating disputes between two rival entities. It also encompasses inter alia, advancing causes of environmental rights, granting compensation to victims of calamities, creating schemes for giving effect to the environmental principles and even hauling up authorities for inaction, when need be.”\nIn this regard, the Court placed reliance on the judgments in Vellore Citizens’ Welfare Forum vs. UOI and M.C. Mehta vs. UOI, to stress that the parliament conferred wide jurisdiction on the NGT so that it can deal with issues relating to the environment being dealt with by High Courts or the Supreme Court.\n“The NGT is not just an adjudicatory body,” observed the judgment reiterating that it performs functions such as prevention, remedy and amelioration as well.\nThe Bench also discussed the judgment in Mantri Techzone (P) Ltd. vs. Forward Foundation wherein the top court had recognised that the NGT was set up under the constitutional mandate to enforce Article 21 with respect to the environment and, therefore, had special jurisdiction for enforcement of environmental rights.\nThe judgment also highlighted the uniqueness of the NGT as opposed to other tribunals and noted that the Court had appositely observed that the forum had a duty to justice while exercising “wide range of jurisdiction” and the “wide range of powers”.\nIn the context of the NGT’s sui generis role, the Bench referred to the judgment in DG NHAI vs. Aam Aadmi Lokmanch. \n“Its personnel include technically qualified and experienced members. The powers it exercises and directions it can potentially issue, impact not merely those before it, but also state agencies and state departments whose views are heard, after which general directions to prevent the future occurrence of incidents that impact the environment, are issued,” the Court observed.\nTherefore, the Court concluded that the NGT was conceived as a specialized forum not only as a like substitute for a civil court but more importantly to take over all the environment related cases from the High Courts and the Supreme Court.\nThe duty to safeguard rights under Article 21 of the Constitution cannot stand on the narrow compass of interpretation, the judgment underscored.\n“Procedural provisions must be allowed to fall in step with the substantive rights that are invoked in the environmental domain, in larger public interest,” the Bench said.\nHeavy reliance was placed on the wide implications an NGT decision has on socio-economic dimensions and public at large. \n“The concept of environmental justice is a trifecta of distributive justice, procedural justice and justice as recognition. Environmental equity as a developing concept has focused on the disproportionate implications of environmental harms on the economically or socially marginalized groups.”\nSenior Advocates V Giri, Krishnan Venugopal and Sajan Poovyya appeared for the appellants. The Respondents were represented by Senior Advocates Nidhesh Gupta, Sanjay Parikh and Anand Grover."}
{"ID": "id_225", "Summary": "The Bombay High Court recently upheld the acquittal of a government medical officer for allegedly taking a bribe of ₹100 from a patient for the issue of a medical certificate. [State of Maharashtra v. Dr Anil Shinde]\nJustice Jitendra Jain found that the amount of ₹100 seemed to be too small (as a bribe) for the year 2007, as well as in 2023. \nHence, it was a fit case to be treated as a trivial matter, the judge said while upholding the doctor's acquittal. \n“In the instant case, the allegation is acceptance of a bribe of ₹100/- in the year 2007. The amount appears to be too small in the year 2007 and more so, in the year 2023 when the appeal is being heard against the acquittal. Therefore, assuming that the appellant-complainant is able to prove the charges (although, I have already held that they have failed to prove the charges), in my view after considering quantum at the relevant time this could be a fit case to be treated as a trivial matter to uphold the acquittal order,” the judge ruled.\nThe Court noted that there was a provision under the Prevention of Corruption Act, Section 20(3), which stated that if the alleged bribe of gratification is trivial, then no inference of corruption may be drawn and the court may refuse to presume that the accused is corrupt.\nThe Court proceeded to observe that the alleged gratification in this case was trivial. Therefore, Justice Jain agreed with the trial court's decision to acquit the medical officer.\n“The view taken by the trial court is a plausible view based on appreciation of evidence. Therefore, in view of the above discussion, the order of acquittal passed by the special judge would not require interference and the present appeal is to be dismissed,” the High Court held.\nThe case before the Court had been filed against one, Dr Anil Shinde, who was appointed as a medical officer in September 1995 by the State of Maharashtra. He had been posted at a rural hospital in Paud, Pune district. \nThe complainant, Laxman Pingale claimed that in 2007, the doctor demanded ₹100 for issuing a medical certificate to certify Pingale’s injuries.\nShinde had allegedly treated the wounds but demanded a bribe for issuing the certificate.\nThe patient, Pingale lodged a complaint with the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) and a trap was laid in February 2007. \nOn February 20, a team of ACB visited the hospital and allegedly caught the medical officer in the act.

The Director General of Police].\n- A class 12 student committed suicide, and in a private video alleged that a correspondent from her school spoke to her parents about conversion to Christianity.\n- When the Superintendent of police said in a press conference that the conversion angle was ruled out, the child’s father moved the High Court seeking a transfer of the investigation.\n- The petitioner submitted that the education minister and two other “high ranking ministers” had given their opinions, absolving the school authorities of conversion.\n- The school vehemently denied any allegations of attempts to convert.\n- Justice GR Swaminathan who heard the father's petition opined that the investigation was not on the right lines and thus, transferred the case to the CBI\nThe single-judge had reserved orders in the case on Friday, after hearing all parties at length.\nThe deceased child had consumed pesticide when she was in the hostel. The judicial magistrate recorded her dying declaration.\nIn her police statement as well as in her statement before the judicial magistrate, the child directly and in unambiguous terms accused the hostel warden of burdening her with non-academic chores as a result of which, she consumed the pesticide.\nAt a later stage, a private video implicating the school’s correspondent began circulating on social media. When the same was brought to the notice of the Superintendent of Police, she told a reporter that in the preliminary enquiry, the religious conversion angle was not made out.\nThis led to the petitioner losing faith in the investigation and thus, he moved the High Court.\nThe Additional Public Prosecutor argued that the Court would not be justified to interfere with the investigation as it was not for the Court to micro-manage it since the province of an investigation is exclusively reserved for the executive.\nThe counsel for the school denied allegations of attempting to convert the deceased child to Christianity and argued that certain groups were trying to besmirch the school’s fair reputation.\nThe single-judge was of the opinion that the investigation was not proceeding on the right lines, especially since a high ranking minister had taken a stand on the matter. Hence, the investigation cannot continue with State Police, the Court said.\n“This Court has a duty to render posthumous justice to the child. The foregoing circumstances cumulatively taken will definitely create an impression that the investigation is not proceeding on the right lines,” the judgment said.\nThe Court also noted that the petitioner was justified in entertaining the impression of bias since by stating that the conversion angle stood ruled out, the SP had brushed aside the petitioner's complaint made in writing which was backed by the child’s video.\n“The Superintendent of Police probably forgot the virtues of silence.. I fail to understand as to why the Thanjavur Superintendent of Police reacted as if she had come in contact with a live electric wire,” the Court said in its order.\nNoting that there was nothing “inherently improbable” in the allegation that there was an attempt at conversion, the judge noted that the matter called for an investigation into the claim’s veracity, not an outright rejection.\nTo decide on the matter of transferring the case, a judgment of the Supreme Court in Mithilesh Kumar Singh v. State of Rajasthan was relied on, where the top court was also concerned with the death of a young student.\nIn this case, it was held that, “though transfer of investigation from the State police to CBI can be allowed only in rare and exceptional circumstances when fair investigation by the State police does not inspire confidence on account of any external influence or otherwise, there can be no cast iron parameters and whether an exceptional situation has arisen may be determined by the court by taking an overview of the fact situation of a particular case.”\nThus, Director of the Central Bureau of Investigation, was asked to assign an officer to take over investigation from the State Police.\nThe trial court was also directed to dispose of the warden’s plea for bail based on the available materials since her continued incarceration may not serve any purpose.\nBefore parting with the judgment, Justice Swaminathan narrated a personal experience. \n“The Ganesha idol which I worship daily has been named as Fr. Pillaiyar. Because it was gifted to me by the learned Senior Counsel who appeared for the Congregation. Dr. Fr. Xavier Arul Raj, the Senior Counsel and Br. Benitto, the counsel on record are genuine ambassadors of interfaith fraternity. When the learned Senior Counsel asserted that he does not believe in conversion, I knew that he was speaking from his heart.”\nHe ended the judgment expressing hope that the CBI would bring out the truth to whether Sister Saghayamary and Sister Rachel Mary were made from the same fibre as the Senior Counsel.\nAdvocate M Karthikeya Venkatachalapathy appeared for the petitioner. \nThe Respondents were represented by Additional Public Prosecutor T. Senthil Kumar. \nSenior Advocate Dr. Fr. Xavier Arulraj along with advocates Amala Irudhaya Mary and Menitto appeared for the school."}
{"ID": "id_232", "Summary": "A Court in Delhi on Wednesday found Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA Prakash Jarwal and his aide Kapil Nagar guilty of abetting the suicide of 52-year-old Dr. Rajendra Singh, who owned water tankers that were used by the Delhi Jal Board.\nThe two men were also found guilty of being part of a criminal conspiracy to extort money from water tanker owners in the national capital.\nAdditional Sessions Judge MK Nagpal concluded that Jarwal and Nagar were “continuously and consistently” making demands for extortion of different amounts of money from the victim.\nThe duo was held to have acted to create tremendous pressure upon the victim’s mind, which was depicted in around 40 statements authored by the victim, the Court found. \nThe prosecution's case was that the accused would threaten the victim and other water tanker owners for payment of monthly extortion amounts. \nIt was also alleged that money was demanded from water tanker owners as “election expenses” at the time of the assembly polls in 2020.\nThe threats pertained to the payment of money in connection with the running or plying of the water tankers with the Delhi Jal Board. \nIn particular, the allegation against Jarwal was that he had used his influence as an MLA and a member of the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) to remove Singh’s tankers from the DJB and to stop his pending payments.\nThe Court found Jarwal and Nagar guilty of abetment of suicide under Section 306 of Indian Penal Code (IPC) despite most of the witnesses, including the victim’s wife and son, turning hostile. \nJudge Nagar opined that the same was apparently “due to the fear of the accused persons and their other associates.”\nThe Court rejected the defence's argument that Singh was suffering from certain physical and mental conditions. The Court said no such serious physical or mental ailment could be inferred from the evidence on record.\n“Though it has been stated in court by some witnesses that the deceased was a sugar and heart patient and a stent was also earlier implanted for his heart   ailment, but these facts by themselves cannot be taken as a reason behind commission of suicide by deceased as it is very common to have one or the other ailment these days even in young age…,” it added.\nThe Court also opined that though the mental state of a person who takes the extreme step of suicide would certainly be weaker as compared to a normal person, it does not mean that a person commits suicide only because of a weak mental state.\nThe Court also found that the charge of criminal conspiracy for extortion under Section 386 of the IPC stood proved against the accused, based on dying declarations left by the deceased as well as the other corroborative evidence.\nHowever, on the charge of actual extortion, the Court concluded that there was sufficient evidence only to prove that an attempt had been made to commit the offences.\n“It is so because the evidence on record duly shows that both these accused  had intentionally put the deceased in fear of his death or of the death of his family members by extending threats for payment of different amounts of money…,” the order states.\nThe Court further opined that the prosecution had failed to prove the payment of extortion amounts by the deceased and other water tankers to the accused, particularly since most of the witnesses had turned hostile.\n“In the absence of there being any independent or corroborative evidence showing the transfer or payment of these amounts by deceased or the other water tanker owners to any of the above two accused or even to their associates on their behalf, the evidence led on record in support of these charges can be held deficient and insufficient for proving the said charges,\" the Court concluded.\nHowever, it also opined that even in the absence of any corroborative or independent evidence showing proof of payments of extortion money as stated in dying declarations, the prosecution can be said to have successfully proved the charge of attempts to commit the offence of extortion.\nIt also found sufficient evidence for proving the charge of criminal conspiracy for criminal intimidation under the second part of Section 506 of the IPC. \nHaving found Jarwal and Nagar guilty of the offences, before deciding the punishment and the amount of compensation to be paid to the victim’s family, the Court directed the convicts to file their affidavits disclosing their assets and income.\nThe direction was passed in accordance with a Delhi High Court judgement that also requires the prosecution to file an affidavit regarding the expenses incurred on the prosecution of the case.\nThe matter will be heard next on March 13."}

State of Maharashtra].\nA Division Bench of Justices Revati Mohite-Dere and RN Laddha quashed a First Information Report (FIR) lodged against a 33-year-old man under Section 3 (spying) of the Official Secrets Act for clicking photographs of a written complaint filed against him at the Mira Road Police Station in Mumbai.\nThe Bench, while reiterating that a police station is not a 'prohibited place' under the Act, said that the police can at the most put up a display board against photography.\n\"Police Station do not come within the definition of 'prohibited place', as defined in the law. Police Stations are places, where people are free to go/walk in, to lodge a complaint/FIR, to redress the wrong/injustice done to them. It is always open for the police to put up a board prohibiting photography but if one does take a photo/video, certainly, the said act would not come within the ambit of the Official Secrets Act,\" the order stated.\nPertinently, a Bench led by Justice Mohite-Dere had passed a similar order on December 22 last year, by which it had quashed an FIR under the Act law against a man who had clicked photos of a police station from outside. \nIn that order, the Bench had highlighted the continued misuse of the provisions of the Official Secrets Act by police in several cases.\n\"Invocation of section 3 of the Act, can have drastic consequences on the person against whom it is invoked. It could impact one's reputation, job, career and so on. It cannot be lightly invoked, to jeopardize someone's life and career. Law cannot be misused or abused and must not be used as a tool for harassing or tormenting person,\" the Bench had observed.\nIn the present case, the Bench noted,\n\"Prima facie, the Official Secrets Act appears to have been malafidely invoked by the concerned Police. By no stretch of imagination, section 3 could have been invoked in the facts of the present case...Law cannot be used as an instrument to oppress and harrass people. Police being the custodians of law are duty bound to uphold it and not misuse it.\"\nIt thus ordered the State to pay costs of ₹25,000 to the petitioner and quashed the FIR.\nAdvocate Anees Shaikh appeared for the petitioner.

{"ID": "id_234", "Summary": "The Supreme Court on Monday said that the Gujarat government was \"complicit and acted in tandem\" with the convict who had earlier approached the Supreme Court for a decision on his plea for premature release in the Bilkis Bano gang rape case.\nThe bench of Justices BV Nagarathna and Ujjal Bhuyan said that the Gujarat government should have filed a review petition against the Supreme Court judgment of May 2022 that declared the State to be competent to decide the plea for remission of convicts in the case.\nThe bench concluded that the Court was misled by suppression of facts in the earlier plea and that use of power by Gujarat to grant relief to the convicts after the May 2022 ruling amounted to usurpation of power of Maharashtra government.\n“It was the State of Maharashtra [which] could have only passed the remission orders respondent no 3 [convict] surreptitiously filed the plea before the Supreme Court. Taking advantage of May 13 order of this court, other convicts also filed remission applications and this Gujarat government passed remission orders. Gujarat was complicit and acted in tandem with respondent no. 3 (convict) in this case. This court was misled by suppressing facts. Use of power by Gujarat was only an usurpation of power by the State.”\nWhile setting aside Gujarat government's decision to allow premature release of the convicts, the Court said,\n\"State of Gujarat had earlier correctly contended that the appropriate government was Maharashtra, which was in accordance with 437 CrPC ... though it was set aside by the Supreme Court. Gujarat could have filed a review petition,\"\nThe top court added that it failed to understand why the Gujarat government did not file a review seeking correction of the May 13, 2022 ruling.\nLooking into the law on premature release of convicts, the Court noted that the appropriate government is required to take permission of the court before passing remission orders.\n\"This means that place of occurrence or place of imprisonment of convicts are not relevant for remission,\" it opined while setting aside the orders on ground of usurpation of powers by Gujarat government.\nOn the Supreme Court's May 2022 ruling that held Gujarat to be competent to decide the plea for premature release of the convicts, the bench headed by Justice Nagarathna found that the convict who had approached the top court had suppressed the material facts.\nThe convict had not disclosed that Gujarat High Court had dismissed his plea for decision by Gujarat government and after that he had filed the application of premature release in Maharashtra and not Gujarat, it noted.\nThe Court found the convict to have \"played fraud\" with it, as it reasoned that if he were aggrieved by the Gujarat High Court order, he could have filed an appeal before the top court.\nHowever, it noted that he instead moved Maharashtra government for remission and when the opinion there was negative, he moved the Supreme Court.\nThe High Court order could not have been set aside in an Article 32 plea, the top court said.\nDue to the suppression of the facts, the bench headed by Justice Nagarathna held the earlier ruling as non est and invalid in law.\n\"May 13, 2022 order of this court is also per incuriam since it does not follow the binding decision of the nine judge bench of the Supreme court where a HC order cannot be set aside in a PIL..,\" it added.\nRead more about the judgment here and here."}

Justice Shriram said, \nParle had submitted before the Court that it had secured trademark registration of its packaging under the Trade Marks Act, 1999. Parle further pointed out that it had spent substantial amounts of money and efforts to popularise and familiarize the consumers with their packaging. \nThe High Court, in turn, opined that there was a strong prima facie case made out in Parle's favour for the grant of an interim injunction against Future Consumer. The Court added that Parle would suffer irreparable injury to its reputation and goodwill if the ad-interim reliefs are not granted. \n\"The balance of convenience is also in favour of Plaintiffs. There are no equities in favour of Defendants\", the Court said. \nTherefore, it has now directed Future Consumer to refrain from reproducing, publishing, communicating to the public its Tasty Treat packaging (which is under dispute) or from using any layout, packaging etc. that is identical with and or deceptively similar to Parle’s packaging.\nFurther, the Court has also allowed Parle's prayer to seize the products using such packaging in the meanwhile.

Indian Medical Association]. \nA bench of Justices BR Gavai and BV Nagarathna ruled that prescription of minimum standards for higher education, authorities to recognise or de-recognise an institution etc. are areas over which exclusive legislative competence to make law lies with the parliament under Entry 66 List 1 of the Constitution, and not the State legislature.\nThe State legislatures on the other hand under Entry 25 of List 3 of the Constitution possess legislative competence to legislate with respect to all other aspects of education except the determination of minimum standards and coordination, the Court said.\nHence, State legislature lacks the competence in the area of prescription of minimum standards for medical education, the Court underlined.\n\"The Assam Act which seeks to regulate such aspects of medical education is therefore liable to be set aside on the ground that the State legislature lacks competence to legislate wrt the aspects enumerated above,\" the Court ordered.\nThe appellants had challenged an order of the High Court which struck down the Assam Act.\nThey argued that as per the Supreme Court's decision in the case of R Chitralekha v State of Mysore, only when the state legislation makes it impossible or difficult for the parliament to legislate, can it be struck down and not otherwise.\nOn the other hand, the respondents said that students graduating for the diploma course would be ill-equipped as doctors. This would pose a risk to patients who require quality medical assistance and treatment, they further argued.\nAdditionally, it was highlighted that it was the fundamental right of a patient to receive quality medical assistance which meets the standards prescribed by the Indian Medical Council or by the parliament. However, this could not be provided by those who do not have requisite qualifications as per the standards set.\nIn its judgment, the top court also noted that the State had enacted the Assam Community Professional Registration and Competency Act in 2015 to remove the basis of the High Court judgment and to restore the position of the diploma holders. \n\"The basis of the impugned judgment has been removed and therefore, that is constitutionally valid,\" the Court said.\nThe Court also held that the the Assam Act is in conflict with the central law, the Indian Medical Council Act.\n\"Hence, when there is a direct conflict between a State law and Union law, in a matter of coordination and determination of standards in higher education, State law cannot have any validity,\" the Court ruled.\nThe Court also discussed the reasoning of the High Court that the Assam Act was void on account of repugnancy as per Article 254 of the Constitution since there was no Presidential assent.\nIt was noted that the doctrine of repugnancy would not apply in the case at hand. \n\"The Assam Act and Rules and Regulations made under the said Act, being in conflict with the Indian Medical Council Act, 1956 (IMC Act, 1956) and the Rules and Regulations made thereunder, the doctrine of repugnancy as such would not apply within the meaning of Article 254 of the Constitution.\""}
{"ID": "id_240", "Summary": "The Karnataka High Court has ruled that failing to disclose assets or concealing assets of a candidate, their spouse, or dependents constitutes a corrupt practice. [Abida Begum v Mohd Ismail & Ors]\nThe Court observed that such actions could result in the disqualification of the candidate from participating in a panchayat election under the Karnataka Gram Swaraj and Panchayat Raj Act.\nThe Court added that such suppression by itself is enough to attract disqualification and that there is no requirement to prove that the suppression resulted in an adverse impact on the election prospects of another candidate. \n\"There is no particular requirement for the election petitioner to specifically aver or prove that the suppression has resulted in adverse impact favourable to the returned of 2022 candidate in the election. The mere suppression is sufficient to invoke the provisions of Section 19(1)(b) of the Panchayat Raj Act,\" the Court explained.\nA Bench of Justice Suraj Govindaraj made these observations while dealing with a challenge to an October 2022 trial court order, that had quashed the election of a candidate, Abida Begum, to a gram panchayat.\nThe said order was passed after one, Mohammed Ismail challenged Abida Begum's election on the ground that she had failed to disclose her and her husband's assets. The said suppression would amount to a corrupt practice by Abida Begum in terms of Section 19(1)(b) of the Panchayat Raj Act, Ismail had contended.\nAbida Begum eventually challenged the trial court's order in Ismail's election petition before the High Court. \nThe Court relied on various Supreme Court judgments to observe that the purity of election at all levels, be it election to the Union Parliament or a State Legislature or a Municipal Corporation, or Panchayat is of national importance, in which area uniform policies are desirable in the interest of all the States.\nTherefore, disclosure of assets has to be made by the candidate, spouse of the candidate and other dependent members, the Court said.\n\"It is not only suggestio falsi ie., suggesting of false information regarding the assets but also suppressio veri i.e., suppression of details relating to the assets which would be covered under Section 19 of the Panchayat Raj Act. That is to say suggestio falsi and suppressio veri of assets of the candidate, his or her spouse and dependent would come within the purview of Section 19 (1)(b) of the Panchayat Raj Act,\" the Court further observed.\nIn this case, the Court held that it was the responsibility of the petitioner to reveal her assets, her husband's assets, as well as those of other dependent members. Non-disclosure of the same would, therefore, amount to undue influence and a corrupt practice, the Court said.\nAll the same, the Court allowed Abida Begum's writ petition on account of Ismail's failure to make all the candidates who contested in the elections a party to the election case proceedings. \nThe High Court agreed with Begum's contention that under Section 15(2)(a) of the Karnataka Gram Swaraj and Panchayat Raj Act, 1993, all the electoral contestants should have been made party to the election case if Ismail was seeking a declaration as the successful or returned candidate. \nAs such, the High Court opined that the trial court ought to have dismissed the election petition in limine, since all such contesting electoral candidates were not arraigned as parties to the case. \nHowever, the Court also noted that such cases involve practical difficulties. Since there are multiple candidates contesting in elections, it would be very difficult, \"if not impossible\" to determine who can be declared the successful candidate in such cases. \n\"Even if there are three candidates, the matter could be difficult inasmuch as it cannot be ascertained as to in whose favour the votes polled by the returning candidate would have to be apportioned,\" the judge pointed out. \nTherefore, Justice Govindraj has asked the Law Commission of India to be sent a copy of his order so that this aspect may be examined. \nAdvocate VK Nayak represented Abida Begum.

Gen. Raj Kadyan [Vinod K Gandhi v. State of Haryana & Anr].\nJustice Harkesh Manuja said that the emails on record showed that the accused, retired Group Captain Vinod K Gandhi had insinuated that Kadyan was a “coward”.\nThe same cannot be said to have been done in good faith, the Court said while further noting that there were contents also which did not suit the prestige of a decorated Army officer who had served the nation for about 40 years.\n“Even with respect to the definition of the word “coward”, it is required to be looked into whether the general meaning applicable to an ordinary person, can also be made applicable in the specific context of defence personnel, for whom it could be more insulting,” observed the Court.\nGandhi moved the High Court challenging the summoning order passed by a Magistrate in 2017 on Kadyan’s complaint and the subsequent dismissal of his revision by an Additional Session Judge.\nHis principal argument before the Court was that the case was covered under Exceptions 4 and 5 of Section 499 (defamation) of Indian Penal Code. The exceptions pertain to publication of court proceedings.\nIn this context, Gandhi’s counsel submitted that the primary grievance of Kadyan was that he had been called ‘coward’ but the same was based on the latter's service record as mentioned in a case related to his service. \nThe relevant extract is as under,\nLooking into the observations made by Kadyan’s superiors, Justice Manuja reasoned that the use of words like “...should be bold and aggressive in operation”, may not always mean in absolute terms that the complainant was designated a “coward”. \nIf someone is termed as “not bold or aggressive”, it might mean that one might not be offensive enough as demanded in war circumstances but it could not necessarily mean in all probabilities that the person is a coward, the Court added.\nThe Court also took into account the testimony of other witnesses with Kadyan’s complaint and said the trial court has rightly relied upon the preliminary evidence.\n“In the given circumstances, the exercise of going into the details of word “coward” and other alleged defamatory contents and applicability of the exceptions of Section 499 IPC can be looked into during the trial only,” it added.\nThe Court further said that the scope of interference in such cases by the High Court while exercising its power under Section 482 of Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), is very limited. \n“In view of the discussion made above, warranting no interference in the concurrent findings of the Courts below, the present petition is dismissed,” it ordered.\nAdvocate ADS Jattana represented the petitioner.\nDeputy Advocate General Rajiv Sidhu appeared for the State of Haryana\nSenior Advocate Amit Jhanji with Advocate Nandita Verma represented the complainant."}

{"ID": "id_246", "Summary": "The Supreme Court on Monday ruled that Members of Parliament (MPs) and Members of Legislative Assemblies (MLAs) cannot claim any immunity from prosecution under Articles 105 and 194 of the Constitution when they are accused of taking bribes [Sita Soren v. Union of India].\nArticle 105(2) confers on Members of Parliament (MPs) immunity from prosecution in respect of anything said or any vote given by them in Parliament or on any parliamentary committee.\nArticle 194(2) grants similar protection to Members of Legislative Assemblies (MLAs).\nA Constitution bench Chief Justice of India (CJI) DY Chandrachud with Justices AS Bopanna, MM Sundresh, PS Narasimha, JB Pardiwala, PV Sanjay Kumar and Manoj Misra delivered the unanimous verdict this morning. \nThe Court also overruled a contrary judgment rendered by it in 1998 in the case of PV Narasimha Rao v. State in which the Court had opined that legislators are immune from being prosecuted for taking bribes to vote a certain way in a legislative house. \n\"The judgment of the majority in PV Narasimha Rao (supra), which grants immunity from prosecution to a member of the legislature who has allegedly engaged in bribery for casting a vote or speaking has wide ramifications on public interest, probity in public life and parliamentary. democracy. There is a grave danger of this Court allowing an error to be perpetuated if the decision were not reconsidered,\" the Court opined.\nThe Court explained that immunity is given to legislators under Articles 105 (2) and 194 (2) in respect of anything said or done in the parliament or a legislative assembly only if a two-fold test is satisfied.\nThe two-fold test involves examining whether such action is (1) connected to the collective functioning of the legislative house and (2) the action has a functional relationship \"to the discharge of the essential duties of a legislator.\"\nThese provisions are meant to sustain an environment that facilitates free deliberations. However, such an atmosphere would be vitiated if a member is bribed to deliver a speech or vote a certain way, the Court said. \nTherefore, the Court proceeded to hold that bribery is not protected by such parliamentary privilege.\n\"An individual member of the legislature cannot assert a claim of privilege to seek immunity under Articles 105 and 194 from prosecution on a charge of bribery in connection with a vote or speech in the legislature. Such a claim to immunity fails to fulfil the twofold test that the claim is tethered to the collective functioning of the House and that it is necessary to the discharge of the essential duties of a legislator,\" the Court said. \nThe Court explained that the immunity conferred under Articles 105 and 194 is meant to help legislators say and vote freely Such action of vote or speech inside a legislative house is absolute.\n“This (speech or action without fear or favour) is exactly what is taken away when a member is induced to vote in a certain way not because of their belief or position on an issue but because of a bribe taken by the member. Corruption and bribery of members of the legislature erode the foundation of Indian Parliamentary democracy. It is destructive of the aspirational and deliberative ideals of the Constitution and creates a polity which deprives citizens of a responsible, responsive and representative democracy,” the Court proceeded to explain. \nThe Court has also ruled that just the act of taking a bribe could expose the legislator to criminal charges.\n\"The offence of bribery is complete on the acceptance of the money or on the agreement to accept money being concluded. The offence is not contingent on the performance of the promise for which money is given or is agreed to be given,\" the judgment stated.\nThe Court added that criminal courts are not excluded from hearing bribery cases against legislators, merely because the Speaker of the legislative house is empowered to deal with such cases as well. \n\"Prosecution for bribery is not excluded from the jurisdiction of the criminal court merely because it may also be treated by the House as contempt or a breach of its privilege.\"\nThe Court also clarified that the immunities under Articles 105 (2) and 194 (2) of the Constitution (as interpreted by the Court today) would also apply equally to elections to the Rajya Sabha and elections to appoint the President and Vice-President of the country. \nThe verdict came on a case dealing with the question of whether the legal immunity enjoyed by legislators under Articles 105(2) and 194(2) of the Constitution protects them from prosecution for taking bribes.\nThe bench had reserved its judgment on October 5. \nThe issue before the Supreme Court arose from a plea filed by Sita Soren, sister-in-law of former Jharkhand Chief Minister (CM) Hemant Soren. Notably, Hemant Soren had recently stepped down after the Enforcement Directorate (ED) filed a money laundering case against him. \nMeanwhile, Sita Soren was accused of taking a bribe to vote for a particular candidate in the 2012 Rajya Sabha Elections.\nA complaint was filed in 2012 with the Chief Election Commissioner of India seeking a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into the case. Sita Soren was charged with the offences of criminal conspiracy and bribery under the Indian Penal Code (IPC), and for criminal misconduct by a public servant under the Prevention of Corruption Act.\nIn 2014, while hearing her plea seeking quashing of the case, the Jharkhand High Court noted that Soren had not cast her vote for the person who had offered her the bribe. \nThe matter eventually reached the Supreme Court after Soren filed an appeal against the High Court's decision to dismiss her plea. \nEarlier in 1998, a Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court had held in PV Narasimha Rao v.

S Bajaj v. State of Uttarakhand).\nSingle-judge, Justice RC Khulbe arrived at this decision after examining the statement of the boy, Master Arjun given before Family court at Dehradun, as per which he expressed his interest to reside with his maternal uncle, Lieutenant Colonel Shakti Bajaj.\n\"As per the statement, he is very much interested to reside with his maternal uncle Lt. Col. Shakti Bajaj. Since, the mother of Arjun has passed away on May 8, 2021 and the petitioner, being the maternal uncle, has sufficient means to look after Arjun, and accordingly, in the interest of Master Arjun, it would be appropriate to give the custody of Arjun to the petitioner till September 10, 2021 (till the date of attaining majority by him),\" the Court ordered. \nAccording to Bajaj, Arjun's father Jaipreet Singh shared estranged relations with Rashmi Bajaj, biological mother of Arjun. Bajaj alleged that Rashmi had been subject to extreme mental, physical and financial harassment by Singh ever since Arjun's birth.\nThe respondent also sent a notice for divorce by mutual consent on January 6, 2021 and detained Arjun from interacting with his maternal relatives, it was alleged. \nRashmi succumbed to COVID-19 on May 8, 2021.\nThe petitioner then approached the High Court alleging that the father, who is in Indian Army and presently posted in Sikkim detained Arjun and was not allowing him to interact with the maternal relatives of the deceased. \nWhen the matter was heard by the High Court on May 18, 2021, a direction was issued to the State to produce Arjun before the Family Court in Dehradun on May 21 to record his statement. \nIn the statement before the Principal Judge at the Dehradun Family Court, it was learnt that Arjun is only 3 months away from attaining the age of majority and is currently studying in 12th grade. He also mentioned his interest and willingness to live with his maternal uncle who has the wherewithal to maintain him. \nOwing to the death of Arjun’s mother and keeping the best interest of Arjun in mind, the Court ordered the boy to be in the custody of the petitioner till he attains the age of majority. \nDuring this period, the father will have visitation rights to meet his son on the first Monday of every calendar month between 10 am to 12 noon in the chamber of Principal Judge, Family Court of Dehradun. During this window of time, the boy will be provided free access to meet and converse with the father. \nAdvocates Neela Gokhale and Abhijay Negi represented the petitioner\nDeputy Advocate General Amit Bhat, along with advocate Pankaj Joshi represented the State.\nAdvocate Shubham Aggarwal appeared on behalf of Respondent father."}
{"ID": "id_249", "Summary": "The Supreme Court on Wednesday sets aside the order of the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) convicting Advocate Mehmood Pracha for contempt of court [Mehmood Pracha v. CAT].\nA Bench of Justices KM Joseph and Hrishikesh Roy held that a denial of the right to trial, as contemplated under the Contempt of Courts Act and the Central Administrative Tribunal Rules, resulted in a miscarriage of justice.\n\"We are allowing this appeal only on the ground that the procedure under the Act and in the Rules which relate to adducing of evidence when there is a denial of charge, was not followed. We would undoubtedly have had no reservation in upholding the order if there was evidence to support the charge as framed against the appellant\" the Bench said. \nThe Supreme Court had in August last year asked Pracha to tender an unconditional apology in the contempt case. Back then, it had observed,\n\"What we are looking at is, there is not previous history to it. On condition that Mr Pracha will file an unconditional apology before the tribunal, we will consider setting aside the order and whole thing goes. He is a lawyer and he will move on. All of us commit mistakes but the idea is that one makes amends at the earliest,\" said Justice Joseph.\nPracha maintained that since he has committed no wrong, he will not apologise. The Court clarified that it was not compelling him to do anything and that the judges of the Court are not \"12 century lords of England.\"\n\"We are not like Lords here in the 12th century England. That is not the idea you see! We don't (want to) put any condition. It should be unconditional. This will serve your interest and also the dignity of the tribunal. Everyone commits mistakes. The whole idea is at some point you say sorry.\"\nWhen Pracha said that the contempt of court case was registered against him only because he was defending the \"honour of the Supreme Court\", the Bench said,\n\"You could have brought it separately here in this Court. Two wrongs cannot make a right.\nThe Bench thus asked Pracha to place on record the charges against him, after he suggested contesting the same if the matter is to be decided on merits.\nIn September last year, the CAT had held Pracha guilty of contempt, but let him off with a severe warning. The Principal Bench of the Tribunal took suo motu cognisance of the conduct of Pracha during the hearing of a case of Indian Forest Service officer Sanjiv Chaturvedi who was on deputation at AIIMS.\nChaturvedi had filed different applications with regard to recording of his Annual Confidential Reports (ACRs), it said.\n\"From the various developments that took in this case, what we gather is that the attempt was more to add to the personality of the applicant and his counsel i.e., the respondent herein, and for that purpose, the tribunal became easy target,\" the CAT had said in its order."}
{"ID": "id_25", "Summary": "In a judgment of significant import, the Supreme Court on Thursday ruled that the Central government and States have simultaneous powers to legislate on Goods and Service Tax (GST) [Union of India vs Mohit Minerals Pvt Ltd].\nA Bench of Justices DY Chandrachud, Surya Kant and Vikram Nath observed that the GST council must work in harmonious manner to achieve workable solution between the Centre and States. \n\"The Parliament and the State legislatures possess simultaneous power to legislate on GST. Article 246A does not envisage a repugnancy provision to resolve the inconsistencies between the Central and the State laws on GST,\" the judgment said. \nPertinently, the Court ruled that the recommendation of GST Council is not binding on the Central government or States but has only persuasive value.\n\"The ‘recommendations’ of the GST Council are the product of a collaborative dialogue involving the Union and States. They are recommendatory in nature. To regard them as binding edicts would disrupt fiscal federalism, where both the Union and the States are conferred equal power to legislate on GST. It is not imperative that one of the federal units must always possess a higher share in the power for the federal units to make decisions,\" the Court ruled. \nAccording to Article 246A, both parliament and State legislature have equal power to legislate on matters of taxation, the Court added.\n\"Article 246A treats the Centre and States as equal units by conferring a simultaneous power of enacting law on GST. Article 279A in constituting the GST Council envisions that neither the Centre nor the States can act independent of the other,\" the judgment said.\nInterestingly, the Court in its judgment made important observations on co-operative federalism.\nThe Court said that while the Indian Constitution necessarily provides Union government higher share of power to avoid chaos, but relation between two constitutional units may not always be collaborative.\n\"Indian federalism is a dialogue between cooperative and uncooperative federalism where the federal units are at liberty to use different means of persuasion ranging from collaboration to contestation,\" the Court emphasised. \nThe Supreme Court was hearing an appeal filed the Central government against a judgment of a division bench of the Gujarat High Court that had held two of its notifications regarding the levy of GST ultra vires the Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act (IGST Act). \nThe High Court Bench was led by Justice JB Pardiwala, now elevated to the top court. \nThe question of law was whether an Indian importer can be subject to the levy of Integrated Goods and Services Tax on a reverse-charge basis, on the component of ocean freight paid by the foreign seller to a foreign shipping line.\nThe Central government had submitted before the High Court that although tax was being paid twice on the value of ocean freight, the same was not unconstitutional as the tax is on two different aspects of the transaction, namely, the supply of service and import of goods. \nThe notifications remove the disparity between Indian and foreign shipping lines as the former are unable to claim input tax credit.\nCounsel for the respondents before the top court submitted that the objective of a tax or levy cannot validate an ultra vires levy, and that the IGST Act does not envisage a person other than the supplier or the recipient as liable to pay tax. The present levy was thus extra-territorial, it was contended. \nFurther, a cost-insurance-freight (CIF) contract is indivisible and thus, cannot be subject to separate taxes levied on goods and services portions.\nThe Supreme Court held that the provisions of the law governing GST cannot be construed to imply that any taxable person identified for payment of reverse charge would automatically become the recipient of such goods or service. \nThe deeming fiction of treating the importer as a recipient must be found in the IGST Act which the Act in this case does not create, the Court noted. \nOn the appellant's argument that the CIF contracts with the exporter and the importer must be viewed and taxed separately, the Bench observed,\n\" ... the Union Government urges that the contracts must be viewed as separate transactions, operating in silos. We are unable to subscribe to this view. The Union of India cannot be heard to urge arguments of convenience – treating the two legs of the transaction as connected when it seeks to identify the Indian importer as a recipient of services while on the other hand, treating the two legs of the transaction as independent when it seeks to tide over the statutory provisions governing composite supply.\"\nHolding that the notifications were validly issued under Sections 5(3) and 5(4) of the IGST Act, but are in violation of Section 8 of the CGST Act and the overall scheme of the GST legislation, the Bench noted,\n\"To levy the IGST on the supply of the service component of the transaction would contradict the principle enshrined in Section 8 and be in violation of the scheme of the GST legislation,\" the judgment said. \nThe Court, thus, came to the following conclusions:\n\"(i) The recommendations of the GST Council are not binding on the Union and States for the following reasons:\n(a) The deletion of Article 279B and the inclusion of Article 279(1) by the Constitution Amendment Act 2016 indicates that the Parliament intended for the recommendations of the GST Council to only have a persuasive value, particularly when interpreted along with the objective of the GST regime to foster cooperative federalism and harmony between the constituent units;\n(b) Neither does Article 279A begin with a non-obstante clause nor does Article 246A state that it is subject to the provisions of Article 279A. The Parliament and the State legislatures possess simultaneous power to legislate on GST. Article 246A does not envisage a repugnancy provision to resolve the inconsistencies between the Central and the State laws on GST. The ‘recommendations’ of the GST Council are the product of a collaborative dialogue involving the Union and States. They are recommendatory in nature. To regard them as binding edicts would disrupt fiscal federalism, where both the Union and the States are conferred equal power to legislate on GST. It is not imperative that one of the federal units must always possess a higher share in the power for the federal units to make decisions. Indian federalism is a dialogue between cooperative and uncooperative federalism where the federal units are at liberty to use different means of persuasion ranging from collaboration to contestation; and\n(c) The Government while exercising its rule-making power under the provisions of the CGST Act and IGST Act is bound by the recommendations of the GST Council. However, that does not mean that all the recommendations of the GST Council made by virtue of the power Article 279A (4) are binding on the legislature’s power to enact primary legislations;\n(ii) On a conjoint reading of Sections 2(11) and 13(9) of the IGST Act, read with Section 2(93) of the CGST Act, the import of goods by a CIF contract constitutes an “inter-state” supply which can be subject to IGST where the importer of such goods would be the recipient of shipping service;\n(iii) The IGST Act and the CGST Act define reverse charge and prescribe the entity that is to be taxed for these purposes. The specification of the recipient – in this case the importer – by Notification 10/2017 is only clarificatory. The Government by notification did not specify a taxable person different from the recipient prescribed in Section 5(3) of the IGST Act for the purposes of reverse charge;\n(iv) Section 5(4) of the IGST Act enables the Central Government to specify a class of registered persons as the recipients, thereby conferring the power of creating a deeming fiction on the delegated legislation;\n(v) The levy imposed on the ‘service’ aspect of the transaction is in violation of the principle of ‘composite supply’ enshrined under Section 2(30) read with Section 8 of the CGST Act. Since the Indian importer is liable to pay IGST on the ‘composite supply’, comprising of supply of goods and supply of services of transportation, insurance, etc. in a CIF contract, a separate levy on the Indian importer for the ‘supply of services’ by the shipping line would be in violation of Section 8 of the CGST Act.\"\nAdditional Solicitor General of India N Venkataraman appeared for the Union government. \nSenior Advocates V Sridharan, Harish Salve, Arvind Datar, Vikram Nankani and advocate Uchit Seth appeared for the respondents. \nAdvocates Rajesh Kumar Gautam, C Manickam, Rajat Mittal, and Abhishek A Rastogi appeared for the intervenors."}

This, in our view, would suffice to a large extent, in allaying the apprehensions of the general public as regards the legality of the call for hartal and also dissuade providers of public utility services from heeding to such calls for illegal hartals in future.we issue the following directions in the wake of the situation that has now arisen, where an illegal call for hartal has been made by the aforesaid persons, to the prejudice and inconvenience of the general public,\" the Court said.\nApart from this, the Court directed the State police to ensure there is no damage to property of persons or establishments which do not support the hartal. Any damages so caused must be reported to the Court, it ordered.\n\"The said details would be necessary for this Court to take remedial action to recover such losses from the perpetrators of the illegality,\" the order stated.\nIt further directed the State Police to keep in mind the provisions of the relevant penal laws, including the provisions of the Kerala Prevention of Damage to Private Property and Payment of Compensation Act, 2019 as also the provisions of Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code while registering cases against those found to be flouting the law. \n\"Adequate police protection shall also be granted to all public utility services that apprehend violence, at the hands of those supporting the illegal hartal,\" the Court said.\nThe Court recalled that it had issued an order in January 2019 in which it took note of the peculiar circumstances in the State of Kerala where calls for hartal have over the years come to carry an implied suggestion that the general public if they did not co-operate with those calling the hartal, might face threats of violence or actual violence. \nThe Court had, therefore, ordered that any person including any political party or other association of persons, that proposes to call for a general strike or hartal, should give 7 clear days' public notice of its intention to do so. \n\"We make it clear that hartals/strikes called without adhering to the above procedure, would be deemed illegal/unconstitutional, and while the same would entail adverse consequences to the person/party calling for the hartal, the said person/party would also be liable, on the principles of strict liability, for any loss/damage caused to citizens and government pursuant to the call for hartal/general strike,\" the Court's 2019 order stated.\nHowever, it noted that despite this unambiguous order, the PFI called a flash hartal yesterday, September 22.\nThe Court suo motu impleaded the PFI State General Secretary A Abdul Sathar as an additional respondent in the matter and directed the State government to file a report.\nThe matter will be taken up next on September 29.\nOn September 22, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) had conducted nation-wide raids on PFI offices. \nSeveral PFI leaders were arrested in Kerala, including PFI National Secretary VP Nasarudheen aka Nasarudheen Elamaram."}

It is the consumption of that time at the cost of other litigants, many of them in extremely dire straits, some very needy and in abject conditions,\" the Court said. \nThe Court had, earlier during the hearing, indicated their intention to reject the plea after hearing the counsel for the petitioners at length.\nIn order to avoid the dismissal, the counsel sought time to amend the petition to incorporate a factual development. This development, however, was informed by the opposing counsel to the Court at the beginning of the arguments. Taking critical note of this aspect, the Court remarked:\n\"Matters are worsened when, at the outset, before even arguments began, not only did Mr Venegavkar for the Respondent in complete fairness point out the possible need for an amendment, but we too, asked Mr Aggarwal if he wanted to amend. The answer was clearly no.

The Court, in turn, expressed its inclination to grant the petitioners leave to amend their plea to incorporate this challenge. \nHowever, the counsel for the petitioners, advocates Vijay Aggarwal and Chetan Kapadia, instead focused their submissions on the ‘unreasoned order’ passed under Section 17, PMLA. The Court was unconvinced by the petitioners' case on this aspect. \nAt this stage, when the Court indicated that it was not impressed with the arguments and was inclined to reject the case, the counsel sought leave to amend the petition. \nThe leave to amend was ultimately allowed by the Court, albeit, after imposing costs on the petitioners."}
{"ID": "id_258", "Summary": "In a significant development, the Bombay High Court on Wednesday allowed the default bail plea filed by Bhima Koregaon accused advocate Sudha Bharadwaj [Sudha Bharadwaj v. National Investigation Agency].\nThe Court also directed Bharadwaj to approach the special National Investigation Agency court which has to set out the conditions for bail.\nThe Bench of Justices SS Shinde and NJ Jamadar, however, rejected the plea filed by eight other accused Sudhir Dhawale, Rona Wilson, Surendra Gadling, Shoma Sen, Mahesh Raut, P Varavara Rao, Vernon Gonsalves and Arun Ferreira.\nBharadwaj has been in jail since August 2018 when she was arrested from Delhi and taken to Mumbai where she has been lodged.\nBharadwaj, a lawyer and activist who has worked for rights of tribal communities and others in Chhattisgarh, was teaching at the prestigious National Law University, Delhi at the time of her arrest.\nThe Bench pronounced its verdict today in two pleas:\n- one filed by Sudha Bharadwaj seeking default bail under Code of Criminal Procedure on the ground that Pune Sessions Judges KD Vadane and RM Pande had no jurisdiction to pass orders in the case;\n- second filed by Sudhir Dhawale, Rona Wilson, Surendra Gadling, Shoma Sen, Mahesh Raut, P Varavara Rao, Vernon Gonsalves and Arun Ferreira challenging orders by Pande take cognisance of the chargesheet and rejecting the default bail application under Section 167(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.\nBharadwaj’s plea filed through advocate Yug Mohit Chaudhry, submitted that upon expiry of 90 days of detention, there was no valid or lawful order extending time for the filing of the chargesheet, and hence Bharadwaj is entitled to default bail.\nChaudhry relied upon certain replies received from the Deputy Registrar of High Court under the Right to Information Act which stated that Sessions Judges Vadane and Pande had not been appointed as special judges under the NIA Act. Instead, three other judges had been appointed as special judges by the Maharashtra government.\nMaharashtra government while opposing the plea stated that as long as the investigation was not assigned to NIA, the proceedings pertaining to the investigation could continue before the regular courts.\nAmong other grounds for opposing Bharadwaj's petition, NIA argued that there was a binding judgment of the Bombay High Court that NIA court comes into the picture only after the NIA takes over the investigation of a case.\nBoth the respondents argued that there was no prejudice caused to Bharadwaj even if the orders were allegedly passed by a court not having jurisdiction\nThe Bench reserved the verdict on August 4, 2021\nIn the other plea filed through advocate R Satyanarayanan, the accused had pointed out three notifications issued by the Maharashtra government which said that special court had been constituted for Pune city.\nAs per the notification, judge Pande had not been designated as special judge under NIA, it was contended.\nFrom the period of arrest till the date of taking cognizance of the chargesheet, several interlocutory applications were filed and all the applications were decided by the special judge.\nThe applications raising the issue of jurisdiction had never been decided, and the proceeding thus suffered from gross impropriety, it was submitted.\nMaharashtra government opposed the bail plea, making two fold submissions:\nThat the cognisance of the chargesheet by the court was not a relevant aspect while hearing a default bail application; the aspect that needed to be considered was whether the chargesheet had been filed on time or not. In the present case the chargesheet was filed within the extended time period granted by the Court.\nThat Section 16 of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) Act clearly used the words \"may take cognizance\" implying that the same was not mandatory.\nNIA adopted State’s submissions, and added that no other order except the order refusing default bail was challenged in the petition.\nThe Bench had reserved the verdict on September 1, 2021.\nThe Bhima Koregaon case stems from an event known as Elgar Parishad event organised on December 31, 2017, by a group of persons including activists and retired Supreme Court judge Justice PB Sawant and retired Bombay High Court judge Justice BG Kolse-Patil.\nThe event marked the 200th anniversary of the victory of Dalit soldiers in a battle against a local Brahmin Peshwa ruler.\nThe 2017 event was marred by violent clashes between Dalit and Maratha groups which led to at least one death and injuries to several others. Consequently, three First Information Reports (FIRs) were filed in the case.\nThe FIR of January 8, 2018 registered against Leftist groups with Maoist links was the one vigorously pursued by the authorities. It forms the basis of the entire Bhima Koregaon case which led to arrest of 16 accused and 3 chargesheets.\nThe trial in the case is yet to begin."}
{"ID": "id_26", "Summary": "The Calcutta High Court on Friday observed that Durga Puja is one of the most secular festivals and was not a purely religious one [Manab Jati Kalyan Foundation v. State of West Bengal].\nJustice Sabyasachi Bhattacharyya made the observation while ordering the authorities in Kolkata to permit an organisation to hold Durga Puja celebrations at a designated public ground in the city. \nThe Court refused to accept the argument of the authorities that the petitioners, under Article 25 of the Constitution, do not have any right to perform worship in public parks, roads, foot-paths, etc.\n\"As is public knowledge, the Durga Puja Festival is not confined merely to the worship or religious offerings component of the incarnation of feminine power but also a melting pot of different cultures...Hence, there is as much an element of ceremony, cultural programmes, festival and fanfare involved as religious worship. In such sense, the Durga Puja Festival is much more secular in nature than a pure religious performance of a particular community and cannot, thus, be narrowed down to being a mere 'religious offering' of a particular community,\" the judgment said.\nThe Bench was hearing a plea challenging the authorities' refusal to allow the petitioners to hold Durga Utsab 2023 in the New Town Mela Ground, which is used for the purpose of holding different fairs.\nThe authorities raised several objections, which, according to the petitioners, were flimsy pretexts to refuse permission to them. The petitioners relied on Article 14 of the Constitution of India, arguing that they have equal right as others to hold a Durga Puja festival on the said ground.\nAfter hearing arguments, the Bench observed that the primary distinguishing feature in the present case is that the site at which the Durga Puja Festival is sought to be held by the petitioners is not a street or a foot-path or even a playground, but a specifically designated ground for holding fairs.\n\"No intelligible or reasonable differentia has been made out by the authorities between a Durga Puja Festival and ordinary fairs or other festivals designated to be held on the Mela Ground. Both entail huge footfall and gathering of crowds including parking of vehicles of the people who come to visit,\" the Court opined.\nIt junked the argument that the Kolkata Police would be burdened if the Durga Puja is allowed at the site. It said such an argument is 'absolutely baseless' since it is a common feature in the entire State that there are numerous huge Durga Pujas organized by several entities quite close each other.\nThe Bench added that the mere fact that a person resides or has office elsewhere cannot be a deterrent for permitting him to organize a festival on public property specifically designated for holding public functions.\n\"Article 19 of the Constitution guarantees that all citizens have the right to assemble peacefully and without arms and to move freely throughout the territory of India. The specific purpose of such rights shall be frustrated if people are refused permission by public authorities on the ground of their residing elsewhere, unless there is a specific intelligible reason for such discrimination or a policy decision in that regard, also based on intelligible criteria,\" the Court said.\nIt was also noted that the petitioners had agreed to pay full charges, as sanctioned by law and procedure, for organising the said festival.\nAdvocates Tarunjyoti Tewari, Sandip Ray, Hiranmoy Debnath, Polly Banerjee and Paramita Dey appeared for the Petitioners.\nAdvocates Ratul Biswas and Chandan Kumar Mond represented the State."}

Muruganantham].\nIn the special leave petition (SLP) before the top Court, the DGP has argued that the High Court erred in transferring the probe to the CBI.\nThe plea also sought directions from the top court to expunge the remarks made by the High Court against the investigation conducted by the State Police.\nMadras High Court single-judge Justice GR Swaminathan had transferred the probe to CBI taking note that the investigation was not proceeding on the right lines, especially since a high ranking minister had taken a stand on the matter. Hence, the investigation cannot continue with the State Police.\n“The Superintendent of Police probably forgot the virtues of silence.. I fail to understand as to why the Thanjavur Superintendent of Police reacted as if she had come in contact with a live electric wire,” the High Court had said in its January 31 order.\nBy way of background, the deceased child Lavanya had consumed pesticide when she was in the school hostel. The judicial magistrate had recorded her dying declaration.\nIn her police statement on January 16 as well as in her statement before the judicial magistrate, the child directly and in unambiguous terms accused the hostel warden of burdening her with non-academic chores as a result of which, she consumed the pesticide.\nBased on her statements, the hostel warden was booked for offences under Sections 305, 511 of Indian Penal Code 1860 and Sections 75 and 82(1) of Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015.\nAt a later stage, a private video implicating the school’s correspondent began circulating on social media. When the same was brought to the notice of the Superintendent of Police, she told a reporter that in the preliminary enquiry, the religious conversion angle was not made out.\nThis led to the father of the deceased child losing faith in the investigation and thus, he moved the High Court.\nOn January 31, the High Court had noted in its order that the petitioner was justified in entertaining the impression of bias since by stating that the conversion angle stood ruled out, the SP had brushed aside the petitioner's complaint made in writing which was backed by the child’s video.\n\"This Court has a duty to render posthumous justice to the child. The foregoing circumstances cumulatively taken will definitely create an impression that the investigation is not proceeding on the right lines,\" the Court had observed.\nNoting that there was nothing “inherently improbable” in the allegation that there was an attempt at conversion, the single-judge had noted that the matter called for an investigation into the claim’s veracity, not an outright rejection."}

This it said was a clear violation of Section 13(1)(b) of the Income Tax Act, 1961.\nIt was also submitted by the appellant that the advertisement for educational scholarship was published by the Foundation in Urdu language and, that too, in one newspaper only. This, it was argued, clearly indicated that the Foundation wanted to restrict the circulation of the scholarship advertisement as its intent was to provide benefit to a particular religious community only.\nHowever, the High Court said that a perusal of the paper-book revealed that both the Commissioner Income Tax (Appeal) and tribunal had given a concurrent finding that the benefit of the scholarship to the poor and needy students was not confined to students of a particular community.\nThe Bench said that examination of the list submitted by the Hamdard Foundation also showed that the benefit of the scholarship had gone to students from all communities without any discrimination.\n“Moreover, just because advertisement was published in Urdu language and that too in one newspaper, it cannot be presumed that it was targeted at the students belonging to a particular community only. In fact, a similar finding of CIT(A) in the assessment year 2010-11 was accepted by the revenue and was not even challenged before the Tribunal,” the Court said. \nTherefore, the court dismissed the appeals noting that no substantial question of law arose in them.\nWhile Senior Standing Counsel Abhishek Maratha appeared for the commissioner of income tax, Hamdard Foundation was represented by Senior Advocate Salil Aggarwal along with advocates Madhur Aggarwal and Uma Shankar."}

If the circumstance of the case and the statement of the witnesses inspires the Court to come to a conclusion that the accused was driving the vehicle in a drunken state, in the absence of a statutory mandate for a medical report, the absence of such a report by itself need not deter the court from arriving at such a conclusion. Needless to observe, these are all matters for trial,\" the High Court said. \n“Rash or negligent driving on a public road with the knowledge of the dangerous character of his act, especially when he drives in an inebriated state, can fall in the category of culpable homicide, not amounting to murder, if the injured died as a result of the injuries,” the Court added.\nThe Court passed the order on two pleas challenging the order of the Session Court discharging IAS officer Sriram Venkitaraman in a case of culpable homicide after the car he was driving rammed into journalist KM Basheer, killing him.\nThe police allegedly found Venkitaraman in an inebriated state after the accident. However, there was a significant delay in collecting his blood sample for testing the alcohol level as Venkitaraman had managed to check himself out of the government hospital where the police had taken him.\nSubsequently, a case was registered against Venkitaraman as well as Wafa Firoz who was in the car along with Venkitaraman at the time.\nIn October 2022, the Additional District and Sessions Judge -I, Thiruvananthapuram discharged Venkitaraman and Firoz of the offenses under Section 304, 201 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), Section 185 of the Motor Vehicles Act (MV Act), and Section 3(1)(2) of the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act.\nHowever, the Session court framed charges against Venkitaraman under Sections 279 (rash driving) and 304(A) (causing death by negligence) of the IPC and Section 184 (drunk driving) Of MV Act and Firoz of sections 188 (abetment) and 184 of the IPC.\nThis prompted the present two pleas challenging the Session Court order.\nOne was moved by the State government challenging the Sessions Court order and the other was moved by Wafa Firoz challenging the decision of the Session Court framing charges against her.\nOn Thursday, the High Court set aside the part of the order of the Sessions Court discharging Venkitaraman of culpable homicide charge taking note of the fact, that he didn’t do the medical test on time, which cannot be ignored.\n“The contention that there has been an apparent attempt on the part of the first accused to wriggle out of a timely medical test cannot be wholly ignored. After being referred to the Medical College Hospital, the first accused could not have gone to a private hospital, contrary to the reference, unless he wanted to cause the disappearance of the evidence of the alleged offense,” the court noted.\nBased on the various aspects of the case, the High Court set aside that portion of the Sessions Court order that had discharged Venkitaraman of the charges under Sections 304 and 201(causing the disappearance of evidence of the commission of the offense of IPC.\nHowever, the court upheld the portion of the order that had discharged him for the offences punishable under Section 184, 185 (Drunk dangerously) of the Motor Vehicle Act (MV Act) and 3(1)(2) of the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act (PDPP Act).\nThe Court discharged Venkitaraman from sections 184 and 185 of the MV Act as medical test was not conducted and there was no evidence to reveal the existence of alcohol content in the blood.\nThe Court also discharged him from the offense under section 3(2) of the PDPP Act as the same requires mischief in respect of public property as its main ingredient.\nThe revision petition filed by Firoz was allowed and she was discharged for the offense under section 188 of the MV Act on abetment since none of the materials revealed that she permitted Venkitaraman to drive the car.\nThe State Government was represented by Public Prosecutor SU Nazar.\nSreeram Venkittaraman was represented by advocates S Rajeev S, V Vinay, MS Aneer, Sarath KP, and Prerith Philip Joseph.\nWafa Firoz was represented by advocates G Ranju Mohan, S Suresh, M Shanti and Arya S."}

Rather it was a clash between two semi-armed groups, particularly since both sides sustained injuries, the High Court concluded.\nThe High Court verdict was challenged before the Supreme Court by the Rajasthan government as well as the complainant. \nThe top court found that the High Court had magnified 'simple, doubtful and totally unexplained injuries' of the accused to conclude that both sides had been injured. By doing so, the Supreme Court opined that the High Court had \"belittled the brutal and murderous attack\" by the accused on the victims, one of whom had died. \n\"This approach of the High Court in our considered opinion was not correct.

It cannot be assumed that every member of the unlawful assembly could be found guilty of the offence of Section 302 of the IPC and, therefore, every decision on an application of bail must be based on a careful consideration of the facts and circumstances in the matter therein,” the Court held.\nWhile accused Ravi Kumar and Arun Kumar were released on bail, Vishal Singh’s application has been denied.\nAll of them were charged with murder, unlawful assembly and Section 149 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) among several other offences.\nIt was alleged that they were part of a mob of around 100 people that gathered in Bhajanpura area chanting slogans of ‘Jai Shree Ram’. The crowd then entered the house where Akbari Begum lived, opening the locks and setting it on fire. The family members saved their lives by rushing to the top floor. However, Begum could not reach the roof top because of her age and died of asphyxiation.\nIt was also alleged that the mob plundered the house and looted ₹8 lakh along with gold and silver jewellery and several valuable items.\nJustice Prasad noted that the video footage did not show Ravi as actively taking part in the activity of the mob and he looked like a curious onlooker therefore the material against him does not justify continued incarceration.\nIn case of Arun Kumar, the Court said that the atmosphere where the incident took place was charged and he was a resident of the locality therefore it cannot be said with certainty that his presence on the spot with lathi was enough to conclude that he was an active member of the unlawful assembly.\nHowever, in Vishal Singh’s case, Justice Prasad said that material on record clearly revealed that he was an active member of the mob that set Akbari Begum’s house on fire. The judge noted that there was clinching evidence against him and he was dragging a scooty at the scene of the crime where he is clearly identified.\n“This Court is of the opinion that the footage of the Petitioner at the Scene of Crime is quite egregious, and is therefore sufficient to keep the Petitioner in custody.

{"ID": "id_284", "Summary": "The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the striking down of a law enacted by the Tamil Nadu government providing 10.5 percent reservation in educational institutions and government jobs to persons from the Vanniyar caste [Pattali Makkal Katchi v. A Mayilerumperumal And Ors].\nA Bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao and BR Gavai was hearing a plea filed by the State of Tamil Nadu challenging a Madras High Court judgment which struck down the law. It held,\n\"We are of the opinion that there is no basis to treat Vanniyar as a separate group compared to others. Thus, the 2021 Act is ultra vires Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution.\"\nThe Court further held,\n\"State cannot be restricted to implement internal reservation on the issue of Presidential assent. Caste can be the basis of internal reservation, but it cannot be the sole basis.\"\nThe law under challenge, the Tamil Nadu Special Reservation of seats in educational Institutions including Private Educational Institutions and appointments or posts in the services under the State within the Reservation for the Most Backward Classes and Denotified Communities Act, 2021, provided an internal reservation of 10.5 percent for the Vanniyar community within the 20 per cent quota for all Most Backward Classes (MBCs) and Denotified Communities (DNCs).\nThe special law was purportedly brought to meet the demand of Vanniyars, a caste of MBC, based on claims that they are a numerically predominant community but were unable to compete with the other communities in the MBC/DNC category.\nA Division Bench of the Madras High Court had, however, ruled on November 1 that the law was passed without any quantifiable data on the socio-educational status of the Vanniyars in the services and that there was no objective criteria for sub-classifying them.\n\"The enactment has been passed by the State without any quantifiable data on population, socio-educational status and representation of the backward classes in the services and the sub-classification done by virtue of the impugned Act solely based on population data, in the absence of any objective criteria, is illegal in the eye of law and in violation of the Constitution of India,” the High Court had said.\nIt had also noted that if the Vanniyar caste is given 10.5 percent reservation out of the 20 percent earmarked for MBCs, the remaining 115 MBCs will get only a 9.5 percent share.\nThe law was introduced during the rule of the All India Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) in 2021. It was passed in the legislative assembly in February last year.\nAfter the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) party was elected to form the next government following the Assembly elections last April, a Government Order (GO) was also passed in July by the DMK regime to implement the Vanniyar reservation retrospectively from February 26, 2021.\nAt least 35 writ petitions were filed before the Madras High Court by persons belonging to other MBCs, challenging the Act and the decision of the State government to give preference Vanniyar community by sub-classifying them.\nThe petitioners contended that after the insertion of the 102nd amendment to the Constitution of India, the State government has no power to identify/classify any community as backward and it is the sole domain of Parliament. Hence, the Act was argued to be in violation of Articles 338-B and 342-A of the Constitution of India.\nFurther, the appropriate authority to notify a caste will be the National Commission for Backward Classes, which is a Constitutional body under Article 333-B. Article 340 of the Constitution of India specifically provided that the President may, by order, appoint a Commission consisting of such persons as he thinks fit to investigate the conditions of socially and educationally backward classes and the difficulties under which they work and make recommendations as to the steps that should be taken by the Union or any State to remove such difficulties.\nHowever, the State government, without waiting for the recommendations of the Commission, passed the Act without consultation with all the stakeholders, especially, those communities who would be affected by the Act, the petitioners argued.\nBesides, it was contended that the State of Tamil Nadu granted internal reservation of 10.5 percent out of 20 percent for the Vanniyar community alone. This is over 50 percent earmarked for MBC. In addition, the classification made on a particular premise of offering a larger slot to Vanniyars in MBC, is bad. There cannot be a preferential treatment from among the same class, it was submitted.\nFurther, the petitions argued that without there being any census, the Government of Tamil passed a Bill granting 10.5 per cent reservation to the Vanniyar community under MBC without considering caste-wise population and there is no data available with the State government to invoke the enabling provisions in the Constitution to provide internal reservation.\nRead more about Madras High Court judgment here."}

The fact that there was no medico-legal case report, post-mortem report or death certificate created suspicion that there was an attempt to suppress the entire incident.\nIt was alleged that on April 4, the victim was invited to Goalain’s birthday party where she was gangraped by him and 4-5 other friends. She was sent back to her home at around 8PM sick, unable to stand up, bleeding from her private parts and smelling of alcohol. Soon after her mother returned from the local doctor, the daughter was found dead on the bed.\nThe petitioners alleged that the family was prevented from taking the victim to a private or government hospital, and resultantly, the girl died on account of excessive bleeding from her private parts.\nIt was also their submission that the family was threatened and the police refused to register a report on the next day. Only after the intervention of a local NGO was a First Information Report (FIR) registered by the police after five days.\nIt was the petitioner’s concern that the investigation was not being conducted adequately since the father of the accused is a TMC leader. They stated that even the highest executive of the State was calling it an incident resulting from a love affair. Therefore, people did not have faith in the State’s police machinery to carry out a fair investigation.\nThe State submitted a case diary to the Court and stated that the police authorities were properly investigating the matter. The Court was informed that an arrest was made and statements of the concerned people under Section 164 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) had been recorded.\nThe Court relied on its decision in the case of The Court on its own Motion In re: The Brutal Incident of Bogtui Village, Rampurhat, Birbhum wherein it considered the circumstances and scope of handing over the investigation to an independent agency like the CBI.\nIt was noted that to have a fair investigation in the matter and to instil confidence in the family members of the victim, the residents of the locality and the State, the probe must be carried out by the CBI instead of the local police.\nThe CBI was directed to furnish a report describing the progress of investigation by May 2.

{"ID": "id_292", "Summary": "The Supreme Court today referred to a larger Bench a batch of petitions challenging the Maharashtra State Reservation for Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) Act, which provides for reservation in employment and education to the Maratha community.\nThe Bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao, Hemant Gupta and S Ravindra Bhat has held that in the meanwhile, there will be no such reservation in jobs and admissions.\nThe Court has further ruled that admissions to postgraduate courses will not be altered. The matter will now be placed for Chief Justice of India, SA Bobde, who will constitute a larger bench. The judgment says:\nAs the interpretation of the provisions inserted by the Constitution (102nd Amendment) Act, 2018 is a substantial question of law as to the interpretation of the Constitution of India, these Appeals are referred to a larger Bench. These matters shall be placed before Hon’ble The Chief Justice of India for suitable orders.\nAdmissions to educational institutions for the academic year 2020-21 shall be made without reference to the reservations provided in the Act. We make it clear that the Admissions made to PostGraduate Medical Courses shall not be altered.\nAppointments to public services and posts under the Government shall be made without implementing the reservation as provided in the Act.\nThe Court was considering an appeal against the decision of the Maharashtra High Court which had upheld the Maratha Reservations in education and employment where the High Court had allowed for the breaching of the upper ceiling of 50% reservation that was laid down in the Indra Sawhney judgment.\nThe Bench had heard the parties on the question of reference of the matter to an 11-Judge Constitution Bench on the issue of 50% cap on reservations, a point of contention that emerged from this case.\nSenior Advocates Mukul Rohatgi, representing the State of Maharashtra, and Senior Advocate Kapil Sibal, representing an applicant, urged the Court to refer the issue of the 50% ceiling on reservation to a larger Bench. \nThe SEBC Act provides for reservation for the Maratha community in the State of Maharashtra. The decision of the Bombay High Court upholding the law with modifications was challenged before the Supreme Court. One of primary grounds for challenge was that this law, if implemented, would breach the 50% upper ceiling put in place for reservations.\nWith the change in demographics of society, there is a need for the upper ceiling to be revised, the Senior Counsel in support of the SEBC Act had argued. It was further argued that this case needed to be examined by a Bench of 11 Judges, considering that the judgment delivered in the Indra Sawhney case was delivered by a 9-Judge Bench.\nCounsel in favour of making the reference to a Constitution Bench had argued that after the 103rd amendment providing for the EWS reservation, the ceiling fixed at 50% was breached in almost all states.\nIt was pointed out to the Court that in the Janhit Abhiyan case, the challenge to the Constitutional amendment providing for EWS reservation has been referred to a Constitution Bench. Therefore, a statutory enactment like SEBC Act also should be similarly referred.\nOn the other hand, Senior Counsel like Arvind Datar and Gopal Sankarnarayanan who opposed the reference, argued that if the Court decides on the SLP filed and concludes that the Maratha community is not socially and educationally backward and as such not eligible for the reservation in the first place, the question of breaching 50% is rendered void and the matter may not be needed to be referred at all.\nIt was urged by these lawyers that the matter be heard on merits and if during the hearing the Court is of the opinion that a reference is needed, the same can be done at that later stage.\nWhile referring the case to a larger Bench, the Court observed that the upper limit of 50% for reservation is fixed as a rule of law and it is evident that the same is allowed to be relaxed only in extraordinary cases. The equality guaranteed under Article 16(1) has to be balanced against the reservation provided for under Article 16(4) where the 50% cap also comes into play.\nThe judgment explains,\nIn view of this law, the Court remarked that the givernment of Maharashtra had failed to prove the extraordinary circumstances owing to which the upper cap would be needed to be relaxed for extending reservation benefit to the Maratha Community. \nThe Court also noted that this community which comprises almost 30% of the population of the State of Maharashtra cannot be termed as a marginalized community living in far-flung areas.\nObserving that the Bombay High Court committed an error is allowing for relaxation of the rule the Supreme Court said that,\nAs such, the Court referred the matter to a larger Bench with these observations and prima facie view. \nMoreover, the Court noted that cancellation of admissions and employments given under the quota would be difficult and the implementation of the Act would cause irreparable damage and that is why the Court has effectively stayed the implementation of the Act going forward while directing that the admissions already given shall not be altered.\nRead Judgment:"}

Any punishment less than the imprisonment for life for the offence punishable under Section 302 would be contrary to Section 302 IPC,\" the Court said. \nThe top court was hearing an appeal against a 2019 order of the Madhya Pradesh High Court which confirmed a 1995 trial court conviction for murder but reduced the punishment. \nThe High Court had given the accused the benefit of the right to private defence, and reduced the sentence to the period already undergone behind bars, which at the time was seven years and ten months. \nThe State then moved the present appeal.\nDeputy Advocate General Ankita Chaudhary submitted that the order under challenge was erroneous and contrary to Section 302 (punishment for murder) of the IPC. \nThe Court accepted the same, noting that the High Court had specifically maintained the conviction of the accused for murder but reduced the sentence to period already undergone. \nThis, the top court said, was contrary to Section 302 and unsustainable.\nThe Court, therefore, set aside the High Court verdict with respect to sentence and restored the punishment of life imprisonment handed down by the trial court."}

The Court also refused to accept the argument that there may be a chance of public tranquility being disturbed since the rally was sought to be held on a public holiday. \nThe Court added that the public holiday on Republic Day has mostly been peaceful in West Bengal till date.\n\"People are generally in a joyous and happy mood (during Republic Day).

The Committee will not punish you or pass any orders. It will submit a report to us,\" he said.\nThe committee is being formed so that the Court gets a clearer picture about the ground situation, CJI Bobde added while underscoring that the committee and its functioning will be considered part of the current judicial proceedings before the Supreme Court. \nSenior Counsel Harish Salve told that if the laws are stayed, then the order should make it clear that its not a victory for anyone.\nA detailed copy of order is expected to be published on the Supreme Court website later today. \nInterestingly, Attorney General KK Venugopal told the Court during the hearing on Tuesday that the Central government has received information that Khalistanis have infiltrated the farmers protests.\nThis submission was made after the Court inquired from Venugopal about whether or not he can confirm an allegation made in an application filed by one of the intervenors that a banned organisation is trying to fund the protests.\n\"Mr Attorney an allegation has been made against a banned organisation that it is trying to fund the protest.. can you confirm or deny this?\", CJI Bobde asked. \n\"We have said that Khalistanis have infiltrated the protests,\" responded Venugopal while stating that Centre will place arguments to that effect on affidavit.\nVenugopal submitted that there was no opposition the laws in States like Kerala and Karnataka. \nHe also pointed out that a tractor rally is being planned to be held on Republic Day which needs to be stopped and the Delhi police has filed an application before the Supreme Court to injunct the rally.\n\"Once they are allowed in the city, we don't know where all they will they be going and which all place they will go to agitate,\" Venugopal contended. \nThe Court issued notice on that application and posted it for hearing on January 18.\nThe Court had during the hearing of the matter on Monday, expressed its inclination to stay the contentious laws while observing that the steps taken by the Central government to break the deadlock between the government and farmers have not yielded the desired results. \nVarious farmers unions and organisations and individuals have assailed the three Farm Laws before the Supreme Court. \nThe three laws, Farmers (Empowerment & Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance & Farm Services Act 2020, Farmers Produce Trade & Commerce (Promotion & Facilitation) Act & Amendment to Essential Commodities Act have been challenged as illegal, arbitrary and unconstitutional.\n\"They will pave the way for cartelization and commercialization of agriculture produced and if allowed to stand will completely ruin our country as the corporates can, with one stroke, export our agriculture produce without any regulation,\" one of the petitioners submitted.\nIt was also contended that the laws passed are \"unconstitutional\" and \"anti-farmer,\" as it would dismantle the Agriculture Produce Market Committee system intended to ensure fair prices for farm products.\nThe Central government has remained steadfast in its stance that the laws are perfectly Constitutional and within the legislative competence of the Parliament. \nIn its affidavit filed before the top court on Monday, the Central government claimed that the Farm Laws are a result of two decades of deliberation and that \"wrong perception created by non-farmer elements\" about the laws needs to be cleared.\nIt alleged that some of the farmers were agitating against the Laws due to the \"apprehensions, misgivings and misconceptions created by some vested interest people\".\n\"(Most of) the farmers of the nation are happy as they are given an additional option over and above the existing and, therefore, no vested right is taken away,\" the affidavit said."}
{"ID": "id_296", "Summary": "The Kerala High Court on Monday upheld the condition mandating that applicants to the post of Assistant Law Officer at National Thermal Power Corporation Limited (NTPC) should have cleared the Common Law Admission Test (CLAT).\nA division bench of Justices AK Jayasankaran Nambiar and Mohammed Nias CP overturned a judgment of a single-judge who had struck down the condition. \nThe bench held that the present selection criterion was not violative of the right to equality before the law guaranteed by Article 14 of the Constitution of India. \n\"The basic principle underlying Article 14 is only to ensure that law must operate equally on all persons under the like circumstances and a discretionary power conferred on the employer to fix the eligibility standards or qualification cannot be held to be discriminatory. Guarantee for equality cannot imply that qualifications should be prescribed to make every one eligible without conceding the right to the employer to choose what he considers as the best qualification given the nature of the job to be undertaken,\" the Court said in its judgment.\nIt further held that the criterion cannot be struck down on presumption of violation of Article 16 which guarantees equality of opportunity to all citizens. \n\"Article 16 only speaks of equality of opportunity and not opportunity to achieve equality and is also different from equality of the results. We have to concede the power of the State to frame rules of classification to secure the standard of efficiency they aspire for and classifications always need not be arithmetically exact or to suit the majority. We have no doubt that the selection process in the instant case does not suffer from the vice of discrimination or arbitrariness and we uphold the selection process,\" the bench held.\nThe question before the Court was whether, after having secured an LLB degree from any recognised Indian university with 60 per cent marks as qualification, the eligibility can be restricted to candidates who have appeared for CLAT-2021 post-graduation programme and whether its score can be made the basis for selection.\nThe order of the single judge, which was challenged, came in a petition moved by a postgraduate student who is currently pursuing her LL.M. at the Cochin University of Science and Technology (CUSAT). The University is not a part of the Consortium of National Law Universities, meaning that she never had to appear for CLAT-PG.\nA notification calling for applicants to the post of Assistant Law Officer was issued by the NTPC. The petitioner claimed that she has the notified qualification of 60 per cent marks in LL.B. and registration with the Bar Council.\nHowever, the selection process was confined to candidates who have appeared for CLAT PG 2021.\nThe single-judge had held that the notification issued by NTPC was discriminatory and that the inclusion of CLAT clearance as a criterion did not have any rational nexus to the object sought to be achieved.\nHowever, rather than upsetting the whole selection process, the Court had deemed it fit to direct the NTPC to accept the petitioner's application and conduct a selection test or interview for testing her eligibility for appointment as Assistant Law Officer.\nThe NTPC challenged the same before division bench.\nSolicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the appellant NTPC submitted that the additional criteria of qualifying CLAT was incorporated because it was found to be the most suitable method for assessing the skill set required of candidates.\nHe further contended it is the prerogative of the employer to fix eligibility criteria and there is limited scope for judicial interference in such matters.\nHe further pointed out that conducting a separate nationwide examination for recruitment to 10-15 vacancies would not be feasible.\nOn the other hand, advocate Maitreyi S Hegde, appearing for the writ petitioner, argued that the CLAT clearance criteria thwarts the chances of a majority of aspirants out of the 1,721 law colleges in India, only 23 are members of the Consortium of National Law Universities.\nTherefore, imposition of said criterion amounts to indirect discrimination, she contended.\nAfter hearing the matter at length, the division bench had while reserving its judgment opined that prima facie there seems to be no illegality in the selection criteria adopted by the NTPC.\nSolicitor General Tushar Mehta was assisted by advocates Adarsh Tripathi, Vikram Singh and Ajitesh Garg."}
{"ID": "id_297", "Summary": "The Bombay High Court quashed the order of a civil court which had disallowed a divorced woman from adopt a child on the ground that she was a \"working lady\" and thus won't be able to give proper care and attention to the adoptive child [Shabnamjahan Moinuddin Ansari vs State of Maharashtra].\nSingle-judge Justice Gauri Godse said the reasoning given by the civil court at Bhusawal indicated \"medieval mindset\" against a working woman.\n\"The comparison done by the competent court between the biological mother being a housewife and the prospective adoptive mother (single parent) being a working lady reflects a mindset of the medieval conservative concepts of a family,\" the bench observed in the order passed on Tuesday. \nThe High Court underscored that when the statute recognises a single parent to be eligible for being an adoptive parent, the approach of the civil court defeats the very object of the statute.\n\"Generally, a single parent is bound to be a working person, maybe with some rare exceptions. Thus, by no stretch of the imagination, a single parent can be held to be ineligible to be an adoptive parent on the ground that he/she is a working person,\" the judge held. \nThe Court was seized of a civil revision application filed by a Madhya Pradesh based woman, who sought permission to adopt the minor child, who biological parents lived in Maharashtra's Jalgaon.\nAs per the plea, the woman complied with the statutory requirements under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act (JJ Act) and also the Adoption Regulations, 2022. \nHowever, on an application for adoption, the civil court in Bhusawal rejected her plea and disallowed her from adopting the child. It noted that the biological mother of the child was an housewife and thus could take better care of the child while the adoptive single mother was a working woman and would not be able to give personal attention. \nIn its order, the judge noted that section 57 of the JJ Act provides the eligibility criteria of a prospective parent, which holds a single or divorced person eligible for taking a child in adoption. The section mandates that the prospective adoptive parent shall be physically fit, financially sound, mentally alert and highly motivated to adopt a child to provide a good upbringing to the child. \n\"Thus, the reason given by the civil court is not only contrary to the provisions of the JJ Act but is also contrary to the recommendation made by the District Child Welfare Officer and the Assistant Director of CARA. Even otherwise, the reason given by the civil court is unfounded and baseless,\" Justice Godse opined. \nThe civil court, Justice Godse said, was required to verify whether the statutory requirements were complied with and form an opinion as to whether the application for adoption was in the interest of the child. \nIt has erroneously rejected the application by doing guesswork, the court said. \nJustice Godse further said that there was nothing adverse against the adoptive single parent and in fact she had complied with the mandatory norms and even the report of the District Child Welfare Officer held her to be a fit parent for adopting the child. \n\"The impugned order does not record anything adverse regarding the statutory compliances. The  application is rejected only on one ground of the adoptive parent being a working lady. The reason recorded by the civil court is unfounded, illegal, perverse, unjust and unacceptable,\" the Court held. \nTherefore, the Court quashed the order and paved way for the woman to adopt the child. \nAdvocates NS Shah, SS Patil appeared for the Applicant. \nAdditional Government Pleader SB Pulkundwar represented the State."}

It is surprising that such a heinous crime, which affects the entire society and the relation between ‘Guru’ and ‘Disciples’ should be viewed very strictly,\" the judge underscored.\nThe judge invoked the well-known shloka - 'Guru Brahma Gurur Vishnu Guru Devo Maheshwaraha Guru Saakshat Para Brahma Tasmai Sree Gurave Namaha'. \nThis would mean Guru is verily the representative of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva and he creates, sustains knowledge and destroys the weeds of ignorance, the bench explained.\nThe Court said that children being the future of our nation, need special protection from such offences. \n\"The hope of tomorrow rests on the children. But unfortunately, in our country, a girl child is in a very vulnerable position. There are different modes of her exploitation, including sexual assault and/or sexual abuse. The exploitation of children in such a manner is a crime against humanity and the society. Therefore, the children and more particularly the girl child deserve full protection and need greater care and protection whether in the urban or rural areas,\" Justice Dave observed in his order passed on November 30.\nIn such cases, responsibility on the shoulders of courts to provide proper legal protection to these children is more onerous, the Court opined.\nA minor who is subjected to sexual abuse, the Court said, needs to be protected even more than a major victim.\n\"A major victim being an adult may still be able to withstand the social rationalization and mental harassment meted out by society, but a minor victim will find it difficult to do so. Most crimes against minor victims are not even reported as very often, the perpetrator of the crime is a member of the family of the victim or a close friend. Therefore, the child needs extra protection,\" the judge observed.\nIn the present case, the single-judge noted that the accused was not a layperson but a teacher, which is the only career that influences other professions. \n\"It has the power to influence young people’s future for the benefit of future generations. The teacher is expected to act a protector. Such heinous acts by the accused would cast a lifelong psychological and emotional impact on the victim. Crimes like this by a person of trust, change the perception of a child to look forward towards life in a positive way. Therefore, the accused deserves no leniency,\" the Court underscored.\nThe victim was barely a 12 years old and the teacher instead of showing fatherly love and protection to the child, made her a victim of his lust. \n\"It is a case where trust has been betrayed and social values are impaired. Therefore, the accused as such does not deserve any sympathy and/or any leniency,\" the Court observed.\nIt further referred to the statement of objects and reasons of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act and said even the Articles 15 and 39 of the Constitution of India, provide protection of children from the offences of sexual assault and sexual harassment. \n\"Any act of sexual assault or sexual harassment to the children should be viewed very seriously and all such offences of sexual assault, sexual harassment on the children have to be dealt with in a stringent manner and no leniency should be shown to a person who has committed the offence under the POCSO Act,\" the Court said.\nBy awarding a suitable punishment commensurate with the act of sexual assault, the court said that a message must be conveyed to the society at large that, if anybody commits any offence under the POCSO Act of sexual assault, sexual harassment or use of children for pornographic purposes they shall be punished suitably and no leniency shall be shown to them. \n\"Cases of sexual assault or sexual harassment on the children are instances of perverse lust for sex where even innocent children are not spared in pursuit of such debased sexual pleasure,\" the bench observed.\nWith these observations, the bench dismissed the bail plea.\nAdvocate AJ Yagnik appeared for the accused.\nAdvocate Param R Buch appeared for the complainant.\nAdditional Public Prosecutor CM Shah represented the State."}
{"ID": "id_302", "Summary": "In a recent judgment, the Supreme Court of India has thrown light on the factors/ circumstances from which the intention of an accused to cause death of someone can be gathered, in order to determine whether an offence of murder under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) is made out [State of Uttarakhand v. Sachendra Singh Rawat].\nA Division Bench of Justices MR Shah and BV Nagarathna relied upon the top court's 2006 judgment in Pulicherla Nagaraju v. State of Andhra Pradesh wherein the Court had held that the intention to cause death can be gathered generally from a combination of the following, among other, circumstances:\nnature of the weapon used;\nwhether the weapon was carried by the accused or was picked up from the spot;\nwhether the blow is aimed at a vital part of the body;\nthe amount of force employed in causing injury;\nwhether the act was in the course of sudden quarrel or sudden fight or free for all fight;\nwhether the incident occurs by chance or whether there was any premeditation;\nwhether there was any prior enmity or whether the deceased was a stranger;\nwhether there was any grave and sudden provocation, and if so, the cause for such provocation;\nwhether it was in the heat of passion;\nwhether the person inflicting the injury has taken undue advantage or has acted in a cruel and unusual manner;\nwhether the accused dealt a single blow or several blows.\nThe top court was adjudicating an appeal moved by the State, assailing an order of the Uttarakhand High Court which had reduced the sentence of a murder convict from life imprisonment to ten years rigorous imprisonment.\nBackground\nOn November 26, 2014, the respondent-accused and the deceased one Virendra Singh were attending a wedding ceremony, when some altercations took place between the two, but the same was brought to control by people present there.\nLater in the night, the respondent-accused attacked Singh using a danda and he sustained multiple injuries on his head with a skull fracture and frontal lobe wound on the left side.\nHe later succumbed to injuries on December 5, 2014.\nUpon the registration of a first information report (FIR) by the wife of the deceased, a chargesheet against the accused for the offence of murder was framed. \nThe trial court relied upon eye witness testimony to convict the accused for murder and sentence him to life imprisonment.\nAggrieved, the accused approached the High Court, which reduced the sentence awarded to the accused and held that the instant case is of culpable homicide not amounting to murder.\nThis was on the ground that it was not a cold-blooded murder but a sudden fight that ensued in the heat of passion between the accused and the deceased.\nThe High Court held that the accused did not have any intention to kill and/or commit the murder of the deceased and therefore, the case would fall under the fourth exception to Section 300 IPC (murder).\nConsequently, the High Court reduced the sentence of the accused.\nAggrieved, the State moved the present appeal before the Supreme Court.\nFindings of the Supreme Court\nThe Supreme Court observed that the High Court had erred in ordering that the case would fall under the fourth exception to Section 300 IPC i.e. not murder but culpable homicide not amounting to murder.\nThe Court noted that the second incident when the accused had attacked the deceased with a danda, with the deceased running towards his house for the safety of his life but was left unconscious by the accused, cannot be said to be a result of a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel.\n\"The second incident had taken place near the house of the deceased and that too after the first incident was over, everybody went to their houses and thereafter at 12:00 in the mid night the second incident had taken place in which the accused gave several blows to the deceased by “Phakadiyat” on the head, thigh etc. Therefore, the High Court has erred in observing that the case would fall under Fourth exception to Section 300 IPC,\" the Supreme Court observed.\nThe top court then highlighted that the High Court had failed to take into consideration the grievous injuries caused to the deceased. It was observed by the Bench that the use of a danda by the accused with tremendous force clearly projected that the act of the accused cannot come under any exception provided in Section 300 of the IPC.\nThe top court, therefore, held that the order passed by the High Court is unsustainable, both on facts as well as on law and restored the conviction and life sentence for murder \nAdvocate Virendra Rawat argued for the appellant.\nAdvocate Neha Sharma argued for the respondent."}

Added, the alarming rate of climate change is caused due to the unsustainable and environmentally harmful patterns of life, sustainability in this regard must now more than ever before factor into decision making,\" the judgement stated.\nThe Court was seized of a batch of petitions filed by retailers and wholesalers engaged in selling firecrackers across Bangalore challenging orders of the Commissioner of Police, Bangalore and the Director General and Inspector of Police, passed in 2013 imposing a blanket ban on the sale of such items in congested areas or markets in the city.\nThe petitioners had challenged the orders claiming that their right to carry on a business as provided under Article 19 the Constitution of India would be violated by such orders.\nThe Court, however, referred to the judgment of the Supreme Court in Arjun Gopal vs Union of India in which the top court had held that the right to health and environment as envisaged under Article 21 will have to be given importance over the provisions of freedom of religion Article 25.\n\"Even otherwise, in matters like this, the doctrine of equality enshrined in Article 14 cannot be readily pressed into service, unmindful of enormous hazards that would possibly put the public at large to, should a section of traders be permitted to continue their firecracker business in the areas in question. The interest of the public would be more served by petitioners and other traders shifting their said business to safer areas than being permitted to continue in the same areas in question,\" the judge said while dismissing the argument that vendors selling other products aren't asked to move.\nJustice Dixit the invoked Brihadaranyak Upanishad \"Sarve Bhavantu Sukhinaha; Sarve Santu Niraamayah..\"\n\"It nearly translates to: let all people be happy and all creatures be free from affliction,\" the judge explained, further adding that it is high time that the civil society accelerates its positive response to the \"inner voice\" of apex court of country against the use of firecrackers. \nThe Court also took note of the reasoning provided by the authorities that any fire mishap arising from the crackers and fireworks cannot be easily handled since it is difficult for fire engines to move through narrow lanes in thickly populated areas.\n\"The interest of the public would be more served by petitioners and other traders shifting their businesses to safer areas than from being permitted to continue in the same areas in question\", the Court said in its judgment dismissing the petitions and upholding the ban.\nSenior Advocate Pramila Nesargi assisted by advocate Bindu U appeared for the petitioners.\nAdvocates Timmanna Bhat Devathe and B V Krishna represented the state authorities."}
{"ID": "id_306", "Summary": "The Patna High Court recently quashed the criminal proceedings initiated against Congress leader and former India cricketer Navjot Singh Sidhu for allegedly appealing for votes on religious grounds during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections [Navjot Singh Sidhu v The State of Bihar & Anr].\nJustice Sandeep Kumar concluded that Sidhu had only said that All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) Chief Asaduddin Owaisi was trying to divide Muslim votes.\nSidhu had not made any statement prejudicial to the maintenance of harmony or said something that was likely to disturb the public tranquility, the Court found. \n“From the content of the speech, it does not appear that the petitioner has tried to promote feelings of enmity or hatred between two classes of people or two religions but in fact he has only said that Mr. Owaisi was trying to divide the votes of Muslim,” the Court opined.\nThe Court added that Sidhu’s statement did not depict any communal tension or violence but only cautioned the Muslim community about dividing their votes at the behest of Owaisi.\nIn this backdrop, the Court rejected the allegation that Sidhu had demanded votes in the name of religion. \nThe case related to comments made by Sidhu in April 2019 during election campaigns. Sidhu is reported to have appealed to Muslim voters to vote for the Congress en bloc in order to defeat the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) during the 2019 general elections and not split their votes by voting for Owaisi. \nA First Information Report (FIR) was registered for these comments on April 16, 2019 against Sidhu by the Bihar Police under provisions of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Representation of People Act (RP Act). \nSubsequently, a charge sheet was filed and the trial court took cognizance of the offences alleged against Sidhu.\nSidhu challenged these proceedings before the High Court and contended that he was falsely implicated in the case only due to political rivalry. \nHowever, the State argued that since a prima facie case was made out against him, the prosecution cannot be quashed at the stage of cognizance.\nConcluding no appeal on religious grounds had been made by Sidhu, the High Court held that he cannot be prosecuted under Section 123(3) of the RP Act. \nOn the charge under Section 125 of RP Act on promoting religious hatred in connection with elections, the Court said:\n“In the opinion of this Court, the ingredients of Section 125 of the Representation of the People Act are not made out against the petitioner as the statements have not been made to promote or attempting to promote on grounds of religions, race, caste, community or language, feelings of enmity or hatred between different classes of citizens of India.”\nRegarding the allegation that Sidhu had violated Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the IPC by flouting restraining orders while making an appeal for votes on religious grounds, the Court noted that Section 195 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) restricts a Magistrate from accepting a written complaint from any person, other than the public servant who issued the order or someone superior to him. \nIt found that the informant, an Assistant Engineer of Rural Works Department, was not and did not even claim to be the Public Servant who lawfully promulgated the order. \nIt further noted that he is not even an officer administratively superior to the concerned public servant.\n“The provisions of Section 195 of the CrPC are mandatory and the non-compliance of these provisions would vitiate the prosecution and all other consequential orders/ proceedings. Since the complaint has been filed against the mandatory provision of Section 195(1) CrPC, all subsequent action shall be held to be illegal i.e., the investigation and the cognizance pursuant to the registration of the FIR,” the Court said.\nThe Court also opined that summons issued by the trial court was without any application of mind and without following the law laid down by the Supreme Court.\n“The summons have been issued mechanically by a cryptic and non speaking order and therefore, the order taking cognizance and issuance of summons dated 12.10.2020 cannot be sustained,” it added.\nThus, the Court quashed the order taking cognizance as well as the summons to Sidhu. The entire prosecution was, accordingly, quashed.\nSenior Advocate Ramakant Sharma with Advocate Rakesh Kumar Sharma, Santosh Kumar Pandey and Amresh Kumar represented Navjot Singh Sidhu.\nAdditional Public Prosecutor Jharkhandi Upadhyay represented the State."}
{"ID": "id_309", "Summary": "The Delhi High Court has upheld the selection procedure put in place by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) for the issue of licenses to photographers who had earlier (since 2012) been allowed to take photos at protected monuments without a license. [Mata Prasad and Ors vs Union of India and Ors].\nThe Court has rejected a contention raised by such photographers (petitioners) that they should be treated at par with other photographers who already held licenses prior to 2012 and who were only required to undergo a refresher course to get their old licenses revalidated. \nEffectively, a division bench of Justices Manmohan and Mini Pushkarna has refused to extend the benefit of clause 2.7 of “The Policy for Archaeological Survey of India Photographers to perform within Centrally Protected Monuments\" of 2017 to the petitioners.\nTerming the policy reasonable and fair, the Court said that the policy has been notified by the ASI to regulate photographers within monuments and to ameliorate the condition and treatment of visitors there.\n“The policy mandating the obtaining of licence to work as photographers in ASI protected monuments has been notified by the ASI in larger public interest to regulate the quality and conduct of photographers for the benefit of visitors and tourist,” it added.\nBy way of background, prior to 2012, photographers were required to take a license from the ASI to work in centrally protected monuments.\nHowever, after an amendment to the rules in 2012, between 2012 and 2016, photographers were allowed to work at the monuments simply by purchasing an entry ticket to visit the monument. The license regime was restored in 2018 under the 2017 policy.\nUnder the 2017 policy (which took effect in 2018) those photographers who had secured licenses prior to 2012 were required to only undergo refresher courses to revalidate their licenses. This relaxation was contained in clause 2.7 of the 2017 ASI policy. \nHowever, photographers without a license had to get a fresh license on the basis of various eligibility conditions like age limit, and educational qualifications and also undergo a selection process, which included a written test, a practical test and a viva voce.\nThis was challenged before the High Court by the photographers (petitioners) who had been allowed to work without licenses between 2012-2016. They sought to be treated at par with photographers who held licenses before 2012.\nThe Court, however, opined that merely because the petitioners had earlier been allowed to work in the monuments without a license, it “does not obviate the requirement of obtaining licence in terms of the policy that is prevalent now.”\nThe Court added that photographers applying for a license for the first time cannot claim to be at par with those who held licenses from the ASI prior to 2012.\n“The photographers who are applying for licence for operating in ASI Protected Monuments for the first time are a different class and cannot claim to be at par with the photographers who had valid licences from the ASI prior to the year 2012 in terms of the then policy of the ASI,” the Court said.\nIt also rejected the petitioners’ argument that the ASI's decision was jeopardizing their right under Article 19(1)(g) (right to trade) of the Constitution of India.\n“All those persons who seek to operate as photographers in ASI protected monuments are liable to obtain licence from ASI after participating in the prescribed selection process,” the Court concluded, before dismissing the writ petition. \nAdvocate Taranpreet Singh, Dharm Prakash and Mohd.

Also centres for examination are in different states or far from the aspirants’ place of working which may require travelling and thereby facing travel restrictions,\" the petition said.\nThe petitioners also cited how holding the examination in the midst of the pandemic will pile up pressure on graduate doctors and highlighted how board exams were cancelled.\n\"In the prevailing circumstances due to COVID-19, the conducting of this examination is resulting in building up pressure on the graduate doctors from across India to sit for the examination on 16th June, 2021, when under the present circumstances the Board examinations (Central Board of Secondary Education 10th and 12th Grade) and other professional examinations have been either cancelled or postponed,\" the petition stated.\nMoreover, many doctors are not fully vaccinated and many have not even received the first dose of COVID vaccine. Therefore, holding the examination could endanger their lives, it was contended.\nWhen the matter was taken up as item 7, the Court asked AIIMS why the exam cannot be postponed for a month. \n\"Situation in Delhi has improved but in other places figures are high. cant this postponed by a month,\" asked Justice Banerjee. \nAdvocate Dushyant Parashar, appearing for AIIMS, submitted that if the exam is stayed then there will be an unprecedented crisis. \n\"Staying the exam will create an unprecedented crisis. 1000 doctors will be recruited by this exam. these petitoners can apply in the next September session exam.

{"ID": "id_32", "Summary": "The Karnataka High Court recently granted bail in a rape case after observing that the relationship between the accused and the complainant appeared to be consensual prima facie [Manoj Kumar M R v.

She knew the consequences of having intercourse with the appellant.....It is difficult to arrive at a conclusion at this stage that the appellant used to have sexual intercourse with the second respondent forcibly,\" the Court observed.\nThe allegations against the appellant were that when he was working as a manager in Bajaj Finance Limited he met the second respondent, who was working in the same company. As their relationship developed, he told her he loved her and would marry her, after which he forcibly had sexual intercourse with her. \nFollowing this, he continued to have a sexual relationship with her by threatening to upload intimate videos of them on social media. \nThe respondent became pregnant twice in the next two years, and was forced to terminate both the pregnancies by the appellant. On July 10, 2021, the appellant told her that he would not marry her as she belongs to the “Madiga” caste, and tried to strangle her with a charger wire. Out of desperation, she later attempted to take her own life. On September 6, 2021, the victim made a complaint to the police.\nThe man was charged under Sections 376 (punishment for rape), 313 (causing miscarriage without woman's consent), 307 (attempt to murder) and 417 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), and offences under the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.\nSenior Advocate Hasmath Pasha, appearing for the appellant argued that the intimate relationship between the appellant and the second respondent was entirely consensual. They both presented themselves as husband and wife for the termination of the pregnancies, and she gave her consent for the procedure. As a 27-year-old woman, she knew the consequences of what she was doing. \nMoreover, in August 2021, the appellant approached Vanitha Sahayavani, a community collaboration and helpline of the Bengaluru City Police which provides support to women in distress as he found it difficult to bear with the torture she was putting him through. \nIt was only after he approached the Vanitha Sahayavani services that she filed the FIR. Since there was nearly a 2 month delay in the last alleged incident and the complaint to the police, it indicated that the FIR was an afterthought. Given these facts and circumstances of the case, and since the investigation of the case is already completed, the appellant ought to be granted bail, the lawyer argued. \nCounsel for the second respondent, advocate Dhanalakshmi M, contended that the second respondent was forced into a sexual relationship with the appellant through threats, and that her pregnancies were forcibly terminated. The relationship was developed under the guise of a false promise to marry. \nWhen the appellant found out the caste of the victim, he refused to marry her, which is an offence under the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, it was submitted.\nRegarding the allegations that the appellant refused to marry the victim on account of her caste after which she attempted to take her own life, the Court observed that if the incident were true, it was not understandable why she waited for nearly 2 months before approaching the police. \nIt may have been the case that she approached the police only when she realized that the appellant had made a complaint against her to Vanitha Sahayavani.\nThe Court in disposing of the petition, stated:\n\" ... it is not difficult to arrive at a conclusion that the appellant has been able to make out a case for grant of bail. The Special Court ought to have considered these aspects of the matter at the time of deciding the application for bail. It appears that very routinely the Court below has come to conclusion for denying the appellant's application for bail.\"\nThe man was released on a bail bond of two lakh rupees, and told not to threaten witnesses, tamper with evidence, or influence the woman. He was ordered to appear before the trial court as and when required and not commit any other criminal offence."}

In her statement recorded under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), the victim claimed that the applicant was involved in the alleged incident, despite the fact that she was not named in the chargesheet.\nCounsel for the applicant argued that since his client was a lady, no offence of gang-rape could be made out against her. He contended that the trial court order under challenge amounts to a blatant miscarriage of justice, and should be quashed.\nOn the other hand, the State counsel argued that the applicant committed the alleged offence and it cannot be said that being a lady, she cannot commit the offence of gang rape.\nThe Court noted that the question of whether a female can commit the offence of rape is itself clear by the non-ambiguous language of Section 375 of IPC, which specifically states that the act of rape can only be done by a \"man\" and not by “any woman”. Therefore, a woman cannot commit rape, the Court said.\nHowever, the Court also took into consideration the amended Section 376D IPC, noting that it is a distinct and separate offence of gang-rape, as it says, \n“Where a woman is raped by ‘one or more persons’ constituting a group or acting in furtherance of a common intention, each of those persons shall be deemed to have committed the offence of rape...\"\nThe provision embodies a principle of joint liability and the essence of that liability is the existence of common intention which may be determined from the conduct of offenders revealed during the course of action, the Court added.\nThe Court further observed that the term \"person\" used in the concerned Section should not be construed in a narrow sense.\n\"Section 11 IPC defines ‘person’ as it includes any company or association or body of persons whether incorporated or not. The word \"person\" is also defined in the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary in two ways: firstly, it is defined as \"an individual human being\" or \"a man, woman, or child\"; and, secondly, as \"the living body of a human being\".\"\nFor these reasons, the Court saw no reason to interfere with the trial court order summoning the applicant.\nThe applicant was represented by Advocate Ravindra Prakash Srivastava. Advocate RP Mishra appeared for the State."}

There​ is nothing in the provision to indicate that if such an application or​ petition is not filed before the expiry of the mandate of the learned​ Arbitrator, the Court would be rendered powerless to exercise its authority,\" the order stated. \nThe Court added that no purpose would be served by holding that a Section 29A application to extend the mandate of the arbitrator cannot be filed after the mandate has expired. \n\"Any apprehension regarding inordinate and unexplained delay on the part of the party approaching the Court can be addressed by holding that the Court would extend the mandate only when it is satisfied that sufficient grounds are made out for granting an extension of mandate of the learned Arbitrator,\" the judge further reasoned. \nThe petitioner before the Court, Nikhil Malkan, had sought an extension of the mandate of an arbitrator, which had expired in August 2023. It was argued that the mandate had earlier expired in February 2023. However, the parties had extended the mandate by consent for six more months.\nBy the time the six-month extension expired in August 2023, the arbitration proceedings had reached the stage of final hearing. \nThe final hearing commenced from September 11. When the proceedings were at the stage of rejoinder arguments, an objection was raised by the respondents, SCIL, that the mandate of the arbitrator had expired. \nAggrieved by the objection, Malkan approached the High Court seeking the extension of the expired mandate.\nSCIL opposed the application while referring to two judgments of the Calcutta High Court and a division bench judgment of the Patna High Court. \nThese judgments indicated that even if courts retained their power to extend the mandate of the arbitrator after the expiry of the stipulated period, an application seeking such extension was required to be made prior to expiry of the extended period. \nJustice Pitale disagreed with the views of the two courts and thus rejected the contentions raised by SCIL. \nThe Court also noted that the arbitration proceedings in this case were virtually at the stage of culmination. Therefore, sufficient grounds were made out for seeking a further extension of the arbitrator's mandate, the Court said. \nIn view of this, the mandate was extended till March 31, 2024. \nAdvocates Firoz Bharucha and Abhhishek Bhaduri appeared for Malkan.\nAdvocates SM Algaus, Murtaza Kachwalla and Palash Moolchandani, briefed by Argus Partners, appeared for SCIL."}

State of Odisha and anr].\nJustice RK Pattanaik highlighted that there should be an intention by the perpetrator to insult to insult or humiliate the victim for an offence to be made out under the SC/ST Act.\n“If someone is abused with the name of his caste or the caste is uttered suddenly in course of events and during the incident, in the humble view of the Court, by itself would not be sufficient to hold that any offence under the SC and ST (PoA) Act is made out unless the intention is to insult or humiliate the victim for the reason that he belongs to Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe is prima facie established,” the Court said.\nOn this aspect, the Court also referred to the Supreme Court’s ruling in Hitesh Verma v. State of Uttarakhand and another wherein the top Court had held that an offence under the SC/ST Act would not be established without there being any intention to humiliate the victim on account of his or her caste.\nThe Court also noted the person stated to have been verbally abused by the petitioners on account of his caste had not lodged the case.\nIn view of these factors, the High Court set aside charges levelled against Section 3 of the SC/ST Act against two persons (petitioners) who had moved a plea seeking the same, among other prayers.\nThe case was rooted in a 2017 incident, when the petitioners had got involved in an altercation with certain others. \nAs per the prosecution, the complainant was returning home when he was abused in filthy language, assaulted and terrorised by the petitioners-accused. \nThis led to others arriving at the spot and trying to intervene to rescue the complainant. The victim (who belonged to a Scheduled Caste) was one among such interveners. It was at this juncture that one of the petitioners allegedly criminally intimidated the victim and cast aspersions on his caste.\nIn this backdrop, the Court opined that it was too much of a stretch to assume that the petitioners had intended to insult or humiliate the victim on the basis of his caste.\n“To claim that it was with an intention to insult or humiliate the witness present at the spot and the alleged offences under the Special Act are committed would be like stretching things too far and unjustified,” the Court said.  \nHence, the Court quashed the SC/ST Act charges against the accused.

{"ID": "id_329", "Summary": "The Calcutta High Court recently dropped charges of rape and penetrative sexual assault under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012 against an accused owing to the absence of a medical examination report of the victim (Subrata Pradhan v. State of West Bengal).\nJustice Bibek Chaudhuri held in the judgment that the victim had denied to have herself medically examined and the same would go in favour of the accused.\n\"If a girl of 13 years is violated by a grownup person like the accused, Subrata Pradhan, there must be marks of violence and injury on her private part. The said mark of injury would be visible at the time of medical examination of the victim. However, the victim denied to have examined medically. Thus, the absence of any report of medical examination of the victim would go in favour of the accused and he is entitled to get benefit of doubt,\" the Court held.\nThe Court also found that there were material contradictions in the statements of the victim and evidence of the witnesses, and that there were lacunae in the prosecution case.\nAs per the prosecution case, the appellant tried to propose marriage to the minor girl several times. In December 2017, he allegedly kidnapped her from a bus stand. A complaint was filed by the girl's uncle, and a day later, the police arrested the appellant and brought him and the girl to the police station. At the station, the girl made allegations of forced sexual intercourse against the appellant and three others. She also alleged that she was forced to wear a sari and the appellant put vermilion on her forehead and conch bangles on her hands.\nThe appellant was eventually convicted by the trial court for offences under Section 376 (rape) 363 (kidnapping, abducting or inducing woman to compel her marriage) and 120 B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code as well as Section 4 (penetrative sexual assault) of the POCSO Act. He then approached the High Court in appeal against the conviction.\nThe Court set aside the conviction for the following reasons:\nThe statement made in the FIR itself was in the nature of hearsay. In the FIR, it was alleged that the victim girl was kidnapped on her way to school. However, she stated on oath that the accused picked her up when she was returning home from school and took her somewhere by a vehicle;\nThe victim girl refused to get examined medically after she was produced before the medical officer. In her examination-in-chief, she stated on oath that she declined to get herself medically examined as there was no female doctor in the hospital. Assigning a reason for her refusal to get herself examined medically amounts to material contradiction in the case;\nIn her evidence, the victim girl stated that the accused had taken away her medical documents from her school bag. This was not stated by her before the investigating officer. This amounted to material contradiction in view of the fact that the specific case of the accused is that the accused and the victim girl had developed a relationship and the accused helped the victim girl in her medical examination;\nThe victim girl stated in her evidence that the accused brought her to the local police station. On the other hand, the investigating officer stated that he arrested the accused and the victim girl;\nThe prosecution did not try to collect the birth certificate of the victim girl or the school leaving certificate or any other documents to prove that she was a minor. The prosecution also failed to place her before the medical board for ascertaining of her age. In the absence of such evidence, she cannot be held to be a minor and charge under Section POCSO Act cannot stand.\nThe Court also noted that in such cases, evidence of the victim is the best evidence and conviction can be based on her sole testimony, provided the evidence is held to be trustworthy, cogent, believable and unblemished. However, in this case, Justice Chaudhuri found that the evidence of the victim girl suffered from various infirmities.\nIt further said that it is the duty of the prosecution to prove that there was penetration, and the same was not proved in this case. Thus the charges of rape and penetrative sexual assault were not proven, the Court held.\nThe Bench also set side the conviction of the appellant under Section 366, noting,\n\"She stated in her evidence that the accused, Subrata Pradhan, Prasanta Das and Sampa Das nee Pradhan kidnapped her and took her to a house. Prasanta and Sampa compelled her to wear a saree and Subrata put vermilion on her forehead and conch bangles on her hands. In order to prove the charge under Section 366, the investigating officer did not seize the saree which the victim girl wore on the date of occurrence. He also failed to seize the conch bangles.\"\nThe Court, however, held that the evidence on record proves the commission of an offence under Section 363 (punishment for kidnapping), for which the maximum sentence is seven years in prison.\nWith regard to sentencing, the Court observed,\n\"It is found from the record that the alleged incident took place in the year 2017. The appellant is facing trial for last 7 years. He is a young man working as compounder under a medical practitioner. The prosecution has failed to establish any criminal antecedent of Subrata Pradhan. Therefore, I am of the view that incarceration in the correctional home in association with the seasoned criminals may turn him to a hardcore criminal.\"\nThe Court thus took a lenient view of the case and sentenced him to rigorous imprisonment of one year with fine of ₹10,000.\nAppellants were represented by advocates Phiroze Edulji, Ajit Kumar Mishra and Abhishek Acharya.

{"ID": "id_330", "Summary": "In a significant ruling, the Aurangabad Bench of Bombay High Court has held that if a woman adopts a child after the death of her husband, then the adopted child cannot claim any share in the properties owned by the dead father as he cannot be considered the child of the late father [Rajesh Pawar vs Parwatibai Bende].\nSingle-judge Justice Shrikant Kulkarni accordingly made changes to the shares of an adopted son and a biological daughter of a couple in the present case.\n\"After coming into force of Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956, the child adopted by the widow of the co-parcener, does not get the status of the child of deceased co-parcener from the date of death of co-parcener. As such, adopted son/original defendant No.1 cannot claim share in the suit property, by stepping into the shoes of his late father who died much before his adoption,\" the Court said.\nThe bench was seized of a second appeal filed by one Rajesh Pawar and his family members challenging the decision of a lower court which held that the sale deeds signed between Pawar and Shivaji Tong weren't legal as he (Shivaji) was an adopted child.\nNotably, Shivaji had in 1995 sold part of a land parcel owned by his late father. He was adopted by his mother Kaushalyabai in 1973 much after the death of her husband Sopanrao in 1965.\nKaushalyabai and Sopanrao had only a daughter - Parwatibai.\nIn 1995, Shivaji being the adopted son, sold part of the properties to Pawar family and even signed certain agreements to that effect. However, his mother and sister objected to the same on the ground that the property was of Sopanrao and that Shivaji doesn't have any share in the same.\nHowever, Shivaji contended that since he is an adopted son, he will have equal rights in the properties of his father just like his adoptive mother.\nJustice Kulkarni, however, rejected the contention.\n\"It is an admitted position that the husband of Kausalyabai died in the year 1965 which is much before the adoption of son Shivaji. She has adopted Shivaji vide adoption deed dated March 24, 1993. Therefore, it is clear that adopted son Shivaji was not in picture when her husband died in the year 1965, intestate. The succession opens for the first time in the year 1965. According to Section 8 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956, Kausalyabai being widow and Parwatibai being daughter would get one half share each in the suit property left behind by Sopanrao,\" Justice Kulkarni held. \nThe Court noted that Kausalyabai's husband had died in 1965. \"The succession opens soon after death of Sopanrao in the year 1965. Thus his widow and daughter got one half share each in the property he left behind. Shivaji has been taken in adoption in 1993 by Kausalyabai, who died during pendency of the suit in the year 2013. After her death, her ½ share would devolve upon her daughter Parwatibai and adopted son Shivaji,\" the judge added.\nAccordingly, the Court held that Parwatibai would get 3/4th (1/2 from father's properties and 1/2 from mother's 1/4 share) share in the properties while Shivaji can claim right in 1/4th share. \nThe judge further held the sale deeds between Pawar family and Shivaji as null and void to the extent of the 3/4th share of Parwatibai."}
{"ID": "id_332", "Summary": "If the death of a cop, who died due to bullet injuries in an isolated spot and whose wife is crying foul blaming some people by name does not warrant even a registration of FIR, one wonders what does?\nThis observation came from a Delhi Court which upheld an order directing the police to register a First Information Report (FIR) into the suspicious death of one of their own [Seema Meena & Anr v. State & Anr].\nWhile hearing a revision petition filed against the order of a Metropolitan Magistrate directing the police to register an FIR in the case, Additional Sessions Judge Monika Saroha underscored that the Supreme Court's judgment in Lalita Kumari v. State of UP & Ors must be “honoured in letter and spirit”. It also noted,\n\"Thus, in the present facts, on the one hand, the widow of the deceased is knocking the doors of the very department her husband was serving, seeking atleast registration of an FIR upon the unnatural death of her husband and on the other the police department even in the death of one of its own is acting in a lackadaisical, insensitive and illegal manner by refusing to lodge even an FIR in time.\"\nThe case arose from a complaint of Bula Devi, whose husband’s body was reportedly found on July 26, 2020, with a gunshot injury to its head, inside a car parked at a lonely spot in the jurisdiction of the Saket Police Station, where he was posted as a head constable.\nDevi had filed an application under Section 156 3) Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), urging a magisterial court to order an FIR and investigation into her husband Sanjay Kumar’s “sudden and unnatural death”. She had alleged that her husband was being harassed and blackmailed by his colleagues. A day before he died, Kumar was stated to have apprehended a threat to his life.\nSeeking a fair investigation into the cause of her husband's sudden death, Devi made several complaints to different authorities, including the Deputy Commissioner of Police, South District and the Commissioner of Police. However, no FIR came to be registered.\nUpon hearing Devi’s plea, the magisterial court had called for a status report from the police. The report detailed the nature of the weapon found next to his body, besides an analysis of the call recordings between Kumar and his colleagues, who were allegedly involved in his death.\nHowever, the report concluded that “nothing suspicious” came on record through the police inquiry. Thus, no FIR was registered and the police authorities sought more time to “finalise” the same. The magistrate then directed the registration of an FIR and a probe into Devi's allegations. This prompted the concerned police officers to file a revision application.\nBefore Judge Saroha, the revisionists, also constables with the Delhi Police, sought setting aside of the magistrate order directing the police to lodge an FIR. The order was argued to have been passed in a “mechanical manner” without application of judicial mind and without mentioning the exact penal offences for which the FIR was to be registered. Devi’s several complaints were also alleged to be contradictory in nature.\nBesides, the magisterial court was also said to have ignored the police’s status report and the fact that the forensic results and final post-mortem reports were awaited. Another point argued was that the cause of death was not mentioned in the order which was a “cryptic and non-speaking” one.\nAfter deciding that the revision petition was maintainable, the Court noted,\n“Interestingly or unfortunately, a postmortem has been conducted, inquiry under Section 174 CrPC initiated, crime team reached the spot, wound swabs — blood samples have been seized and sent for chemical examination to FSL, CFSL team also went to the spot and ballistic results have been sought… all this without even registration of an FIR! This court fails to appreciate this ‘reverse gear’ approach adopted by the local police.\"\nIt also underscored the importance of probing incidents such as these, given that the police often develop enmity with notorious elements.\n\"Many notorious elements of any local area develop enmity with serving police officials. Unnatural death of a cop on duty must be effectively investigated especially when the surviving family members are seeking such investigation raising suspicion over the cause and manner of death.”\nIt also came on record that the preliminary inquiry in the present case had been pending for six months before an order was passed by the magistrate.\n“Registration of an FIR is the first step which must be taken in such cases before the police conducts further investigation. This duty of the police becomes all the more important and urgent when the deceased is a police official and his widow is sending written complaints mentioning her suspicion to higher officials of the police department,” noted Judge Saroha.\nWhile refusing to set aside the order, the Court said that once the magistrate has opted to order registration of FIR, while exercising its power of revisional jurisdiction, it cannot substitute its own opinion with that of the magistrate unless something perverse is brought out.\n“The persons against whom suspicion has been raised in this matter are also experienced police officials, therefore, needless to say the investigation must be fair, unbiased and meet gold standards. The proposed accused must also feel secure that the investigation is a fair one,” it added.\nAdvocate Sachin Anand appeared for the revisionist. Additional Public Prosecutor Nischal Singh appeared for the State."}

It makes me wonder if RBI thought about such implications which included socio-economic hardships as well.\"\nThe judge delivered her dissent to the majority opinion rendered by Justice BR Gavai dismissing the batch of pleas challenging the 2016 demonetisation exercise. \nThe following are the highlights of Justice Nagarathna's verdict:\nAction of demonetisation by November 8 gazette notification was unlawful and the 2016 Act and notification were also unlawful. But status quo ante cannot be restored now since it was done in 2016.\nRBI is the bulwark of Indian economy. I have cited history of such demonetisation exercise world over. Court is not to sit over merit of economic or financial decision. Examining Section 26(2) would not mean to sit over the merits of demonetisation and thus it is well within the lakshman rekha as drawn by this Court. \nDemonetisation at the behest of the Centre is a far more serious issue affecting citizens than when it is done by the banks. Therefore, in my view, powers of the Centre being vast, the same has to be by plenary legislation.\nWithout Parliament, a democracy cannot thrive...Parliament cannot be left aloof on such important decisions.\nIn light of interpretation given to \"any series\" (under Section 26 of RBI Act) by me, such recommendation is VOID as applying to all bank notes of ₹500 and ₹1,000\nSince ₹2,000 note was also released thereafter, it can be seen that the object which the Centre sought to achieve through demonetisation may not have been achieved at all.\nOpinion of Central Board of RBI ought to be frank and independent one and needs to be given careful consideration.

{"ID": "id_339", "Summary": "Court cannot teach ethics to people, the Madras High Court recently observed as it quashed a criminal defamation case against a person who had published a cartoon on his Facebook page (Balamurugan v. State). \nJustice G Ilangovan said that the action of the petitioner did not involve any criminality though it might have been unethical. \n\"But the Court cannot teach the ethicality (sic) to the people and it is for the Society to evolve and follow the ethical standards,\" the Court underscored. \nThe petitioner in the case, Balamurugan, had published a cartoon on his personal Facebook page regarding a self-immolation incident that took place outside the District Collector’s office in Tirunelveli in 2017.\nThe cartoon portrayed the burning body of a baby with three nude figures, the District Collector, the Superintendent of Police and the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu watching the same, their private parts covered with currency notes.\nThe District Collector preferred a complaint against Balamurugan deeming the cartoon to be obscene, insulting and defamatory. \nBased on the same, a case was registered for offences punishable under Section 501 of Indian Penal Code (criminal defamation) and Section 67 of the Information Technology Act, 2000 (publishing or transmitting obscene material in electronic form). \nThe accused preferred a petition before the High Court to quash the First Information Report (FIR). \nThe Court said that the question for consideration was \"from where the fundamental rights of freedom of thought and expression must begin and where it must end.\"\n\"In a democratic country, freedom of thought, expression and speech are the foundations upon which democracy survives, without which there can be no democracy and therefore, no evolution of the human society,” the Court observed. \nIt noted that in the instant case, the petitioner wanted to express his anger, grief and criticism regarding the inability of the administration, both executive and police, in containing the collection of exorbitant interest by money lenders. \n\"Three lives were lost in the premises of the collectorate over the demand of exorbitant interest by a money lender. The problem pertains not with reference to the grief, criticism or the social interest which the petitioner wanted to explain and create an awareness in the mind of the people, but the manner in which it was expressed becomes controversy. Depicting the officials right from the head of the executive down to the District Police in that form created the controversy,\" the order said. \nWhile some may feel that the cartoon was an over exaggeration or obscene, others may feel that it conveyed the indifference of authorities in protecting the life of the citizens, the Court observed. \nHence, the cartoon could be perceived differently by different persons.\nTherefore, while the cartoon might have caused feeling of humiliation in the mind of the Collector, the intention of the petitioner was to depict the attitude of authorities regarding the demand of exorbitant interest by the money lenders.\nThere was no intention on the part of the petitioner to defame the Collector, the Court concluded. \n\"Continuing the investigation against the petitioner will make no purpose. In my considered opinion, no criminality is involved in the cartoon and so, the criminal proceedings is liable to be quashed,\" the Court ruled. \nAdvocate S Vanchinathan appeared for the petitioner while Government Advocate M Ganesan appeared for the State."}

{"ID": "id_344", "Summary": "The Delhi High Court recently acquitted a man convicted for preparation of dacoity noting that he was not provided legal aid, a right guaranteed to him under the Constitution of India [Sunil v State].\nSingle-judge Justice Swarana Kanta Sharma observed that right to fair trial is a fundamental right and this right will be vitiated if a poor man charged with an offence is unable to defend himself without a lawyer to assist him.\nThe judge said that legal aid is also a right and the judiciary has to remain vigilant to protect the interest of the poor. \nThe court noted that in the present case, the accused named Sunil has faced trial for nearly 15 years which has already been an unannounced punishment.\n“Considering the overall facts and circumstances of the case, this Court’s judicial conscience does not permit to now remand back the matter and direct the learned Trial Court to again conduct a fresh trial. In view thereof, the accused is acquitted of all the charges since the trial in itself was vitiated due to non-assistance of accused by legal aid counsel, besides existence of several inconsistencies and lacunae in the case of prosecution before the learned Trial Court,” Justice Sharma ordered.\nSunil was arrested by the police in 2007 along with three others for preparing a dacoity. The police alleged that they had found five black masks as well as a country made revolver and other items.\nIt was stated that though, five people were involved in the offence, the fifth person could never be traced.\nAfter considering the facts of the case and the proceeding before the trial court, Justice Sharma observed that even though the trial was for a heinous offence which attracts punishment for up to 10 years, the case was conducted in a most casual manner.\nThe judge added that the accused did not have legal aid of a counsel in a real sense at any stage of the trial and even though an amicus curiae was appointed, it was at the stage when entire evidence had already been recorded.\nEven then, the amicus curiae appeared only twice, the Court said.\n“This Court notes with regret that even at the stage of final arguments, he was not present to defend the appellant who he had been asked to defend at the State’s expense.”\nThe bench also criticised the court below for its indifference and failure to provide legal aid to the accused.\n“Order sheets were written in the most indifferent manner by the learned Trial Court. At most places, the name of the counsel is not mentioned in the order sheets. The name, presence or absence of the counsel was not mentioned in any of the evidence recorded,” the High Court said.\nIt added,\n“The trial court itself should have realized the duty cast on it to provide effective legal aid to an accused who is poor and marginalized and could not defend himself. The courts are the guardians of a person’s liberty and are duty bound by Constitution as well as their oath to ensure fair trial to an accused which is the constitutional goal set by the Indian Constitution itself.”\nThe judge added that in criminal courts, lawyers are an absolute necessity and not a luxury and that is the reason vast sums of money are disbursed to establish legal aid centres and State Legal Services Authorities.\nJustice Sharma, therefore, acquitted Sunil of all charges and also ordered the Registrar General of the High Court to circulate a copy of her judgment to all the District Courts in Delhi and to also send it to the Director (Academics), Delhi Judicial Academy.\nAdvocates Gayatri Nandwani and Mudita Sharda of Delhi High Court Legal Services Committee (DHCLSC) appeared for Sunil.\nState was represented through Additional Public Prosecutor Naresh Kumar Chahar."}

{"ID": "id_347", "Summary": "The Supreme Court recently held that mere breach of contract does not give rise to criminal prosecution for cheating unless a fraudulent or dishonest intention was present right from the beginning of the transaction [Sarabjit Kaur v. State of Punjab and Another].\nA division bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Rajesh Bindal was of the view that merely on the allegation of failure to keep up promise, criminal proceedings cannot be initiated.\n\"A breach of contract does not give rise to criminal prosecution for cheating unless fraudulent or dishonest intention is shown right at the beginning of the transaction. Merely on the allegation of failure to keep up promise will not be enough to initiate criminal proceedings,\" the Court said.\nThe Court also cautioned against using criminal cases to pressurise parties to settle civil disputes.\n\"Criminal courts are not meant to be used for settling scores or pressurise parties to settle civil disputes,\" the bench said. \nBy way of background, a first information report (FIR) was registered against the accused-appellant under Sections 420 (cheating), 120B (criminal conspiracy) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). \nThe basis of this FIR was a third complaint made by the complainant-respondent against the appellant with regard to allegations of cheating in an agreement to sell of a property.\nIn the previous two complaints which were based on the same set of facts as the third complaint, the complainant-respondent had only made the prayer for return of the amount paid by him in the agreement to sell with no allegation of cheating. \nMoreover, the said complaints were only directed at the property dealers and not against the appellant.\nAfter investigation, it was found that no no criminal offence was made out with respect to the first complaint and the complainant was, therefore, granted the liberty to invoke the jurisdiction of the civil court. \nSimilar finding was arrived at in the second complaint as well.\nHowever, in the third complaint, the complainant had accused the appellant of cheating and other offences. On the basis of the same, the FIR Came to be registered against the appellant.\nThe appellant then moved the Punjab and Haryana High Court seeking quashing of the FIR, but the plea was dismissed.\nThis was challenged before the Supreme Court.\nThe apex court after considering the sequence of complaints by the complainant, observed that the effort of the complainant was merely to put pressure on the appellant in order to get his money back. \nMoreover, it was also noted that no efforts were made by the complainant to initiate any civil proceedings against the appellant to get the sale deed executed on the basis of the agreement to sell.\nRather, the complainant proceeded only by filing three identical criminal complaints with the police.\nTaking note that the allegations made in the complaint are civil in nature, the Court observed:\n\"The entire idea seems to be to convert a civil dispute into criminal and put pressure on the appellant for return of the amount allegedly paid. The criminal Courts are not meant to be used for settling scores or pressurise parties to settle civil disputes. Wherever ingredients of criminal offences are made out, criminal courts have to take cognizance. The complaint in question on the basis of which F.I.R. was registered was filed nearly three years after the last date fixed for registration of the sale deed. Allowing the proceedings to continue would be an abuse of process of the Court.\"\nTherefore, the Court allowed the appeal and quashed the case."}

{"ID": "id_35", "Summary": "The Delhi High Court recently pulled up the Assistant Controller of Patents and Designs for rejecting a patent application filed by BlackBerry Limited without reasoning through a \"mechanical, template and cut-and-paste order.\" [Blackberry Limited vs Assistant Controller of Patents and Designs] \nJustice Sanjeev Narula said that the controller should have provided reasons to support the conclusion in order to adhere to the principles of natural justice. \nThe Court emphasized that without proper reasoning in the Assistant Controller's orders, it may be difficult for the applicant to identify the grounds for appeal.\n\"The Controller ought to have disclosed reasons to support his conclusion. Reasoning through a speaking order is a vital aspect of the principles of natural justice and is of utmost importance, which needs to be underscored. If the patent office’s orders lack proper reasoning, it may be difficult for the applicant to identify the grounds for appeal. The legal proposition that an order of such kind should be supported by reasons, needs no reiteration,\" the Court said.\nBlackBerry had filed a patent application in 2008 for an invention that facilitates the selection of small text on touch-sensitive screen devices by zooming in on the text. \nThe application was rejected by the Assistant Controller in 2020 under section 15 of the Patents Act. Hence, BlackBerry moved the Delhi High Court in appeal.\nThe High Court noted that in one of the paragraphs of the Assistant Controller's order, the reasons for dismissing the application were merely a word-for-word replication of BlackBerry's claims and therefore no reasoning was discernible from the paragraph.\nIn the next paragraph of the assailed order, the Court found that it was stated that the requirement of section 3(k) of the Patents Act was not complied with.\nThe Court said that it was unable to comprehend how this conclusion was drawn.\n\"The above lines are the only shred of rationale in the impugned order. The Court is therefore unable to comprehend as to how this conclusion has been drawn. Simply remarking that subject invention is not patentable being a mathematical or business method, a computer programme per se, or an algorithm is not sufficient,\" it stated.\nThe Court observed that the order contained details of the invention, claims made therein and the proceedings, but the crux of the issue was the lack of reasoning supporting the final decision, a task at which the Assistant Controller had completely fallen short.\n\"This makes the decision arbitrary, suggesting a subjective determination without any objective criteria. Such kind of mechanical, template and cut-and-paste orders cannot sustain and must be stridently discouraged,\" it added.\nThe Court highlighted that in a recent decision of the Delhi High Court in Dolby International AB v. The Assistant Controller of Patents and Designs, Justice C Hari Shankar was unable to identify the reasoning in the order assailed in the case and had observed that concerned officers of the Controller of Patents and Designs office must bear in mind that question of grant and rejection of a patent is a serious matter.\nThese words, the Court said, must resonate with the Patent Controller’s officers and they must practice due application of mind while rendering decisions. \n\"Well-articulated reasons in such orders would demonstrate that the decision has been made with proper consideration and allows for more effective judicial review, if necessary,\" it observed.\nHolding that the assailed order failed to satisfy the basic requirements of any order adjudicating on patentability of an invention, the Court determined it was not in a position to examine it on merits and accordingly, quashed it and sent the matter back to the Assistant General for reconsideration before another officer."}
{"ID": "id_350", "Summary": "The Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld the constitutionality of Section 3 of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) Act, which gives the Central government power to establish the NGT [Madhya Pradesh High Court Bar Association v. Union of India].\nA Bench of Justices KM Joseph and Hrishikesh Roy also held that the NGT Act does not oust the jurisdiction of High Courts under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution. \nThe Court rejected the prayer to transfer the seat of the NGT's Madhya Pradesh Bench from Bhopal to Jabalpur was unmerited, noting that Benches are created as per exigencies.\nThe judgment ruled the following:\n- The National Green Tribunal under Section 14 & 22 of the NGT Act does not oust the High Court’s jurisdiction under Article 226 & 227 as the same is a part of the basic structure of the Constitution.\n- The remedy of direct appeal to the Supreme Court under Section 22 of the NGT Act is intra vires the Constitution of India.\n- Section 3 of the NGT Act is not a case of excessive delegation of power to the Central Government.\n- The seat of the NGT benches can be located as per exigencies and it is not necessary to locate them in every State. The prayer for relocating the Bhopal NGT to Jabalpur is unmerited and is rejected.\nThe Court pronounced the verdict in a petition filed by the Madhya Pradesh High Court Bar Association challenging Section 3 of the NGT Act regarding establishment of the tribunal.\nThe plea challenging the provision argued that it gives the Central government excessive, unchecked powers to notify NGT seats/benches without sufficient consultations with Chief Justices of High Courts, the Union Cabinet or the President, as is the constitutional norm for other such decisions related to the judiciary.\nAdditionally, the plea prayed for an NGT Bench in each State, at the place of the Principal Bench of their High Courts, and in this regard a transfer of the Bhopal NGT to Jabalpur. \nThe questions of law before the top court were:\nA. Whether the National Green Tribunal ousts the High Court’s jurisdiction under Sections 14 & 22 of the NGT Act?\nB. Whether a seat of the NGT should be in every State? If yes, should they invariably be established at the principal seat of High Court, which in this case would be Jabalpur instead of Bhopal?\nC. Whether the remedy of direct appeal to the Supreme Court from the decisions of the NGT under Section 22 of the NGT Act is ultra vires to the Constitution? Whether an appeal mechanism be provided to the High Courts from the decisions of the NGT?\nD. Whether Section 3 of the NGT Act is ultra vires to the Constitution as suffering from the vice of excessive delegation?\nCounsel for the petitioners submitted that the location of the present NGT Bench in Madhya Pradesh was arbitrary, and that the direct appeals to the Supreme Court violate the basic structure of the Constitution and so the relevant provisions enabling the same must be struck down. \nCounsel cited the the difficulty of poor litigants in travelling to Delhi for appeals in environmental cases. \nThe Attorney General for India pointed out that the NGT was created based on the recommendations of the 186th Law Commission Report, which mentioned the aspect about direct appeals to the top court. \nThe AG added that remedy to High Court remains available and the Sections in this regard are thus not in violation of the basic structure of the Constitution.\nOn the first question before it, the top court stated,\n\" ... [It is] noteworthy that nothing contained in the NGT Act either impliedly or explicitly, ousts the jurisdiction of the High Courts under Article 226 and 227 and the power of judicial review remains intact and unaffected by the NGT Act. The prerogative of writ jurisdiction of High Courts is neither taken away nor it can be ousted, as without any doubt, it is definitely a part of the basic structure of the Constitution. The High Court’s exercise their discretion in tandem with the law depending on the facts of each particular case.\"\nCommenting on the case load of the NGTs as compared to administrative tribunals, the Bench said proportionality must be applied as the same is not comparable. The petitioners had relied on an observation made with regard to the pendency of cases in administrative tribunals to make a case for more Benches. \nRejecting the prayer of the petitioners with regards to an NGT in Jabalpur, the Bench observed,\n\"The strikingly small 107 cases in the NGT’s Bhopal Bench must also receive our due attention. These data do not provide for a reasonable basis to entertain a prayer for a NGT Bench at Jabalpur\".\nIt elaborated on the same by expressing that the prayer seemed to have been made only for the convenience of Jabalpur-based lawyers. \n\"The low case load in the Bhopal Bench, do not match with the strident plea of the petitioners to locate the Bench at Jabalpur. This is therefore perceived as an attempt by the petitioners (who are practicing lawyers in Jabalpur), to primarily espouse their professional interest. No other rational basis is seen for the Association’s plea for relocation of the NGT Bench to Jabalpur from Bhopal,\" the Court said. \nFurther, if NGT Benches are then established in all States, it would lead to \"the judges and other members in these forums ... twiddling their thumbs.\"\nOn the third question, the Bench explained that the right to appeal before High Courts is \"a creature of the statute and is not an inherent right\". Issuing a writ of Mandamus to enable the same would impinge upon the principle of the separation of powers, it was held.\n\"The options available to a litigant to either move to the Supreme Court in a case where a substantial question of law arises or proceed under Article 226 or 227 must not also be overlooked. If necessary, a party can also approach this Court by way of an Article 136 petition. With such choices being available for a party, no rational justification is found for striking down Section 22 of the Act which provides for a direct appeal to the Supreme Court,\" the Court held. \nA litigating party must realise that in any event, even with High Court appeals they would have to appear in Delhi once the matter reaches the Supreme Court.\n\"Thus, the remedy of direct appeal to the Supreme Court under the NGT Act from the NGT’s decision cannot be seen as denial of access to justice to the litigants in the field of environmental law.\"\nConsidering that litigants from all States would have to travel to Delhi for NGT appeals, and that the top court had itself recommended the exisiting system, the Bench held that the same is intra vires the Constitution. \nWith regards to the excessive delegation contentions as to the setting up of Benches, the Bench noted that since the NGT Act became operational, the location and jurisdiction of the Tribunal's seats have been closely monitored by the Supreme Court. This being an adequate safeguard, the case of the petitioners was not made out, it was held. \nIt was clarified that the present judgment would have no bearing on the merits and outcome of the challenges to the Tribunal Reforms Act of 2021.\nDuring a previous hearing in the matter, the Court had bemoaned the fact that every case before a lower court or tribunal was ending up before the top court.\nThe Court had highlighted how the legislature has been \"dumb\" in providing statutory appeals against orders of the NGT directly to the Supreme Court.\n\"We do not want to use the word, but legislature has been dumb in this regard. We don't want to use the word but that is the word. We do not know what happened to Roger Mathew...every case ultimately ends up in this Court,\" Justice Joseph had said.\nThe plea by the petitioners was argued by advocate Siddharth R Gupta and filed through advocate Mrigank Prabhakar.\nThe Union government was represented by AG KK Venugopal with Additional Solicitor General Aishwarya Bhati.

Being a responsible member of the District Judiciary, the petitioner is expected to render his services wherever he is posted. I fail to see what legal right of the petitioner is infringed by Exhibit P2 order. I am of the opinion that the grounds raised in the writ petition do not justify the grant of any of the reliefs as sought for,\" the order stated.\nKrishnakumar was serving as Additional District and Sessions Judge at Kozhikode when he was transferred as Presiding Officer of Labour Court in Kollam district.\nNotice to that effect was published on the website of the Kerala High Court last week.\nAs per the notice, the transfer was part of the routine transfer and posting of judicial officers and three other judges have also been transferred.\nHowever, it came at a time when the judge had come under scanner for an order passed by him in a sexual harassment case while granting bail to activist Civic Chandran.\nIn the order, he had held that sexual harassment case would not prima facie stand if the victim was wearing a “sexually provocative dress”.\nThe judge had stated that to attract the offence under Section 354A of the Indian Penal, there must be some unwelcome sexual advances but in the instant case, the photographs of the complainant showed her \"exposing herself in provocative dresses\".\n“In order to attract this Section, there must be a physical contact and advances involving unwelcome and explicit sexual overtures. There must be a demand or request for sexual favours. There must be sexually colored remarks. The photographs produced along with the bail application by the accused would reveal that defacto complainant herself is exposing to dresses which are having some sexual provocative one (sic). So Section 354A will not prima facie stand against the accused,\" the order had said.\nThe High Court recently stayed the bail order but ordered that Chandran not be arrested until completion of the hearing before it.\nIn his plea before the High Court, Krishnakumar contended that the transfer order was illegal, arbitrary and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India.\nIt was also argued that a wrong order passed by a judge while discharging his duty cannot be a ground to transfer the judge.\nHowever, during the hearing of the case on August 30, the High Court had asked the petitioner-judge whether there is any material to prove that the transfer was on account of the said order.\n\"What is there to show that it is on account of that (the controversial provocative dress order) that the transfer was effected? It is a transfer simplicitor,\" Justice Sivaraman had remarked.\nShe had also said that a Labour Court judge is well within the cadre of District Judges.\nThe petitioner was represented by advocates Dinesh Mathew J Muriken, Vinod S Pillai, Nayana Varghese and Ahammad Sachin K.

{"ID": "id_356", "Summary": "The Supreme Court today quashed the conduct of National Law School of India University Bangalore's (NLSIU) separate entrance exam, the National Law Aptitude Exam (NLAT 2020).\nThe Court ordered that NLSIU would have to conduct admissions to its courses this year through the Common Law Admission Test (CLAT).\nThe Bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan, R Subhash Reddy and MR Shah had reserved judgment in the matter on September 17 after giving the case an extensive hearing. Earlier, the Court had allowed NLSIU to conduct the contentious NLAT, however, the Apex Court had held that the results would be declared subject to the decision of the Court.\nThe order passed today reads,\n\"In view of the foregoing discussion, we are of the considered opinion that Admission notification dated 03.09.2020 issued by respondent No.1 was not in accordance with law and deserves to be set aside.\"\nThe Court has directed that CLAT 2020 be held on its scheduled date of September 28, in accordance with all the safety guidelines prescribed by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.\nThe results of CLAT 2020 are to be declared as early as possible to ensure that universities can start admissions as soon as possible, the Court further directed.\nFurther, the Court has directed that NLSIU be reinstated to the Secretariat of the NLU Consortium, and that its Vice-Chancellor Prof Sudhir Krishnaswamy be given back his post of Secretary-Treasurer of the Consortium. The order reads,\n\"We are of the view that Status quo ante as on 05.09.2020 should be restored as early as possible i.e. by restoring the respondent No.2 as Secretary of the Consortium as well as restoring the Secretariat of the Consortium to NLSIU, Bengaluru. The governing body may take the decision keeping in mind that CLAT examination scheduled on 28.09.2020 be smoothly held. The respondent Nos.1 and 2 are also to cooperate with the holding of CLAT scheduled to be held on 28.09.2020.\"\nNLSIU's move to conduct a separate entrance exam this year owing to the delayed conduct of CLAT 2020 was challenged by former NLSIU Vice-Chancellor Prof Venkata Rao, along with an aspirant's parent.\nThe Court was urged to quash the September 3 notification announcing the conduct of NLAT for NLSIU admissions this year. Another prayer made is for quashing of NLSIU's notification regarding the technical requirements to write NLAT and for a direction to the University to accept students this year on the basis of CLAT scores.\nThe petitioners had also filed a rejoinder before the Court, asserting that NLSIU miserably failed in conducting the NLAT and has made a large number of candidates suffer. The exam and its procedure lack transparency and cannot be termed “a success” by the widest stretch of imagination, the petitioners averred in their rejoinder.\nThis stance found support from the Consortium of National Law Universities, which had also filed a counter affidavit in the matter through NALSAR Vice-Chancellor, Prof Faizan Mustafa. \nOn the other hand, NLSIU and its Vice-Chancellor Prof Sudhir Krishnaswamy filed affidavits justifying the conduct of its exam, questioning the maintainability of the plea before the Supreme Court, and urging for the writ petition to be dismissed with exemplary costs.\nOne of the central points of contention in the matter was NLSIU's \"unilateral\" decision to hold a separate exam whilst being part of the Consortium, a society which had come to be formed primarily for the purpose of holding a common law entrance test for admissions to NLUs.\nThe technical requirements for writing NLAT were rendering the exam to be \"exclusionary\" and holding potential to deny access to many aspirants, the petitioners has contended. The exam pattern was also starkly different from that of CLAT, for which the students had been preparing for over a year, it was pointed out.\nNLSIU had argued that it was under extreme circumstances that the decision to hold NLAT was taken. It was claimed that University would have to face a zero year scenario if it were to take admissions through CLAT. It was said that the University is the only one in the Consortium to have a trimester system, a difficulty that was expressed to the Consortium. Despite this, NLSIU claimed, the Consortium decided to postpone the conduct of CLAT, which is scheduled for September 28.\nThe University also defended the format of NLAT and said that the pressure threshold in the exam was lower than that of CLAT. It was also argued that AI-based technology was also engaged with in order to identify any instances of malpractice and cheating and such students would be disqualified, it was said.\nThe petitioners were represented by Senior Advocates Nidhesh Gupta and Gopal Sankarnarayanan while the NLSIU and its VC were represented by Senior Advocates Arvind Datar and Sajan Poovayya respectively.\nSenior Advocate PS Narasimha argued for the Consortium."}

Therefore, it is not the proper time to hold the Mela, he argued.\nThe counsel for petitioner submitted that on January 12, 2022, the number of new Covid cases in the State was 22,155. It was further pointed out that the infection rate is 30.86 per cent and a lockdown has been imposed in Jhargram district.\nTherefore, the Mela should not be held especially when there is no tradition of holding it on a particular date or in reference to particular lunar and solar positions.\nHe informed the Court that the District Magistrate of Jhargram had ordered that all government and private offices in the district will remain closed from 6 AM to 10 PM on January 8, 10, 12 and 14, and only minimum staff will remain present for any emergency on those days.\n\"A further direction was issued that all markets, shops and establishments in Jhargram Municipality will remain closed from 6 AM to 10 PM on January 10, 2022,\" the petitioner informed the Court.\nThe counsel for the State submitted that the Mela has been held for the last 8 years and this year, instead of holding the Mela at one place, it has been decided to hold the Mela separately at six places at Jhargram, Paschim Midnapore, Purulia, Bankura, Birbhum and Paschim Bardhaman. Certain special measures for COVID will be adopted at the time of the Mela, it was contended.\nThe Court after hearing the parties noted that there is no past practice of holding the Mela on a particular date of the month or in reference to any particular lunar or solar position. \nIt further observed that the fact that the order passed by District Magistrate has restricted movement of public and private vehicles revealed the seriousness of COVID situation in Jhargram district.\nThe Court ,therefore, proceeded to state that it is not in public interest to hold the Mela on the given date. \nAccordingly, it directed the District Magistrate, Jhargram, to take a decision in respect of postponement of Mela within a period of 24 hours.\n\"While taking the decision, the respondent No. 2 will duly take into account the COVID situation which was prevailing on January 6, 2022 which compelled him to issue the order referred above and if the situation thereafter has improved or deteriorated,\" the Court held."}

{"ID": "id_363", "Summary": "The Delhi High Court recently observed that constant use of derogatory and humiliating words by a wife against her husband and his family amounts to cruelty as a ground for divorce [Deepti Bhardwaj v. Rajeev Bhardwaj].\nWhile upholding the dissolution of marriage and consequent divorce of a couple, a Bench of Justices Sanjeev Sachdeva and Vikas Mahajan noted,\n\"Repeated use of words of the nature as extracted herein hereinabove are clearly humiliating and would certainly amount to cruelty. No person can be expected to live with constant abuse being hurled upon him.\"\nThe Court was hearing a challenge by the appellant-wife against a family court order allowing the petition filed by the respondent-husband under Section 13(1) (i-a) of the Hindu Marriage Act seeking dissolution of marriage on the ground of cruelty. The lower court had also passed a decree of divorce in favour of the husband.\nIn her appeal, the wife contended that the family court had been swayed by a mere suggestion given by the counsel towards the end of the cross-examination of the husband that he had filed the petition for divorce for the reason that he was having an extra-marital affair with his co-worker.\nIt was noted that in the petition filed for divorce, the husband has specifically reproduced the taunts and the language used by the appellant and her father against him and his family.\nSome of the instances of cruelty were spelt out as under:\n\"I am a superintendent in education department, your family is not upto our standard\"\n\"2 kodi ka policewala hai tera baap, mera kuch nahi bigad sakta, ministry tak pahuch hai mere papa ki (your father has no reputation as a policeman, he can't harm me, my father has reach in the ministry)\"\n\"main itna kharch nahi karti jitna teri dawao pe kharch hota hai (I don't spend as much as your medicines cost)”\n\"dikhayi nahi deta baat kar rahi hu, saans ki bimari hai lakwa nahi hai jo khud nahi le sakte dawai (can't you see, I'm talking, you have respiratory disease, not paralysis that you can't take medicine yourself)\"\nIn response to these utterances, the Court said,\n\"Every person is entitled to live with dignity and honour. If the words as stated herein above are used against an individual, the same would be very derogatory and humiliating for the individual.\"\nIt thus found that the conduct of the appellant, which has been proved on record, is of such quality, magnitude and impact as would have caused mental agony, pain, anger and suffering to the husband on a regular and continuous basis, and thus clearly amounted to cruelty.\nThe Court also rejected the contention of wife that specific dates and times of instances of cruelty were not mentioned in the plea decided by family court.\n\"In the facts and circumstances of the case, would lose its significance for the reason that the respondent-husband has in his evidence specifically stated that whenever a quarrel would take place the appellant-wife would use those words against him and his family, which implies that the said words have been used -repeatedly over the period when they were together,\" the order stated.\nAccordingly, the Court was of the view that there was no infirmity in the the family court's findings, and thus dismissed the appeal.\nThe appellant-wife was represented by Advocates Nishit Kush, Mercy Hussain, Siddharth Sikri and Kirti, while the respondent-husband was represented by Advocate Priyanka Gupta."}
{"ID": "id_364", "Summary": "The Supreme Court on Wednesday held that an acquittal in a child sexual assault case cannot be said to be a clean one when the trial has seen witnesses turning hostile, and the complainant reneging on her allegations. [State of Madhya Pradesh and ors vs Bhupendra Yadav]\nA bench of Justices Hima Kohli and Rajesh Bindal made the observation while referring to an acquittal in a case under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO Act) offences where the survivor had failed to support the prosecution's case. \n\"The respondent was acquitted by the trial Court primarily on account of the fact that the complainant did not support the case set up by the prosecution and the other prosecution witnesses had turned hostile. In such circumstances, the respondent’s plea that he had been given a clean acquittal in the criminal case, is found to be devoid of merits\", the bench noted.\nThe observations came while restoring a Madhya Pradesh High Court single-judge order that had upheld a State police decision not to appoint a POSCO-accused to the force. \nThe State police had deemed the accused unfit for the appointment, even though he had been acquitted in the POCSO case filed against him. \nThe POCSO arose out of a 2015 incident, when the main accused (present respondent) and others were alleged to have wrongly confined the minor complainant and tried to outrage her modesty.\nDuring the course of the trial in this case, a compromise was entered into between the accused and the survivor, and the offence of wrongful restraint was compounded. \nThe accused was later acquitted of the charges of sexual harassing and outraging the modesty of the minor, as the survivor did not hold on to her earlier testimonies, and the witnesses turned hostile.\nThe accused man had later applied for a constable's job in the Madhya Pradesh police, where a Superintendent of Police, at the final stages of selection, deemed him unfit for appointment as the POSCO offences were offences of moral turpitude.\nA single judge of the High Court refused to interfere with the decision of the police, but a division bench allowed the man's appeal.\nThe State government, in turn, challenged the division bench ruling before the apex court.\nThe top court, at the outset, noted that though the accused had disclosed the POCSO complaint against him while applying for the police post, the judgment of the trial court in the matter cannot be treated as a clean acquittal.\nThe Court also emphasised that the yardsticks for law enforcement aspirants has to be very strict when compared to other jobs. \nOnce appointed to a law enforcement post, the appointee has a responsibility to maintain law and order and to protect the life and property of the public, the Court noted. As such, the moral standards or rectitude for such a candidate is always higher and more rigorous, the Court said. \nThe possession of a higher moral conduct is one of the basic requirements for an appointment to a post as sensitive as that in the police service, the Court added.\nThe bench, thus, held that mere acquittal of the accused in this case would not automatically entitle him to be declared fit for appointment to the constable post. \nTherefore, the Court concluded that the State government's decision was not malafide or arbitrary. \n\"In such a case, even one criminal case faced by the respondent in which he was ultimately acquitted, apparently on the basis of being extended benefit of doubt, can make him unsuitable for appointment to the post of a Constable,\" the Court said. \nThe State government's appeal was, thus, allowed.\nAdvocate Bharat Singh appeared for the Madhya Pradesh government.

This was the ground reality under which CBI was to function and the Court below was to hear the arguments and pass the order. It is a case in which there is total failure of rule of law. The justice is not only to be done but seen to have been done.\"\nMehta said that there exists sufficient ground to transfer the trial in the case in exercise of powers under Section 407 of the Code of Criminal Procedure since there is a collapse of law and order (CrPC). \nThe Advocate General, representing the State government submitted that in case any application is filed under Section 407 Cr.P.C., all the affected parties are to be heard which include victim, accused and the witnesses of the case before an order can be passed. \nThe High Court, however, disagreed. It noted that the Law Minister of the State along with supporters mobbed the court where the accused were to be presented along with charge sheet. \n\"The Law Minister remained in the court complex throughout the day till the arguments were heard. In these facts and circumstances if any order is passed by the Court the same will not have faith and confidence of the people in the system of administration of justice,\" the Court said. \nConfidence of the people in the justice system will be eroded in case such types of incidents are allowed to happen in the matters where political leaders are arrested and are to be produced in the court, it added. \n\"People may have a feeling that it is not rule of law which prevails but it is a mob which has an upper hand and especially in a case where it is led by the Chief Minister of the State in the office of CBI and by the Law Minister of the State in the Court Complex,\" the Court further said. \nIt, therefore, stayed the order of special CBI court and ordered that the arrested leaders be kept in judicial custody. \nSpecial CBI judge, Anupam Mukherjee had earlier today granted interim bail to the four leaders. \nThe special judge had noted in its order that CBI had not sought custody of the four accused for interrogation but prayer was for judicial custody which cannot be a ground for detention of the arrested persons.\n\"Considering all these aspects the accused persons namely Sir Madan Mitra, Firhad Hakim @ Bobby Hakim, Subrata Mukherjee and Sovan Chatterjee (are) granted interim bail,\" the Court ordered.\nThe bail was subject to the them furnishing bail bonds of Rs. 50,000 each with two sureties of Rs. 25,000 each.\nInterestingly, the special court, in granting bail to the accused, had relied upon the recent judgment of the Supreme Court urging decongestion of prisons to avoid COVID-19 spread.\n\"The Hon'ble Apex court is also of the view of that the over crowding of the accused in the prison might have an effect of the infection of the COVID-19 which should not be encouraged and accordingly, the Hon'ble Apex Court has directed the authorities concerned to deconjest the prison for avoiding the infection in between the inmates,\" the Court said."}
{"ID": "id_379", "Summary": "The Kerala High Court recently held that it will not surrender to the opinions of the Islamic clergy when deciding legal questions since the clergy have no legal training.\nA division bench of Justices A Muhamed Mustaque and CS Dias observed that when it comes to the law, courts are manned by trained legal minds. Only in matters related to beliefs and practices will the opinion of the clergy be considered by the Court, the bench said. \n\"The Courts are manned by trained legal minds. The Court shall not surrender to the opinions of the Islamic clergy, who have no legal training on the point of law. No doubt, in matters related to beliefs and practices, their opinion matters to the Court and the Court should have deference for their views,\" the Court stated. \nIt further said that the intersection of moral injunction and legal right cannot be a determination of the validity of the legal right in a court of law in a secular country.\n\"The intersection of the moral injunction and the legal right shows the accountability to the Almighty in the life hereafter as per the faith, but it cannot be a determination of the validity of the legal right in a court of law in a secular country,\" the Court said in its judgment.\nTo bring home the point that the clergy cannot be relied on by the Court to decide the personal law applicable to the Muslim community, the Court stressed on the distinction between Fiqh and Shariah.\nFiqh has been loosely translated to English as Islamic law and literally means ‘the understanding of what is intended’. Shariah means ‘a straight path’.\n\"Fiqh refers to the science of deducing Islamic laws from thr evidence found in the sources of Islamic law. Ordinary scholars and the Islamic clergy, who have no formal legal training find it difficult to deduce Islamic law from its sources. Fiqh denotes the true intentions and objects of Islamic law. It requires a legal mind to deduce Islamic law from the sources\", the Court observed.\nThe Court was considering a petition seeking review of the Court's previous judgment in which it had declared that the right to terminate the marriage at the instance of a Muslim wife is an absolute right, conferred on her by the holy Quran and is not subject to the acceptance or the will of her husband.\nIn the review petition filed by the husband, he did not dispute the authority given to the Muslim wife to invoke khula, but rather raised, as a ground of review, the procedure acknowledged by the Court to invoke the remedy of khula by the Muslim wife.\nThe Court began its judgment of the review petition with this:\n\"This is a typical review portraying that Muslim women are subordinate to the will of their male counterparts. This review does not look innocuous at the instance of the appellant, but rather appears to have been fashioned and supported by clergies and the hegemonic masculinity of the Muslim community who are unable to digest the declaration of the right of Muslim women to resort to the extra-judicial divorce of khula, unilaterally\"\nInterestingly, it also noted that apart from the husband who filed the review petition, the courtroom was filled with persons who seemed to have an interest in the outcome of the case. The Court decided to permit all interested parties to make submissions, including a a Muslim scholar turned lawyer, advocate Hussain CS.\nAfter hearing all parties, the Court found no reason to review its judgment and dismissed the plea. \nHowever, it made several interesting observations about the legal conundrum in the case. The Court said that it is not a new issue and has evolved over many years as scholars of Islamic studies, who have no training in legal sciences, started to elucidate on the point of law in Islam, on a mixture of belief and practice. \nHowever, the Court pointed out that Islam has a code of law, apart from laying down rules relating to beliefs and practices. Legal norms are the cornerstones of creating a social and cultural order within the Muslim community, it said.\nAs an example, the Court referred to the dilemma faced by the Islamic clergy in understanding triple talaq. The same, the Court opined, was based on the practice followed in society for centuries, related to a decree of the Caliph Umar, that a single pronouncement of triple talaq would constitute a valid talaq. \nReferring to relevant texts on the matter, the Court noted that the Caliph Umar issued the decree in exercise of his executive power to meet a particular exigency, to redress the grievances of women. That executive power was so exercised, to tide over a particular situation. \n\"This decree, though, does not look in tune with the Quranic legislation that refers to cyclic pronouncement of talaq at different intervals, was devised to meet a particular situation in the society at that point in time,\" the Court observed.\nHowever, this practice, allowed at a particular time, was relied upon by the Islamic clergy to justify instantaneous triple talaq, overlooking Quranic injunctions, the Court said.\n\"The Islamic clergy failed to distinguish between the legislative authority of the Quran and the executive power of the Islamic ruler to meet particular contingencies,\" the Court noted. \nThe Court said that dilemma which persisted could be more related to the practice that has been followed for years, overlooking the mandate of the legal norm conferring on Muslim women the right to terminate the marriage without the conjunction of the husband. \n\"The Court in such circumstances is expected to look at the legal norm, if the same relies upon Quranic legislations and the sayings and practices of the Prophet (Sunnah),\" the Court said in its judgment."}
{"ID": "id_380", "Summary": "The Delhi High Court on Thursday reduced the fine imposed on two convicted militants belonging to the banned Kangleipak Communist Party (KCP) of Manipur after noting that their admission of guilt indicated a possibility of reform.\nA division bench of Justices Siddharth Mridul and Anish Dayal noted that the admission of guilt by the two convicts obviated the need for a full-fledged trial at the State’s expense and that it resulted in them nearly serving the full jail sentence of seven years.\nThe reduction in fine has now paved the way for the release of these convicts as they were not able to pay the original fine of ₹39,000 each owing to their family’s financial status. The Court ordered them to pay ₹9,000 each instead.\n“In view of these facts and circumstances and the analysis provided above, it is the opinion of this Court that the fine imposed for each of the nine offences for which the appellants have been convicted be ₹1,000/- per offence (amounting to a total of ₹9,000/- for each appellant) and in default of payment thereof, SI [simple imprisonment] for one month for each offence (amounting to a total of nine months in default thereof for each appellant). It is directed accordingly,” the Court ordered.\nKhoiram Ranjit Singh @ Poerie Meiti and Pukhrihongam Prem Kumar Meiti @PK were convicted by a trial court on April 29, 2022, for various offences under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) as well as Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) and Explosive Substances Act (ESA).\nThe allegations were that they were active cadres of the KCP and involved in anti-national and terrorist activities in Manipur and other parts of the country. In furtherance of a larger conspiracy, they were also alleged to have procured arms and ammunition to carry out terrorist activities in other parts of India, including Delhi.\nBoth the convicts had pleaded guilty to the charges framed against them. Singh’s socio-economic inquiry report revealed that he had an aged mother, three children and a wife (a cancer patient) who was the only earning member of the family. The annual income of the family was stated to be around ₹60,000.\nMeanwhile, Kumar's family had four children and a wife, who was again the sole earning member of the family and their annual income was stated to be around ₹90,000.\nThe High Court considered the case and noted that since the appellants have been convicted for nine offences, the fine has ballooned to ₹39,000  and 30 months of additional sentence if the fine is not paid.\n“Since the substantive sentences run concurrently, the total effective substantive sentence to be served by the appellants is seven years each. The cumulative impact of the default of non-payment of fine would, therefore, amount to 30 months sentence, which is 2 ½ years for each of the appellants. Seen from this perspective, the default sentence would add up to more than one-fourth of the substantive sentence. Therefore, there is merit in the appellants’ submission that this would fall foul of the spirit and tenor of Section 65 IPC,” the Court observed.\nThe bench examined the socio-economic report of the two convicts as well as their unblemished conduct in jail before reducing the fine.\nAdvocates Tara Narula, Astha and Bijaharini Avula of the Delhi High Court Legal Services Committee (DHCLSC) appeared for appellants, Khoiram Ranjit Singh and Pukhrihongam Prem Kumar Meiti.\nThe National Investigation Agency (NIA) was represented by Special Public Prosecutor Gautam Narayan, Public Prosecutor Zeenat Malik as well as advocates Asmita Singh, Harshit Goel, and Siddhant Singh."}
{"ID": "id_381", "Summary": "The Delhi High Court recently held that single judges of the High Court are competent to decide on writ petitions challenging the orders passed by the Intellectual Property Appellate Board (IPAB) before its abolition on April 4, 2021. [Ayur United Care LLP v Union of India & Anr]\nJustice C Hari Shankar passed the ruling while rejecting a contention by a party to an intellectual property rights dispute that only division benches of the High Court could hear petitions against IPAB orders. \n\"I am of the opinion that writs against orders passed by the IPAB prior to its abolition can be heard and decided by the Single Judge of this Court,\" he held in an October 16 judgment.\nJustice Shankar reasoned that Rule 4 of the Intellectual Property Division (IPD) Rules, 2021, effectively states that “IPR Subject Matter or case or proceeding or dispute” shall be decided by a single judge of the IPD.\nThe Court said that the decision of IPAB constitutes an “IPR Subject matter” within the meaning of Rule 2(i) of the IPD Rules.\n“Even if, arguendo (for the sake of argument), the DHC Rules were to apply, they, too, would require these writ petitions to be heard by a Single Judge,” the Court added.\nThe Court further said that the only exception is with respect to cases that have to be decided by a division bench as per Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015.\nJustice Shankar made the observations while dealing with a preliminary objection against the listing of a 2013 case, which involved a challenge to an IPAB order, before a single bench.  \nThe Court said the argument that the hearing of appeals against IPAB orders by single judges would result in “incongruity and abnormality” was fundamentally misconceived.\nIt explained that while hearing and deciding a challenge to an order passed by the IPAB, the High Court acts as a court with jurisdiction of supervision and judicial review. \n“While hearing and deciding an original rectification petition, this Court is exercising an original jurisdiction vested in it by statute. There is, therefore, no incongruity at all, if the Single Judge exercises both powers, for the simple reason that the Single Judge of this Court is regarded, conceptually, as judicially superior to the IPAB,” the Court said.\nOne of the arguments before the Court was that the single judge would have to reconsider the matter himself if it were deemed appropriate to remand the matter for reconsideration, since the IPAB does not exist anymore. \nRejecting the argument, the Court said that in such scenarioes, the single judge would consider the matter de novo or afresh.\n“It is not as though the Single Judge is remanding the matter to himself. The matter is remanded for reconsideration to the authority who, at that point of time, is competent to adjudicate on it. That the said authority happens to be the Single Judge does not convert the order into a remand by Caesar to Caesar,” it added.\nIn conclusion, the Court opined that any hesitation or refusal - short of recusal - by a single judge to hear such matters would amount to an abdication of judicial functions.\nAdvocates N Mahabir, PC Arya, Noopur Biswas, Sushant Singh, Akshat Gupta and Saurav Pattnaik represented the petitioners.\nCentral Government Standing Counsel (CGSC) Harish Vaidyanathan Shankar with advocates Srish Kumar Mishra, Sagar Mehlawat, Alexander Mathai Paikaday Sriram, Krishnan V and CGSC Vikram Jetly with Shreya Jetly represented the Union of India.\nSenior Advocate Arvind Varma with advocates J Sai Deepak, Afzal B Khan, Samik Mukherjee, Debjyoti Sarkar, advocates Ajay Sahni, Ankit Sahni, Chirag Ahluwalia and Mohit Maru represented other respondents.\nSenior Advocate Akhil Sibal was the Amicus Curiae and appeared with advocates Asavari Jain and Sanya Kumar."}

The High Court has proceeded on the erroneous basis that no overt act has been assigned to the second respondent. There was no change in circumstances warranting the grant of bail,” the apex court stated.\nThe judgment was passed in an appeal filed by the son of the deceased, Daansingh who was shot dead on September 11, 2017.\nA case for murder and other offences under the Indian Penal Code (IPC_ and Arms Act were registered against the respondent and other accused.\nThe prosecution case was that the mobile phones and sim cards recovered from the accused-respondent showed that she was constantly in touch with the co-accused in the case. Further, a day prior to the incident, the respondent and one Bhuria had come to the office of Assistant Superintendent of Police and threatened to murder Daansingh. It is also the prosecution argument that the respondent had informed the shooter about movement of the deceased.\nThe respondent’s bail plea was rejected by the High Court four times but she was successful in her fifth attempt.\nThe High Court allowed the fifth application for bail observing that the respondent is a woman, she has been in custody for three years and ten months, no overt act was assigned to her, co-accused Vijaypal was granted bail and the conclusion of the trial is likely to take time.\nAdvocate Namit Saxena, counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant, submitted that the High Court was in error in proceeding on the basis that no overt act was attributed to the second respondent since the charge-sheet, which has been submitted after investigation, indicated that she was using as many as four sim cards and was in constant contact with Prahlad, the co-accused who was hired as a sharp shooter, and her son Anek, who is also a co-accused. It was further contended that the respondent was the custodian of the weapons used in the crime.\nAs regards co-accused Vijaypal being granted bail, it was pointed out that since he has not been charge-sheeted, no parity could be claimed.\nIt was also highlighted that the High Court had in its order dated September 8, 2020 specifically noted that the respondent was not co-operating in the investigation.\nMoreover, four earlier bail applications have been rejected and there was no change in the circumstances to warrant the grant of bail, it was contended.\nThe State of Rajasthan also supported the stance of the appellant and opposed grant of bail.\nSenior Counsel Vivek Sood, appearing on behalf of the second respondent, submitted that the incident took place outside the house of the deceased in which event, the role attributed to the respondent is rendered meaningless.\nSood argued that there has been a clear over-implication of members of the family in the FIR since as many as six persons are alleged to have shot at the deceased whereas only two bullets were recovered.\nThe second respondent is sixty years old and was released on bail after being in custody for three years and ten months. Further, only 28 out of 58 witnesses have been examined and the trial is likely to take some time, he submitted.\nThe top court after examining the contentions held that the observation by the High Court that no overt act has been assigned to the respondent, is erroneous.\nThe Court said that the probe has revealed that the respondent was using as many as four sim cards and was in touch with one of the sharp-shooters who was hired to commit the crime.\nFurther, as per the chargesheet, she was the custodian of the weapons which were stored at the rental premises where she resided.\n“Moreover, there is a specific allegation that the second respondent has actively aided the commission of the crime by furnishing information about the movements of the deceased (Daansingh) to the killers. There has been an evident error on the part of the High Court in surmising that no specific or overt act is attributed to the respondent,” the Court said.\nPertinently, the Court said that considerations which must weigh in the exercise of the power of the appellate court to determine whether bail has been granted for valid reasons stand on a distinct footing from an application for cancellation of bail.\nIn view of the above, the Court set aside the bail granted to the accused by the High Court."}

{"ID": "id_384", "Summary": "A man convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for killing his wife had his sentence commuted to 12 years imprisonment by the Bombay High Court on the ground that the act was a result of sudden and grave provocation and not a pre-meditated one [Nandu Dada Survase vs State of Maharashtra].\nA Bench of Justices Sadhana Jadhav and Prithviraj Chavan reduced the sentence after noting that the wife had shouted on a busy road that the convict (her husband) was impotent, and it was natural for a man to feel ashamed upon being so labelled.\nThe Court noted that on the fateful day, suddenly upon seeing the accused by chance, the deceased had not just obstructed his way by holding his neck, by pulling his shirt but had started hurling abuses and had levelled scathing remarks.\n\"The incident had occurred on a busy road near the residential house of Ananda More. The loud allegations made by the deceased were heard by one and all. It was quite natural for the man to feel ashamed upon being referred as impotent,\" the Court said.\nIt, therefore, concluded that the act by the accused was not a premeditated one but one which came out of sudden and grave provocation and that the appellant had no criminal intention to murder his wife. \n\"It is true that the incident of assault is outcome of a grave and sudden provocation. The accused was deprived of his self-control and hence, he could not have any restraint upon himself while mounting assault. It was not a pre-meditated act,\" the judgment said.\nHence, only the offence under Section 304(II) (culpable homicide likely to cause death) of the Indian Penal Code can be maintained.\n“It was not a pre-meditated act. He was on his way for work and therefore, was carrying a sickle in his bag. The offence committed by the accused falls under Exception 4 to Section 300,” the Court emphasised before stating clearly that the accused deserved to be convicted only under Section 304(II) to meet the ends of justice.\nThe Court passed the judgment on an appeal challenging the conviction of the appellant by a trial court under Section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), after which he was sentenced to undergo life imprisonment.\nThe appellant had allegedly assaulted the deceased when they both got into a heated altercation at a bus stop. During the course of the heated exchange, the deceased is said to have suddenly and gravely provoked the appellant. Infuriated by the same, the accused supposedly assaulted the deceased with a sickle he was carrying for work.\nAfter a prosecution witness, who was also the investigating officer, demonstrated the omissions and discrepancies in the evidence of their witnesses, the element of sudden and grave provocation by the deceased was proven. \nThe three witnesses were all members of the deceased's family and claimed that the deceased had been attacked without any provocation.\nThe appellant's counsel, advocate Shraddha Sawant, however requested the Court to consider the circumstances surrounding the occurrence.\nThe Court considered the lawyer's plea and noted that the appellant and the deceased had been married for 15 years and had three children together. They had been separated for four years prior to the event and had not interfered in each other's lives until the day of the incident. \nPrior to being killed, the deceased had not only hindered the appellant's path by grasping his neck and yanking his shirt, but had also begun shouting obscenities which deprived the accused of his self-control. \nThe Court, therefore, allowed the appeal in part and commuted his sentence to the period of incarceration already undergone (12 years)."}

These charges were based on his defiance of the court's orders in a temple related dispute and his circulation of a letter through WhatsApp maligning the image, reputation and prestige of the court.\nPrior to the initiation of contempt proceedings, an enquiry was conducted by the District Judge (Vigilance) and the complaint made by the contemnor against the judicial officer was found to be incorrect. \nThe complaint was closed but a decision was taken to initiate contempt proceedings against the contemnor keeping in view the complaint made by him.\nThe counsel for the contemnor justified his action of making the complaint and simultaneously tendered an unconditional apology. \nHe said that the temple in dispute in the case before the judicial officer was a private trust and therefore, a direction for involvement of the revenue authorities and putting a lock in the donation box was not called for.\nThe Court held that the arguments justifying the action of the contemnor were of no help as there was no explanation tendered for making reckless allegations against the judicial officer.\nFurther, the complaint was duly investigated and found to be baseless by relevant authorities, the Court said.\nHence, the Court held the contemnor guilty under Section 2(c) of the Contempt of Courts Act and determined that he was liable to be punished under Section 12 of the Act.\nDuring the sentencing phase, counsel for the contemnor pleaded for a lenient punishment, suggesting that only a fine should be imposed. \nHowever, the Court concluded that a fine alone would not suffice. Consequently, it sentenced the contemnor to ten days of imprisonment, in addition to a fine of ₹2,000 to be paid within seven days. \nFailure to pay the fine within the specified period would result in another ten days of imprisonment, the Court directed."}

A single-judge ruled in his favour in 2015 but a Division Bench gave a split verdict on the bank's appeal. Hence, the case came to be heard by a referral Bench which in August 2019 ruled in favour of Gangopadhyay who was reinstated in service on that basis. \nBut the bank refused to pay his back wages for the period during which he was in suspension which prompted Gangopadhyay to approach the High Court once again. \nAdvocate SP Lahiri submitted on behalf of Gangopadhyay that based on a co-joint reading of the orders of 2015 and 2019, back wages should be given for the period between 2014 to 2019. \nHe relied upon the Regulation 15 of the Allahabad Bank Officer Employees‟ (Discipline & Appeal) Regulations, 1976 which stated that the employee should be paid fully if 'employee is fully exonerated or suspension is unjustifiable'.\nAdvocate ON Rai for the bank opposed the plea pointing out that the orders of 2015 and 2019 did not explicitly order payment of back-wages to Gangopadhyay for the period under deemed suspension.\nThey Court found the plea by Gangopadhyay meritorious on the ground that \"it has been more than five years and no departmental proceedings have been initiated against the petitioner and this Court had directed that the petitioner was entitled to get \"all benefits‟ pursuant to the impugned order dated April 21, 2015.\"\nThe court directed the bank and its authorities to pay the differential salary to Gangopadhyay within a period of 4 weeks for the period commencing from May 2-15 till his date of joining along with interest at the rate of 8 percent.\nIn the event, the bank fails to make the payment, the court provided for further penal interest at the rate of 4 percent per annum on the differential salary till the payment.\nThe Court also expressed hope that the bank would not go for further litigation by pursuing an appeal. \n\"This Court sincerely hopes that the wiser minds in the decision making process in the bank shall now comply with these orders and not continue the litigation any further to bring quietus to the lis.\" \nEven though they have a right to appeal, the said right may not always be the right course of action, the Court added."}

However, it would not extend to the services which comes under land, law and order and police. Lieutenant Governor (LG) shall be bound by the decision of NCT Delhi over services apart from land, police and law and order.\"\nExplaining the reason behind its decision, the Court said,\n\"LG shall exercise powers under the administrative role as entrusted by the President. Executive administration can only extend to matters which fall outside the scope of the legislative assembly...and it cannot mean administration over entire NCT Delhi. Otherwise, the purpose of having a separate elected body in Delhi will be rendered futile. Democratically elected government shall have control over its officers. If a democratically elected government is not allowed to control its officers and hold them to account, then its responsibility towards the legislature and public is diluted. If officers are not responding to the government, the collective responsibility is diluted. If officers feel they are insulated from the elected government, they feel they are not accountable.\"\nThe judgment stated that while a state or union territory has the power to make laws on subjects under the Concurrent List, the same will be subject to the existing Central law. At the same time, it has to be ensured that the governance of states is not taken over by the Central government, the Bench opined.\nThe Court went on to hold that sub-clause (b) of Article 239AA clarifies that Parliament has the power to legislate on any subject related to the NCT in any of the three lists. If there is a repugnancy between law enacted by legislative assembly and law enacted by the Central government, the former will be rendered void, it stated.\nThe Court had reserved its verdict in the matter on January 18 this year.\nThe case arose in 2018, when a Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court had interpreted Article 239AA of the Constitution, which contains special provisions with respect to the National Capital Territory (NCT). The peculiar status of the NCT and the powers of the Delhi Legislative Assembly and the LG and their interplay were debated in the case.\nThe Court in that judgment had ruled that the LG cannot act independently without the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers, and has to work harmoniously with the NCT government.\nThe appeals relating to individual aspects including services were then placed before a regular bench for adjudication based on the Constitution Bench judgment.\nThe regular bench had on April 14, 2019, pronounced its verdict on various individual aspects relating to the tussle between the Delhi government and the LG. However, the two judges on the Bench - Justices AK Sikri and Ashok Bhushan - had differed on the issue of 'services' under Schedule VII, List II, Entry 41 of the Constitution of India\nThe issue considered by the Court was whether the exclusion of “services” relatable to Entry 41 of List II of the Seventh Schedule from the legislative and executive domain of the NCT of Delhi, vide a notification of the Government of India dated May 21, 2015, is unconstitutional and illegal.\nSince the judges differed, that aspect was referred to a three-judge bench. This new bench then referred the matter to the Constitution Bench on the Centre's request.\nThe primary basis of the prayer to refer it to a five-judge bench was that the majority judgment of the Constitution Bench did not consider the purpose and intent of the expression “insofar as any such matter is applicable to Union Territories” as it occurs in Article 239AA(3) of the Constitution, which is the pivotal and crucial aspect of the said provision.\nRead our coverage of Day 1 of the hearing here.\nRead our coverage of Day 2 of the hearing here.\nRead our coverage of Day 3 of the hearing here.\nRead our coverage of Day 4 of the hearing here.\nRead our coverage of Day 5 of the hearing here."}

At best, the tool could be utilised for a preliminary understanding or for preliminary research and nothing more,” Justice Singh said.\nThe Court made these observations while dealing with a suit filed by French footwear and accessories company Christian Louboutin which is famous for its red sole and spiked shoe style. \nIt alleged that a firm by the name 'The Shoe Boutique – Shutiq' was manufacturing identically designed shoes in several cities in India.\nAdvocate Pravin Anand appeared for Christian Louboutin and said that the reputation of the plaintiffs can also be evaluated based on a ChatGPT query.\nWhen the chatbot was asked “Is Christian Louboutin known for spiked men's shoes?”, it answered in the affirmative.\nHowever, the Court noted that when other questions were put to ChatGPT, it said there are several brands known for manufacturing and selling shoes with spikes and studs and that Christian Louboutin is one of them. When it was asked for a list of such brands, it gave a list of ten including the plaintiff.\nOn the issues raised in the suit, the Court concluded that the defendants’ products are indeed know-offs of the plaintiff’s distinctive shoes and footwear and that Shutiq has copied all the essential features of Christian Louboutin.\n“The imitation is not of one or two designs but of a large number of designs as the chart above indicates. The acts of the Defendant are nothing more but an attempt to pass off its own goods as the goods of the Plaintiffs,” the Court said. \nJustice Singh, therefore, recorded the undertaking of the proprietor of the defendant company that it shall not copy or imitate any of the designs of the plaintiffs’ shoes.\n“If any breach of this undertaking is found, the Defendant would be liable to pay a lump sum amount of Rs.25 lakhs as damages to the Plaintiffs immediately upon such evidence coming to notice of the Plaintiffs. In addition, considering the fact that the Defendant is also using the pictures of well-known Bollywood celebrities on its Instagram account, etc., and also has displayed/ sold the shoes in high end malls, it is directed that the Defendant shall pay a sum of Rs.2 lakhs as costs to the Plaintiffs within four weeks… The Plaintiffs are also given a refund of 50% of Court fees,\" the Court ordered. \nAdvocates Pravin Anand, Dhruv Anand, Udita Patro and Nimrat Singh appeared for Christian Louboutin.\nDefendant Shutiq was represented through advocates Amit Verma and Siddhartha Luthra."}
{"ID": "id_396", "Summary": "The Madras High Court recently directed the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) to consider Ayurveda, Yoga, Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy (AYUSH) treatments at par with allopathy while dealing with insurance claims. \nIn an order passed on November 21, Justice N Anand Venkatesh said it was “discriminatory” on part of insurance companies to “give preference to allopathy over AYUSH treatments,” or to fix different maximum caps and reimbursement amounts for AYUSH and Allopathy treatments in one’s insurance schemes.\n“The third respondent must bear in mind that the traditional treatment in India which falls under the head of AYUSH treatment must also be encouraged and it must get the same weightage as is given to allopathic treatment and a person, who chooses to undergo AYUSH treatment should be entitled to receive the insurance amount towards the expenses incurred by him, as is done to a patient who undergoes allopathic treatment. This has to be implemented by the third respondent in all future policies,” Justice Venkatesh said.\nThe judge said that the insured undergoing medical treatment have the right to chose either allopathy or traditional treatments recommended under AYUSH.\nJustice Venkatesh further reminded IRDAI that during the COVID 19 pandemic when health services were overburdened and were treating emergency cases day and night, medical practitioners had recommended traditional treatments, home remedies and AYUSH treatments for those with milder infections.\n“In such circumstances, it will not be reasonable to restrict the cap and thereby deprive the policy holders to get reimbursement of the amount, which was spent by them in AYUSH hospitals,” the Court said.\nThe Court was hearing two petitions, one filed by a lawyer and another by a clerk, seeking reimbursement of the amounts claimed by them under their respective insurance policies.\nDuring the hearing, the Court realised that as per IRDAI regulations, a cap was placed on the maximum amount of reimbursement to be provided for availing treatment at AYUSH hospitals. Such cap was much less when compared to that for allopathic treatments under similar policies, the Court noted.\nWhile in the present case, the private insurance company in question eventually drafted a comprehensive policy to cover AYUSH treatments as well.\nThe Court then directed IRDAI to take similar steps.\n“There shall be a direction to the third respondent to act upon the suggestion made by this Court to place AYUSH treatment on par with allopathy treatment and direct the insurance companies to reimburse the insurance amount on equal scales. Both the writ petitions are disposed in the above terms,” the Court said."}
{"ID": "id_397", "Summary": "The Patna High Court last week rejected a death reference by the State in a Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act case, finding that it was decided in a hasty manner by Special Judge Shashi Kant Rai [The State of Bihar v Md. Major].\nA Division Bench of Justices AM Badar and Rajesh Kumar Verma remanded the case for fresh trial from the stage preceding framing of charge.\n“It is interesting that there is a saying in Arabic to the effect that ‘haste is from shaitaan’. In formulating and effecting the justice system, the judges should be made more efficient to be able to deliver justice in a timely and not a hurried manner,” the Court noted.\nThe death sentence was ordered by Special Judge Shashi Kant Rai who had been placed under suspension from February this year, proceedings against whom were later dropped after the Supreme Court's intervention. \nHe was suspended for convicting and sentencing a man to life imprisonment for sexual assault of a minor after having heard the case for one day, and for issuing a death sentence after hearing a case for four days.\nThe top court had said that it would be in the best interests of everyone involved if the disciplinary proceedings against the judge were dropped, especially since it may send a negative message to other judges as well.\nThe High Court, in the case at hand, also observed that the trial court had failed to act neutrally while conducting the trial.\n“It is not possible to infer that the accused was fairly dealt with by an unbiased Judge in an atmosphere of judicial calm.”\nWhile highlighting that the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) does not contemplate recording of evidence of prosecution witnesses immediately on the very same day after framing of the charge, the Court said,\n\"For adhering to the principles of natural justice, the Trial Court is therefore supposed to adjourn the case for recording evidence of prosecution after a gap of few days after framing of the charge. Ugly hurry in recording evidence of prosecution immediately on the very same day after framing of the charge, particularly, when the accused is an under trial prisoner would defeat the ends of justice and can cause prejudice to both the parties.\"\nThe High Court was hearing a death reference wherein a Special POCSO judge had convicted the appellant of rape, offences under the POCSO Act and the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, subsequently sentencing him to death penalty with a direction that he be hanged by neck till he is dead. \nThe order of conviction was passed on January 25 this year, five days after the court took cognizance of the matter.\nIn the case at hand, the accused was not given an opportunity to go through the police papers, and was incommunicado throughout, as he had no means to contact his advocate. \nHe also had no opportunity even to read the charge sheet till the end of the trial, and his applications for adjournment were refused without an opportunity to adduce defence evidence despite his plea of an alibi. Additionally, evidence was recorded in his absence.\nThe accused claimed that he had not been accorded fair trial while stating that everything happened in \"ugly haste\" without an effective opportunity of hearing.\nAt the very outset, the High Court emphasised that the opportunity of being heard has to be real, reasonable and effective.\n“The same should not be for name sake – a paper opportunity particularly when the life and liberty of an accused is at the stake.”\nThe Bench said that every judge was required to keep this basic concept of fair play in mind while conducting criminal trial.\nThe fact that the trial court took 40 minutes to pronounce its judgment after completion of arguments was also raised by the High Court as a concern.\n“Our practical experience says that this is humanly impossible… A lurking doubt arises as to whether the Judgment was kept ready and farcical hearing was granted to the parties.”\nFurther, it was observed that while a judge can do away with a technicality coming in the way of substantial justice, the entire procedure governing a civil or criminal proceeding should not be considered a mere formality or technicality.\n“Because once you start belittling the significance of procedure your ability to appreciate its relevance and value to the administration of justice and resultantly your interest and respect for the procedure would start declining,” the judgment stated.\nTherefore, the Court stated that the manner in which the trial was commenced, conducted and concluded clearly displayed and demonstrated a glaring abuse and misuse of judicial power by the trial court while exercising judicial function.\n“There is no alternative but to direct for De-novo Trial of the accused from the stage before framing of charge,” it was concluded.\nThe death sentence was answered in the negative, the judgment of the trial court was set aside and the case was remanded to the trial court for fresh trial.\nAmicus Curiae Prince Kumar Mishra, APP Satya Narayan Prasad and Vijay Kumar appeared for the State.\nThe accused was represented by Senior Advocate Sanjay Singh and Advocates Raj Kumar, Vijay Kumar, Sudhanshu Shekhar, Rajnish Kumar and Sarvottam Kumar.\nAdvocate Ranjit Kumar Thakur appeared for the informant."}

The bus was replete with attractive images. \n\"Earning of additional income by KSRTC or KURTC by the display of advertisements on their transport vehicles, under Rule 191 of the Kerala Motor Vehicles Rules, should not be at the cost of public safety,\" the Court underscored.\nThe Court also noted that vloggers post content on social media promoting vehicles that have flashy neon lights and DJ sound systems.\nIt ordered that such vloggerers be proceeded against legally as per the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act and the Indian Penal Code.\nFurther, Ministry of Road Transport and Highways was directed to ensure to take necessary steps to ensure that such videos promoting the use of motor vehicles in public places are not being uploaded in ‘YouTube’ and other online platforms.\nThe order was passed in a matter in which the court had taken suo motu cognisance in the wake of the recent Vadakkencherry bus accident in which nine persons, including five school children, died and over forty persons were injured.\nOver the course of a few hearings held since the accident occurred, the Court found that the tourist bus carrying the school children that was involved in the accident seemed to have been flouting several safety norms. \nPertinently, it noted that the bus seemed to have flashy lights of the kind that the Court, by a previous order, had explicitly prohibited in line with the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act and Rules.\nTherefore, the Court directed that penal consequences under the Motor Vehicle Act will be taken against the driver of the bus and also, the owner of the bus involved in the Vadakkenchery accident, since they caused or allowed such a vehicle to be driven in a public place.\nPertinently, the Court opined that the procedure being adopted by the Motor Vehicles Department and the Police where they permit the use of vehicles that flout norms if they remove the unauthorised fittings, is a flagrant violation of the statutory provisions as well as the order of the Court. It said that a total prohibition is required on such vehicles.\nThe Court further clarified that apart from the lighting and sound system violation, the bus body, passenger compartment, and driver cabin of contract carriages will have to be maintained in the appropriate manner in terms of its construction and maintenance, in order to comply with the Motor Vehicle Act.\nAccordingly, it ordered that the fitness certificate of contract carriage violating the Motor Vehicle laws be suspended for three months and the driving license of the driver driving that vehicle be suspended for three months as well.\nIt further ordered that stringent action be taken against the owner and driver of vehicles that are used in a public places after tampering with the speed governor and also if the driver of the contract carriage is drunk or under the influence of drugs.\nThe matter will be taken up next on October 14."}
{"ID": "id_40", "Summary": "Members of the Armed Forces are not to be unnecessarily harassed and \"made ping pong of\" from one forum of adjudication to another, the Delhi High Court recently said (Brijlal v. Union of India).\nThe order passed by a Division Bench of Justice Rajiv Sahai Endlaw and Asha Menon reads,\n\"Members of a force, who take oath of laying down their lives for the country, form a distinct class and deserve a special treatment. They are not to be harassed unnecessarily and made ping pong of, by sending them from one forum of adjudication to another.\"\nIt was also held that the Armed Forces Tribunal is bound by the decisions of the High Court under the principles of stare decisis (precedent).\nThe Court was dealing with a batch of petitions challenging an order issued by Union Ministry of Defence (MoD) granting the benefit of pro-rata pension only to Commissioned Officers of the Defence Services and not to the Non-Commissioned Officers (NCOs)/Persons Below Officer Rank (PBORs).\nThe petitioners before the Court were NCOs/PBORs who joined the Indian Air Force (IAF) as Airmen/Corporals. \nWhile dealing with the same issue, a Division Bench of co-ordinate strength in Govind Kumar Srivastava v. Union of India had held that the Armed Forces Tribunal (AFT) could not entertain a challenge the MoD order and allowed pro-rata pension to the petitioners therein. \nIn view of this order, over the last five months, other benches of the High Court allowed a large number of similar petitions on the very first day they came up before the Court. It was directed by these benches that if the petitioner/s, on verification, were found to be similarly situated as the officers in Govind Kumar Srivastava, they would be granted pro-rata pension. \nHowever, while dealing with the present case, the Court found that the AFT had been declining the relief of pro-rata pension to NCOs. \nAlthough the IAF sought to distinguish the order passed by the High Court from the orders passed by the AFT, the High Court refused to form a view any different from that of the co-ordinate Bench in Govind Kumar Srivastava.\nThe Court also rejected the Central government's plea to transfer the present batch of the petitions to the AFT for adjudication. \nAcknowledging the oath taken by the petitioners, even to the peril of their lives, the Court said, \n\"The petitioner/s in all these petitions are members of the Armed Forces who are the only ones required under the Constitution of India and under the laws, to take an oath, of abiding by the command issued to them by the President of India or by any officer set over them, even to the peril of their life. The oath required to be taken, neither by the President of India or by the Vice President of India or by the Governors of the States or by the Judges of the Supreme Court and the High Court requires them to lay down their lives in the service of the country.\"\nThe Court added that the members of the Armed Forces put their lives to high risk and thus, the country owed respect and gratitude to them.\nComing to the present case, the Bench held that the IAF's refusal to grant pro-rata pension to NCOs, in violation of the law laid down by the Court, was a sheer act of harassment. \n\"...(IAF's refusal is) a sheer act of harassment of ex-servicemen, forgetting the oath given to them and while demanding fulfillment of such oath, compelling the petitioners to approach this Court and wanting to repeatedly contest the same issue. Such action of the respondents IAF, we find to be in abuse of the process of the Court.\"\nThe Court added that it was \"rather surprised\" that although the AFT was bound by the law laid down by the High Court, it had taken a contrary view.\nCalling the AFT's conduct as \"adventurism\", the Court said, \n\"Once the orders of the AFT are subject to judicial review by this Court, if AFT were to continue to pass orders disregarding the law laid down by the High Courts, the same would result in chaos, with petitions under Article 226 being filed in the High Courts terming such orders of the AFT as patently illegal and would defeat the principle of stare decisis and purpose of tribunalisation i.e. of expeditious disposal of disputes of personnel of the Armed Forces.\"\nIAF sought to reason that award of pro-rata pension carried a huge financial burden of Rs 44 crore per month and of Rs 250 crore in payment of arrears. \nThe Court, however, said that the same could not come in the way of the implementation of its earlier order, as the State could not take a plea of financial burden to deny the payment of legitimate dues.\nThe petitions were accordingly allowed with a direction to the IAF to pay arrears of pro-rata pension to the petitioners in a time-bound manner. \nRead the order:\nMembers of Armed Forces cannot be harassed unnecessarily and ping-ponged between judicial fora: Delhi High Court https://t.co/tzFKhzJwjZ"}

He said that she owns a flat worth ₹12 crores in Delhi and is a director in several companies. \nAfter considering the case, the Court said that even if a wife is earning some income, it does not operate as a bar from being awarded maintenance by the husband. \nJustice Prasad observed that Omar Abdullah is a man of means, and has access to financial privilege that evades the common man. \nThe Court, however, also noted that even though Payal Abdullah is unemployed, she is not a complete destitute.\n\"This Court is of the view that in light of the financial capacity of the Respondent to provide a decent standard of living to his wife and children commensurate with his income and the standard of living that the Petitioners enjoyed previously, there is no reason that the maintenance amount awarded to Payal Abdullah should not be enhanced to that extent. Accordingly, this Court observes that there is limited merit in the instant petition and directs the interim maintenance amount to be increased from ₹75,000 per month to ₹1,50,000 per month for the petitioner.\"\nOn the issue of maintenance to the two sons, Court said that even though they are above the age of 18 years and, therefore, not entitled to maintenance, but Omar Abdullah cannot abandon them and abdicate his duties as a father. \n\"The period of compensation shall commence from the date when the children were enrolled in the law college, and shall subsist till their graduation from the law college....

A notice terminating the franchise agreement was served in September 2012 on DHCL, which was the cause of dispute between the two parties. \nThe arbitration proceedings were initiated thereafter by DHCL, for which the as the sole arbitrator. His award directing BCCI to pay over Rs 4,800 crores to DHCL has now been set aside by the High Court. \nBCCI's submission was that the agreement merely provided for types of breaches based on whether they could be cured or not and if either of the parties commits a breach which cannot be remedied, termination with notice was the only solution. It submitted that an occurrence of an \"insolvency event\" was an agreed reason of termination of the agreement. \nThe arbitrator had held that a show cause notice was necessary to the contract, however this was disputed by BCCI which stated that the agreement did not provide for show cause. Any notices sent prior to the termination notice were merely notices to remedy any curable breaches caused by DCHL.\nBCCI further submitted that as on September 14, 2012 there was a winding up petition petition pending against DCHL which gave rise to invocation of the termination clause of the agreement. \nOne of the arguments of DCHL was that termination was invalid as it was discriminatory against them in comparison to the other teams in the league.\nBCCI claimed they had no opportunity to meet this particular case, leading to a failure of natural justice and fair play as DCHL had no pleading.\nDCHL argued that it had substantially cured the defects pertaining to payment of players' fees and bank charges. Due to this reason, they claimed that the termination notice was premature.\nHaving considered the rival submission, documentary material and the decisions cited, the Court concluded that the arbitration award cannot be sustained.\nAt the broadest level, the court noted there were three defaults all of which continued and were not cured.\nThe Court observed that the certain portions in the award did not have reasons, certain other portions seemed to have ignored evidence and and in yet other portions \"wandered far from the contract\" by taking views which \"no reasonable person could have done\".\nIn doing so, it brushed aside objections about insufficient pleadings, and effectively rewarded the party in unquestionable breach of its contractual obligations, Justice Patel noted while setting aside the Award.\nSolicitor General Tushar Mehta with Advocates Samrat Sen, Kanu Agrawal, Indranil Deshmukh, Adarsh Saxena, R Shah and Kartik Prasad briefed by Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas represented BCCI.\nSenior Advocates Haresh Jagtiani, Navroz Seervai, Sharan Jagtiani with Advocates Yashpal Jain, Suprabh Jain, Ankit Pandey, Rishika Harish and Bhumika Chulani appeared for DCHL."}
{"ID": "id_405", "Summary": "The Kerala High Court recently held that the multiplier to be applied while calculating compensation in motor accident claim cases has to be decided on the basis of the age attained by the deceased/injured and not based on running age [PO Meera & Anr. v Ananda P Naik & Ors.]\nThus, the Court ruled that when a person aged 50 years and 7 months dies in a motor accident, the multiplier to be applied is the one applicable to the age bracket of 46-50 as laid down in Sarla Verma & Ors v Delhi Transport Corporation & Anr and not the one applicable to the age bracket of 51-55.\n\"The sine qua non to select the multiplier is the attainment of the specified age mentioned in the table and not the running of the age into the next group\", the single-judge Justice CS Dias held.\nPertinently, the Court also ruled that in matters relating to negligence in a motor accidents claim, if there is credible evidence including oral testimony, which contradicts the First Information Report (FIR) in establishing such negligence, the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal (MACT) may disregard the FIR.\nThe Court observed that while considering a claim petition under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, it is appropriate to decide negligence on the basis of preponderance of probability.\n\"A Fortiori, it is trite, a claim petition under Sec.166 of the Act has to be decided on the touchstone of preponderance of probability and not on the litmus test of beyond reasonable doubt,\" the Court said in its judgement.\nThe Court held the following:\n- Multiplier has to be determined based on the completed age and not the running age; \n- 10 percent enhancement has to be given every three years on the conventional heads every three years; \n- Minors income has to be fixed at Rs.30000 per annum with multiplier of 15; and \n- if there is evidence before MACT, information in FIR can be ignored.\nThe judgement was passed on appeals preferred against an award of the MACT for the death of one Madhavan and his minor daughter and the damages to the vehicle driven by Madhavan at the time of the accident. \nThe MACT allowed the claim petitions in part but found that Madhavan had also contributed to the accident. Hence, 50 percent of the compensation amount awarded in the three claim petitions was deducted. \nThis prompted the appellants to approach the High Court challenging the finding of contributory negligence and the quantum of compensation awarded. \nThe Court considered four main questions and found as follows:\n(i) Is the finding of the contributory negligence attributed against Madhavan sustainable in law?\nThe tribunal after rejecting the oral testimonies of prosecution witnesses on the ground that they were interested witnesses, had accepted the First Information Report in the case and concluded that the accident occurred due to the negligence of the drivers of both the vehicles.\nThe Court referred to the decision of the Supreme Court in National Insurance Company Ltd v. Chamundeswari & Ors, in which it was held that if any evidence which is recorded before the Tribunal runs contrary to the contents in the FIR, there is no reason to give weightage to the contents in the FIR.\nThereafter, the Kerala High Court had in Sampath M.P and Ors. v Binu & Ors. held that if the tribunal feels that the charge-sheet does not satisfy its judicial conscience, then the tribunal can record its reasons and call upon the parties to let in oral evidence.\nIn the instant case, the Court found that even though the police stated that the drivers of both the vehicles were negligent in causing the accident, relevant supporting materials were not appended to the charge-sheet relied on by the MACT. However, oral testimonies given by eye-witnesses stated that the accident occurred due to the negligence of the other driver.\nTherefore, the Court opined that the tribunal's finding of negligence on the part of Madhavan was erroneous and set aside the same. \n(ii) Is the multiplier of 11 adopted by the Tribunal in the claim seeking compensation for Madhavan's death correct?\nThe Court referred to the decision of the Supreme Court in Sarla Verma & Ors v Delhi Transport Corporation & Anr, which was later approved by a Constitution Bench in National Insurance Company Limited v. Pranay Sethi & Ors, which laid down the multiplier to be adopted of the deceased/injured person(s) falling in age group of 16 to 66 and above. \nThe multiplier set by the top court for the age group 46-50 years was '13' and for 51-55 years was '11'. \nOn the date of the accident, Madhavan had completed 50 years and 7 days. The MACT chose to use the multiplier '11'.\nHowever, the Court found from a reading of Sarla Verma that it is only when the deceased/injured completes the age of 51 years, that the multiplier would shift from ‘13’ to ‘11’ and not when the deceased/injured attains the age of 50 years and runs the said age till the previous night of his 51st birthday. \nHence, the Court set aside the finding of the tribunal in this regard, and adopted the multiplier of ‘13'.\n(iii) Is the quantum of compensation fixed for the death of Madhavan reasonable and just?\nOnce again, going by the law laid down in Sarla Verma and Pranay Sethi, and considering the fact that Madhavan was aged 50 years at the time of his death, the Court found that the appellants are entitled to future prospects @ 10% and refixed the compensation for loss of dependency accordingly. \nFurther, the Court ordered compensation for the dependents under the conventional heads viz., ‘funeral expenses’, ‘loss of estate’ and ‘loss of consortium’ to be enhanced by 10% every three years.\n(iv) Is the quantum of compensation fixed for the death of the minor daughter reasonable and just?\nThe tribunal had awarded compensation after fixing the monthly income of the 17 year old on a notional basis at ₹1,500 and adopting the multiplier of '15'.\nThe Court referred to the decision of the apex court in Kuruvan Ansari v Shyam Kishore Murmu & Anr which fixed the notional income of a ten year old child at ₹30,000 per annum and adopted the multiplier of '15'.\nAs the daughter was 17 years of age at the time of her death, the Court deemed it fit to fix her income notionally at ₹30,000 per annum and adopt the multiplier of 15 and accordingly re-calculated the compensation to be awarded. \nThe Court ordered the insurer to deposit the compensation amount, as fixed by the Court, before the tribunal within a period of sixty days."}

There is no corroboration to the testimony of complainant (journalist Ketan Tirodkar) and thus, I am not inclined to accept his uncorroborated version as his evidence is not inspiring confidence.\"\nThe case arose after the journalist, Ketan Tirodkar stood accused in a case under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA).\nHe was granted bail in the case but the bail order was challenged before the High Court.\nIt was Tirodkar's case that when he was in Delhi in May 2006, the accused Faraz Khan met him through a common friend. Khan allegedly told Tirodkar that he was the brother-in-law of one of the judges of the Delhi High Court. He further claimed that the Delhi High Court judge was a friend of the Bombay High Court judge who was to hear the plea challenging Tirodkar's bail. He even said that he had 'good contacts' with ministers in the Central government.\nTirodkar then allegedly requested Khan to arrange a good lawyer to represent him in the Bombay High Court, on a 'charity' basis.\nHowever, when Tirodkar returned to Mumbai, he claimed that Khan demanded ₹30 lakh from him. Shocked over the demand, Tirodkar asked Khan to call him on his MTNL phone so as to record the conversation. On this call, Khan reiterated the ₹30 lakh demand and allegedly instructed Tirodkar to arrange for two first class flight tickets and booking in a five-star hotel.\nSubsequently, Tirodkar made a written complaint to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and sought a probe into the matter.\nKhan raised doubts over the genuineness of the recorded conversation and the other contentions of Tirodkar. He pointed out that one of the prosecution witnesses had stated that Tirodkar himself had good contacts with several advocates who appear for litigants on charity. He argued that in view of this fact, there was no need for Tirodkar to seek contacts from him.\nIn its order, the Court doubted Tirodkar's contentions, opining,\n\"In the case in hand there is every doubt about the genuineness of the alleged conversation, transcription, collection of voice specimen, voice examination and forensic voice examination report as well as on the credibility of the testimony of the complainant and other witnesses.

{"ID": "id_41", "Summary": "The Delhi High Court recently passed an interim order restraining certain private parties (defendants) from using the “Khadi Organic” name and associated marks on a trademark infringement suit filed by the Khadi and Village Industries Commission (plaintiff) [Khadi and Village Industries Commission v. Ashish Singh and ors].\nJustice Sanjeev Narula passed the order on January 18 after being told that the defendants were misusing the goodwill and name of the Khadi Commission to secure donations and make fraudulent promises to supply “free Ram Mandir Prasad” on the payment of a delivery charge as well as Ram Mandir-related collectibles. \nThe Court opined that the defendants appeared to be attempting to monopolise the Ram Mandir consecration event “by preying on the public's religious beliefs and devotion” and by misusing the Khadi Commission’s goodwill. \nIt, therefore, directed the defendants to halt such operations, suspend their website, www.khadiorganic.com and take down social media posts on the supply of free “Ram Mandir Prasad” as well as merchandise associated with the Ram Mandir Pran Pratishta (consecration/ inaugural ceremony) of January 22.\nThe order was passed after the Court examined images of the defendants’ website and donation pages, which led the judge to arrive at a prima facie opinion that the defendants' “Khadi Organic” marks were deceptively similar to the “KHADI” trademark which is owned by the Khadi and Village Industries Commission.\nThe Khadi Commission also alleged that there were several posts by disgruntled customers who complained that they placed orders with the defendants for Ram Mandir-related merchandise but did not receive the same. The plaintiff’s counsel added that the Commission too placed such an order for such merchandise but did not receive the order.\nThe plaintiff argued that this indicated that the defendants had obtained money from customers on false promises and without providing a confirmation receipt or proof of dispatch of merchandise orders.\n“In these circumstances, the Court is convinced that the Plaintiff has been able to demonstrate a prima facie case in their favour and in case an ex-parte interim injunction is not granted, Plaintiff and will suffer an irreparable loss; balance of convenience also lies in favour of the Plaintiff and against Defendants No. 1 and 2. Defendants No. 1 and 2 and any person acting on their behalf are restrained from manufacturing, selling, offering for sale, exporting, advertising, directly or indirectly, any kind of goods and/or services under the marks “KHADI ORGANIC” or mark identical or deceptively similar to Plaintiff’s registered KHADI marks, which would amount to infringement or passing off of the Plaintiff’s KHADI marks,” the Court proceeded to order.\nThe Court was told that the defendants were asking for a delivery charge of ₹51 from Indian customers and 11 US dollars from foreign customers for the delivery of free \"Ram Mandir prasad.\"\nFurther, the defendants offered for sale various Ram Mandir-related merchandise, collectibles, food items, home temples, goods required to conduct religious ceremonies such as Gangajal, etc., through websites that bore the marks Khadi Earth and Khadi Organic.  \nSuch activities were marketed on platforms such as Instagram and Pinterest, the Court was told. The plaintiff-commission argued that the defendants had no right to misappropriate the KHADI mark and render a false impression that the plaintiff was affiliated with the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust which is organizing the consecration ceremony.\nIt was also submitted that several customers have posted videos and Instagram reels alleging that the defendant’s “free Prasad service” was a scam. The defendants, meanwhile, hosted a live session on YouTube on January 14, to clarify that it was a private initiative that was not overseen by the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust.\nThe same video also informed that as of January 14, nearly 20 lakh orders were received. After the Khadi Commission made further inquiries, it was found that one of the defendants had also filed a trademark application on January 13, 2024, to get rights over the mark “KHADI ORGANIC.”\nThe plaintiff, however, pointed out that it had successfully initiated action against the defendants in May 2022 and March 2023 before the World Intellectual Property Organization over the domain name www.khadiindia.us which was used to sell cosmetic products, clothing, home accessories etc. under the KHADI mark.\nAfter noting these submissions, the High Court passed an ex-parte interim order in the plaintiff’s favour.

{"ID": "id_410", "Summary": "The Punjab & Haryana High Court recently refused to quash a First Information Report (FIR) registered under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act on the basis of a compromise effected by the parents of the victim [Surinder Kumar v. State of Haryana].\nJustice Pankaj Jain found that an agreement entered into by a child or her parents that compromised the child's dignity could not be raised to a status where it defeated the very object of the Act.\n\"Parents cannot be allowed to compromise the dignity of a child by an agreement. Where ever and whenever in a society governed by rule of law the question will arise: who will protect from the protector? The only and obvious answer will be-LAW,\" the order stated.\nThe Court was hearing a plea filed to quash the FIR in the case on the ground that the accused had come to a compromise with the parents of the victim. The accused was charged under Sections 452 (house trespass after preparation for hurt, assault or wrong­ful restraint) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code, Section 3 of the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, and Section 8 (punishment for sexual assault) of the POCSO Act.\nEssentially, the question before the single judge was whether an FIR registered for offences punishable under the POCSO Act could be quashed on the basis of a compromise.\nDiscussing the aim of the POCSO Act in light of the Constitution, the Court stated it was the duty of the State to make sure children are not abused, and that their childhood and youth are protected against exploitation. \n\"The Preamble of the Act further declares sexual exploitation and sexual abuse of children as a heinous crime which need to be effectively addressed,\" the Court recorded. \nThe Court also cited the apex court judgment in State of Madhya Pradesh v. Laxmi Narayan and others, in which it was held that courts, before quashing proceedings in criminal cases had to consider the following:\n\"(i) Nature and effect of the offence on the conscious of the society; (ii) Seriousness of the injury, if any; (iii) Voluntary nature of compromise between the accused and the victim; & (iv) Conduct of the accused persons, prior to and after the occurrence of the purported offence and/or other relevant considerations.\"\nFinding that the offence in the present case was of a heinous nature, the Court found that it was not a fit case for quashing proceedings.\nIt was further held that the power under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) could not be exercised to defeat the purpose of an enactment which was brought into force in order to discharge a constitutional mandate and an obligation arising out of international conventions.\n“Children are human beings to whom respect is due, superior to us by reason of this innocence and of the greater possibilities of their future”, the order stated quoting Italian educator Maria Montessori.\nWith this, the Court refused to quash the FIR.

{"ID": "id_412", "Summary": "A division bench of Delhi High Court on Wednesday delivered a split verdict regarding criminalisation of marital rape [RIT Foundation v. Union of India].\nJustice C Hari Shankar who was one of the two judges on the bench ruled against criminalising marital rape and refused to strike down Exception 2 to Section 375 of Indian Penal Code which exempts non-consensual sex by a man with his wife from the ambit of rape. \nIn his judgment which run into nearly 200 pages, Justice Shankar said that any assumption that a wife forced to have sex with her husband feels the same degree of outrage as a woman raped by a stranger is not only unjustified but even unrealistic.\n“Any assumption that a wife, who is forced to have sex with her husband on a particular occasion when she does not want to, feels the same degree of outrage as a woman raped by a stranger, in my view, is not only unjustified, but is ex facie unrealistic,” he stated.\nA husband forcing his wife to have sex with him, despite her unwillingness is wrong, the judge said. \nHowever, when a woman decides to marry a man, she consciously and willingly enters into a relation in which sex is an integral part and the woman gives her husband the right to expect meaningful conjugal relations, Justice Shankar opined.\n\"If, therefore, the man, in such a situation, requests her, on a particular occasion to have sex, he is exercising a right that vests in him by marriage, and requests his wife to discharge an obligation which, too, devolves on her by marriage,\" the judgment said.\nThus, the same cannot be equated with that of rape by a stranger, it was held. \n“If the wife refuses, and the husband, nonetheless, has sex with her, howsoever one may disapprove the act, it cannot be equated with the act of ravishing by a stranger. Nor can the impact on the wife, in such a situation, be equated with the impact of a woman who is raped by a stranger,” the judgment stated. \nBy holding so, the judge disagreed with the view of the senior judge, Justice Rajiv Shakdher who said that conjugal expectations, though, legitimate during the subsistence of a joyful marriage, cannot be put at par with unbridled access and/or marital privilege claimed by the husband vis-a-vis his wife.\nJustice Hari Shankar further said that though the petitioners may say that a woman who is surviving in a marriage with her husband, with whom she has had sex one or more times against her will, would want to drag him to court for rape, it cannot even be assumed that this is perception reflects the views of the majority of Indian women.\n“Any such contention would, at the very least, be purely presumptive in nature. This aspect is important. As Mr Tushar Mehta, learned Solicitor General correctly submitted, the impugned Exception, and its evisceration from the statute book, are not issues of merely legal import; the issue has wide societal and sociological ramifications, which cannot be ignored. The perception of the teeming millenia of this country cannot, therefore, be regarded as an illegitimate consideration, while examining the need, or otherwise, to retain the impugned Exception in Section 375 of the IPC.”\nThe judgment said that marriage, as a sociological instrument, confers legitimacy to sexual activity between man and woman and one of the grassroot justifications for marriage is, unquestionably, the right to engage in sexual activity without social disapprobation.\nIntroducing into the marital relations the possibility of husband being regarded as wife’s rapist if he has sex with her without consent, would be completely antithetical to the very institution of marriage as understood in the country both in fact and in law, the judge said.\n“The daughter born of such an act would, if the petitioner’s submissions are to be accepted, be a product of rape. Though the child has been born out of wedlock, and out of a perfectly legitimate sexual act between her parents, she would be the child of a rapist because her mother was, on the occasion when she had sex with her father, been unwilling. Her father, as a rapist, would be liable to suffer the punishment stipulated in Section 376, were her mother to prosecute. The sequelae, were the submissions of the petitioners to be accepted, are mind boggling,” the judge further stated. \nJustice Hari Shankar further noted that sex between a husband and wife is sacred and it is because of this unique character and complexity of the institution of marriage that the legislature has felt that no allegation of rape has a place.\n“In no subsisting, surviving and healthy marriage should sex be a mere physical act, aimed at gratifying the gross senses. The emotional element of the act of sex, when performed between and wife and husband, is undeniable. The marital bedroom is inviolable. A legislation that seeks to keep out, from the parameters of such a relationship, any allegation of ‘rape’, in my view, is completely immune to interference.”\nThe judge said that the petitioners as well as amici curiae merely seek to propound what, in their view, should be the laws while they failed bring even an iota of material to show that act of sex by a husband with his wife, against her consent is, legally rape. \nHe added that the counsel completely failed to accord to the marital relationship the status and importance it deserved.\nMarriage, the counsel failed to take into account, is not a brick-and-mortar institution but an institution which epitomizes, at the highest level, the most sublime relationship that can exist between man and woman and decidedly, it is not an “imposed conception”, Justice Shankar held.\nJustice Shankar, therefore, said that the marital rape exception, far from being unconstitutional, serves a laudatory purpose, and is in pre-eminent public interest, aimed at preservation of the marital institution, on which the entire bedrock of society rests. \n\"Absent a subsisting and surviving marriage, neither would learned counsel have been here to argue the matter with the proficiency they exhibited, nor would we be here to pass judgement thereon,\" he said. \nRead more about the judgment here."}

{"ID": "id_419", "Summary": "The Jharkhand High Court recently quashed disciplinary proceedings initiated by the State Bar Council against a lawyer who allegedly was in an \"illicit\" physical relationship with his client [Vikash Kumar Dubey v. The Jharkhand State Bar Council].\nJustice Ananda Sen concluded that the complaint was filed with mala fide intentions to wreak vengeance on a professional lawyer who was defending the complainant’s wife in a matrimonial case. \nThe Court also ruled that the complainant had no locus standi to lodge the complaint since he had no professional relationship with the lawyer, Vikas Kumar Dubey (petitioner).\n“This sort of behaviour of respondent No. 3 [complainant] is absolutely deprecated,” the Court remarked.\nWhile challenging the disciplinary enquiry against him, Dubey had told the Court that he was representing the complainant’s wife in a matrimonial dispute. The complainant (client's estranged husband) had lodged the complaint only to prevent the lawyer from defending his wife, he added.\nHowever, counsel representing the complainant argued that there was serious misconduct on the part of Dubey and that he should appear before the Disciplinary Committee. \nCounsel representing the State Bar Council prayed for some time to respond. However, the Court rejected the request.\n“The role of the Bar Council is limited. They should act as a neutral body and they cannot take side of any of the parties. Thus, they need not be heard on the merit of the case. The Bar council can only make submission if their jurisdiction is challenged,” it observed. \nDealing with the case on merits, the Court noted that both the complainant and the petitioner were adults.\nIt also noted that the allegation of there being a physical relationship was levelled by the husband, who was not on good terms with his wife.\n“Surprisingly, the wife has not filed any complaint. If there was any sexual act or any misconduct committed by the petitioner-Advocate upon [her], [she] would have been the only person who could have lodged a complaint. In this case, it is the husband, who is adversary of [wife] has lodged the complaint,” the Court said.\nIt further noted that a summoning order in the criminal case filed against the petitioner by the complainant has already been quashed by the High Court.\nConsidering the overall facts, the Court found the complaint to be an act of vengeance against the lawyer and allowed his plea to quash the complaint.\n“Consequently, Notice Ref. No. 1688 of 2023 dated 26.8.2023 in D.C. Enquiry No. 3/2023 is quashed.

Ltd. (AWP), through consent terms.\n”There was a larger responsibility on the parties to disclose entire facts to court and suppression of facts has compelled the court to pass the order. Undeniably fraud was caused due to the consent terms filed. In these circumstances I am not in a position to accept any contention made by the parties. The consent decree is set aside,“ the Court ruled.\nIn October 2020, Adarsh Water Parks had obtained an order in the 2006 suit against a few persons. The firm had sought specific performance of an agreement which purportedly granted the firm development rights to the entire village of Kanjur. \nThe High Court had while disposing of the suit noted that the dispute had been settled by the parties.\nA year after this, in November, one Jolly Anil India Ltd. filed an interim application in the suit objecting to the decision of the High Court. The company claimed that they had been leased nearly 80 acres of land from the government.\nThe company added the State government as a party to their application after which the State came to know about the suit of 2006. \nIn their interim application, Maharashtra government claimed that AWP did not have any rights over 1,800 acres of land of the disputed land as it belonged to the State. It also claimed that the private firm had fraudulently obtained the decree in their favour in the 2006 suit as the firm deliberately did not arraign State government as a party to the suit. \nThe Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) filed its affidavit in support of the State’s application. The civic corporation stated that it had certain land parcels in its possession and that the private firm could not claim ownership over the same. \nThe State and Central governments had allotted land parcels admeasuring over 100 hectares to BMC to establish the Kanjurmarg dumping ground for solid waste as per Supreme Court directions, BMC claimed in its affidavit. \nIt added that of the 141 hectares, 23 hectares is mangrove land and as per the forest department’s decision, the State has retained the said area.

It argued that getting consent of 100 percent tenants is not always possible and, therefore, such a pre-condition was arbitrary. \nOn the other hand, MCGM said that the pre-condition was imposed only to secure the interests of all the tenants. \nThe bench referred to the guidelines issued by the MCGM for declaring private and municipal buildings as ‘C-1’ category (dangerous, unsafe) and also the DCPR-2034.\nIt noted that the same provides that if 51 per cent to 70 percent of the tenants consent and agree to accept permanent alternate accommodation (PAA) offered by the owner or landlord, the same would suffice and would entitle the developer to secure a CC.\n\"Thus, in our clear opinion, it was arbitrary for the MCGM to insist from the petitioners, consent of 100 per cent of the tenants and in its absence withhold the CC to be issued to the petitioners on few tenants not consenting to accept residential tenements,\" the bench held. \nThe bench opined that it cannot be countenanced that once the majority of the occupants agree to vacate the building and/or accept the PAA being offered by the owner, by protecting their occupancy rights as they stood at the time the building was demolished, it cannot be heard from minority of such tenants, for whatever reasons, that they are not agreeable to a settlement in this regard. \n\"They cannot now resist a PAA as offered by the owner to the majority of the tenants, for a reason that the PAA does not suit their requirements, or for some other reasons they are not agreeable to enter into a PAA, as in the present case.

{"ID": "id_438", "Summary": "The Delhi High Court recently held that a Will has to be looked at from the point of view of layman and all its clauses have to be harmoniously construed, given equal importance, benefit and uniformity [Vikrant Kapila & Anr v Pankaja Panda & Ors].\nA division bench of Justices Suresh Kumar Kait and Saurabh Banerjee said that clauses in a Will are like sailors on a ship sailing in the same direction where each clause has an individual value like each sailor on a ship has an individual role to play.\n\"In our opinion, for reaching a final culmination with respect to interpretation of a Will it is imperative for the Court to look at it from the eyes of a layman rather than a lawman,\" the Court said.\nThe Court noted that disputes regarding interpretation of a Will have been knocking the legal doors since time immemorial and though such doors have been successfully closed through numerous pronouncements, but unfortunately the issue will always be burning as there can be no closure to it.\n“As per basic settled principles of law, it is the foremost duty of the Court to carefully give a purposeful meaning to the words and logical interpretation to the language of a Will to infer and draw the real intention of the testator. As meaning is sought to be given to the intention of the testator to what he must’ve meant, when he was alive, after his demise, due importance has to be given to the surrounding circumstances, the background, the status and relations with the family and society of the testator,” the bench said.\nThe Court further stated that it has to look behind the cloak and lift the veil and that its purpose must be to derive the real intention of the testator and recognize the dispositive rights of the beneficiaries for reaching a conclusion as far as practically possible.\nIt has to be kept in mind that when some clause(s) in the Will are or can be overstepping on each other and as the same cannot be altered or no explanation can be sought from the testator, it should be made sure that such clause(s) do not trample upon each other so as to negate any one of them, the Court added. \n“In case the clause(s) are inconsistent and a divergent meaning is possible, the order of precedence should be followed, i.e., the more powerful/meaningful clause(s) is to take precedence over the less meaningful clause(s). When there is a clause bequeathing absolute rights then the same cannot be followed by other clause(s) with restricted rights. An absolute right is an outright recognition which cannot be fettered by imposing a condition in the form of a restrictive right,” the judgment said. \nThe bench held that where words in a clause can be interpreted in more than one way, it would be in the interest of things to choose and give the best possible, plausible, constructive meaning in the overall interest of everybody so as to draw a ‘single straight line’ with no breakers rather than falling back on something which is implausibly destructive against the interest of everybody.\n“In such situations, the meaning which furthers the cause ought to be chosen rather than which goes against the cause. The Court steps into the shoes of a kapellmeister and at the end of the day as everybody likes a melodious song, it is the duty of the Court to choose the music which is ears to the soul. Word(s) and clause(s) of the same Will ought not be picked or chosen out of context,” the bench said.\nIt added that all words are to be regarded as essential and all the clauses should be reconciled with each other and are to be read together as being part and parcel of the same document.\nHowever, if for some reason it is not possible to do the same, then the more beneficial interpretation should be adopted so as to bring a hiatus to the conflicting situation, the bench clarified.\nThe bench was dealing with an appeal challenging the judgement and preliminary decree by a single-judge based upon the Will of one Sheila Kapila which demarcated 25% equal share to all her children and then put the same to sale and distributed the proceeds amongst them.\nDispute arose as Sheila Kapila’s son died and left a Will bequeathing all his estate to his second and nothing to his two children. They filed an appeal stating that as per Sheila Kapila’s Will, her four children have a limited bequest whereas they, like other grand-children of the testator, have an absolute bequest.\nAt the outset, the judges said that, \n“A Will will be a Will only when it will lay to rest the wishes of who is at rest,” and that it will be their endeavour to proceed so that the \"will of who lays at rest is put to rest\".\nAfter considering the submissions, the bench held that there is nothing cryptic or vague about the words or language used in the Will and that there is an absolute bequest in favour of the four children.\n“Finding no infirmity, perversity or illegality in the Impugned Judgment dated 10.05.2022 passed by the Learned Single Judge qua the interpretation of the Will in question, we find there are no grounds of interference by this Court.”\nTherefore, the appeals were disposed of.\nSenior Advocate Sudhanshu Batra with advocates Gagan Mathur, Madhu Sehgal and Rishi Sehgal appeared for the appellants.\nRespondents were represented through Senior Advocates Ashish Dholakia and Arvind Nigam along with advocates Jai Sahai Endlaw, Ashish Kumar, Niharika Ahluwalia, Ishita Deswal, Astha Badoriya and Mansi Sharma."}

This was after the counsel requested that he is at the forefront of the fight against COVID-19. \nThe four leaders were arrested on May 17 for their alleged involvement in the Narada scam. \nThe interim bail granted by a lower to the four by a subordinate court on Monday was stayed by the High Court in an evening hearing, the order being pronounced after 10 pm the same day.\nThe stay was granted after the CBI sought a transfer of the case from the Court dealing with the same, while also citing a threat to the probe agency on the ground that TMC leader and West Bengal Chief Minister, Mamata Banerjee and TMC ministers were sitting in dharna outside the agency's office which the CBI allegd was causing obstruction of justice and creating an atmosphere of fear. \nThe CBI had also alleged that the State Law minister along with his supporters had thronged the special court complex which heard the bail plea of the four leaders."}

{"ID": "id_443", "Summary": "The Delhi High Court recently quashed an order of a family court that rejected a woman's plea to cross examine her husband in a matrimonial dispute . [Chetna Rathee vs Chahit Kundu]\nJustice Rekha Palli observed that while matrimonial matters are to be decided expeditiously, family courts should not hurriedly close the right of the parties to cross examine by adopting an overly technical approach.\n\"In matters like the present when the Court is dealing with petitions pertaining to Family Law, where the parties are already at loggerheads with each other, even though the matters are required to be decided expeditiously, the Court is expected to not adopt such a hyper-technical approach and close the right of the parties to cross examine in such a hurried manner,\" the Court said.\nThe woman argued that the family court's order was passed without proper consideration of the fact that she was only given a single opportunity to cross-examine her husband. \nOn the day of the cross-examination, her counsel requested more time as they had not been provided with a copy of her husband's evidence by way of an affidavit.\nFurther, her counsel on the day of cross examination was to appear before the High Court in another case and had therefore, sought an adjournment, which was denied without any justifiable reason. \nHer application seeking permission to cross examine her husband, moved on the very same day, was rejected by the family court. \nThis compelled her to move an application seeking restoration of her right to cross examine her husband, which was also rejected.\nOn the other hand, the respondent-husband supported the challenged order, asserting that the petitioner had been presenting contradictory arguments before the family court. He also highlighted the defiant attitude of the petitioner's counsel. In light of these factors, the respondent argued that the court's decision to reject the application was justified.\nHe further claimed that a copy of the evidence was sent to the registered email ID of the petitioner's counsel and therefore, his plea that a copy of the same was not available with him was rightly rejected. He, therefore, sought rejection of the petition.\nThe High Court took the view that even if the plea of the petitioner's counsel about not having received the evidence or of being busy in a matter before the High Court was discarded, the family court should have considered the grave and irreparable prejudice that would be caused to the petitioner by closing her right to cross examine her husband, who was the most crucial witness in the case.\nTherefore, the Court allowed the plea, setting aside the assailed order subject to a payment of ₹25,000 as costs for the inconvenience caused to the respondent and directed the petitioner to cross-examine the respondent on the next date of hearing in the Family Court.\nAdvocates Prateek Goswami, Neeraj Gupta and Rajat Asija appeared for the petitioner while the respondent was represented by advocate Shailender Dahiya."}
{"ID": "id_444", "Summary": "The Patna High Court recently set aside the death penalty awarded to a man for the murder and rape of a 12-year-old girl, after finding that the prosecution’s entire case rested only on the fact that a sniffer dog had entered the accused man's house [The State of Bihar v. Amar Kumar].\nThe division bench of Justices Ashutosh Kumar and Alok Kumar Pandey slammed the trial court for the way it had handled the case and sentenced the accused to death “without caring for the basic principles of the law.\"\nThe Court opined that the judicial dispensation “can ill-afford” such heavy reliance on the expertise of a sniffer dog.\nThe Court demanded how the trial court could have presumed that the dog would not have made a mistake in entering the house of the accused, considering the fact that there was evidence of it having entered another person’s house as well.\nThe Court acknowledged the advantages of the olfactory sense (sense of smell) of the dogs and the assistance sniffer dogs provide to cops. \nHowever, it held that even if a sniffer dog’s assistance could be a starting point for the police probe, it cannot be received “as an evidence so strong as for the trial court not to need any corroborative evidence.\"\n“This (sniffer dog evidence) cannot be an evidence, much less strong evidence unless the Court examines the reliability of the dog skills, its past patterns of performance or its handler’s capabilities. It cannot ever be taken as a reliable pointer towards the commission of an offence at the hands of an offender,\" the Court added. \nIn the case dating back to 2019, the minor girl was gang raped and murdered near a temple when she along with her grandmother went to witness a fair organised on the occasion of the Nagpanchami festival.\nA day later, when the dead body of the victim was found, the Police brought in a sniffer dog who is stated to have first smelled the dead body and then moved into a villager’s house. \nAfter nothing incriminating was found there, the dog entered the house of the accused. The accused was arrested after he was allegedly found locked inside his room. The door had to be forced open following which he was apprehended by the Police, the Court was told. \nAfter investigation, the accused was chargesheeted under provisions pertaining to the offences of murder and gang rape. In October 2021, the trial court convicted him and sentenced him to be hanged by the neck till death. He moved an appeal before the High Court challenging this verdict.\nAfter examining other evidence against the accused, the Court noted that four pairs of slippers, a purse and a chain had been found at the place where the dead body was recovered.\nIt said that the investigating agency “jumped to the conclusion” that one of the slippers belonged to the accused. From his house, a pair of soiled jeans was also recovered, which the Court said was “surprisingly” never sent for any forensic examination.\n“We also do not find any record of the appellant having been put to medical test under Section 53A of the Code of Criminal Procedure. May be for these reasons, the appellant was granted bail during the investigation by the High Court,” it added.\nThe Court censured the trial court for convicting the accused on the basis of such evidence, and opined that the circumstances in the case are “either no circumstances in the eyes of law” or are factually incorrect.\nOn delving deeper into the evidence, the Court found nothing on record to prove that the slippers found near the dead body belonged to the accused or that he had worn them on the date of occurrence. \nOn the blood droplets stated to have been seen on the dead body, the Court noted that there was no reference to it in the inquest report prepared on the spot. \nThe Court also took a critical view of the trial court’s reliance on the recovery of jeans and said that the trial court “perhaps forgot” that nobody had identified or confirmed that the dress was worn by the accused to the fair. \n“In fact, one of the witnesses to the seizure list has specifically stated that only the appellant was arrested from his house after the sniffer dog had entered, but nothing else was recovered from that place. The witnesses to the seizure have, in unison, stated that they had signed on a plain piece of paper,” the judgement read.\nAfter looking into the post-mortem report, the Court also expressed doubt over whether the dead body examined by the doctor belonged to the victim in this case as the report did not make mention of any examination of the victim's genitalia.\n“We say so for the reasons that normally in a case of suspected rape/ rape, the first and foremost effort of the Doctor is to examine the genitals. No injury was found on the entire body of the deceased,” the High Court explained.\nThe Court also rejected the prosecution's arguments on the guilt of the accused based on him being found locked inside a room at the time of arrest. \n“Even if the appellant were found inside the room, it would be absolutely naive to give any hard and fast rule having any universal application, with regard to reaction of a person in a given circumstance,” the Court opined.\nIn view of the above, High Court set aside the conviction and declined to confirm the death penalty.\nAfter the counsel representing the appellant said that he was in jail, the High Court also ordered his immediate release.\nAdvocate Krishna Chandra represented the appellant (accused).\nAdditional Public Prosecutor Abhimanyu Sharma represented the State."}
{"ID": "id_446", "Summary": "The Supreme Court on Monday dismissed the pleas moved for the release of Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) minister V Senthil Balaji who was arrested last June in a money laundering case being probed by the Enforcement Directorate. [V Senthil Balaji vs State Represented by Deputy Director and ors]\nA bench of Justices AS Bopanna and MM Sundresh also granted the Enforcement Directorate (ED) custody of Balaji for five days until August 12.\nThe Court also clarified that the period spent by Balaji for medical treatment at a hospital after his arrest cannot be included in the period of ED custody. \n\"Admittedly, physical custody has not been given to the respondents (ED) ... An investigating agency is expected to be given a reasonable freedom to do its part. To say that the respondents ought to have examined the appellant in the hospital, and that too with the permission of the doctors, can never be termed as an adequate compliance,\" the Court held.\nThe order was passed on two pleas moved by Balaji and his wife. A connected plea moved by the ED was also heard along with the pleas for Balaji's release. \nThe Madras High Court had earlier ruled against releasing the minister prompting Balaji and his wife, S Megala to move the apex court.\nMeanwhile, the ED had also moved the top court contending that the High Court had erred in even entertaining a habeas corpus petition filed by Balaji's wife after his remand. The ED's plea was heard along with the pleas filed by Balaji and his wife.\nThe Supreme Court ruled that there was no cause for filing the Habeas Corpus petition since, by that time, Balaji had been duly produced before a Sessions Judge in compliance with Section 19 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) of 2002. \n\"Despite additional grounds having been raised, they being an afterthought, we have no hesitation in holding that the only remedy open to the appellant is to approach the appropriate Court under the Statute. This was obviously not done. We may also note that the appellant was very conscious about his rights and that is the reason why, by way of an application he even opposed the remand,\" the Court added. \nThe Court proceeded to rule against the release of Senthil Balaji. The Court further summarised its conclusions as follows:\ni. When an arrestee is forwarded to the jurisdictional Magistrate under Section 19(3) of the PMLA, 2002 no writ of Habeas Corpus would lie. Any plea of illegal arrest is to be made before such Magistrate since custody becomes judicial.\nii. Any non-compliance of the mandate of Section 19 of the PMLA, 2002 would enure to the benefit of the person arrested. For such noncompliance, the Competent Court shall have the power to initiate action under Section 62 of the PMLA, 2002.\niii. An order of remand has to be challenged only before a higher forum as provided under the CrPC, 1973 when it depicts a due application of mind both on merit and compliance of Section 167(2) of the CrPC, 1973 read with Section 19 of the PMLA 2002.\niv. Section 41A of the CrPC, 1973 has got no application to an arrest made under the PMLA 2002.\nv. The maximum period of 15 days of police custody is meant to be applied to the entire period of investigation – 60 or 90 days, as a whole.\nvi. The words “such custody” occurring in Section 167(2) of the CrPC, 1973 would include not only a police custody but also that of other investigating agencies.\nvii. The word “custody” under Section 167(2) of the CrPC, 1973 shall mean actual custody.\nviii. Curtailment of 15 days of police custody by any extraneous circumstances, act of God, an order of Court not being the handy work of investigating agency would not act as a restriction.\nix. Section 167 of the CrPC, 1973 is a bridge between liberty and investigation performing a fine balancing act.\nx. The decision of this Court in Anupam J. Kulkarni (supra), as followed subsequently requires reconsideration by a reference to a larger Bench.\nThe case against Balaji stems from alleged irregularities in the appointment of bus conductors in the Tamil Nadu transport department, as well as the appointment of drivers and junior engineers.\nThese appointments were made during Balaji's tenure as the Transport Minister in the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) government between 2011 and 2015. Balaji later joined the DMK in 2018.\nFollowing his remand by a sessions court, Balaji was placed under judicial custody. However, instead of being sent to prison, he was eventually transferred to a private hospital where he underwent bypass surgery.\nMeanwhile, his wife filed a habeas corpus petition before the High Court seeking his release. After a division bench of the High Court delivered a split verdict on this plea, a third judge was appointed to decide on the matter. The third judge eventually ruled against Balaji's release.\nSolicitor General Tushar Mehta appeared for the ED before the Supreme Court.\nBalaji and his wife were represented by Senior Counsel Kapil Sibal and Mukul Rohatgi and advocate Misha Rohatgi."}

A person or political personality cannot claim security on the ground that he faces threats from his enemies because of some private dispute with them\", the Court added.\nThe Court further observed that if there is no 'real threat' to the individual then it would not be proper for the government to grant security at the cost of taxpayers' money to create a privileged class. \n\"In a democratic country governed by rule of law and written Constitution providing security at State expense ought not to become an act of patronage to create a coterie of ‘obliged’ and ‘loyal’ persons.\" the Court noted\nIt clarified, however, that there could not be any dispute about the security granted for the President, Vice-President and Prime Minister, Union Ministers, State Chief Ministers and Judges of the Supreme Court and High Courts, since they represent the core functioning and authority of the Indian State.\nThe Court proceeded to dismiss the lawyer's plea for personal security as lacking merit. \nSecurity should not be provided merely to enhance one's status: Allahabad High Court declines to grant personal security to Lawyerreports @Areebuddin14 Read More: https://t.co/BSZFco9LgP pic.twitter.com/UKImBYpKfL"}

There was urgency in the portal to be finalized and implemented looking to the pandemic and dire need of unorganized workers to receive the benefit. The attitude of Ministry of Labour and Employment in not completing the module even though directed as early as on August 21, 2018 shows that Ministry is not alive to the concern of the migrant workers and the non-action of the Ministry is strongly disapproved,\" the Court said. \nIt, therefore, directed the Central government to develop a web portal in consultation with National Informatics Centre to register unorganized and migrant workers. \nThe same has to be done by July 31, 2021, the Court added. \nThe order was passed in a suo motu case concerning welfare of migrant workers amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe following directions were passed by the Court:\n- All state governments to formulate schemes to provide dry rations to all migrant workers who do not possess ration cards till such time the COVID 19 pandemic is on. Central government to allocate grains to states for the schemes.\n- Community kitchens to be run by all states and continue till pandemic is on.\n- Central government to undertake exercise to re-determine the total coverage under National Food Security Act for giving ration cards. This will benefit large number of persons as more than 10 years have elapsed since the state-wise coverage was determined.\n- All states to implement one nation one ration scheme.\n- Centre and states to complete registration of all migrant workers and those in unorganised sector by December 2021.\nThe judgment came after activists Harsh Mander, Anjali Bhardwaj and Jagdeep Chhokar moved an urgent application before the Supreme Court seeking directions to ensure the migrant and stranded labourers are not deprived of ration and food security and are able to travel back to their homes at nominal cost.\nDuring the hearings, the Court had questioned the Central government as to why the National Database of Unorganised Workers was not ready despite its orders calling for the preparation of the same.\nThe Court had noted that about Rs. 417 crore had been disbursed for the making of the Database and expressed its displeasure at the snail's pace in which the work on the same was progressing.\n\"What is your project for National Database of Unorganised Workers? 417 crore has been released but not even a module is created.

The Managing Director, The Development Credit Bank Ltd].\nJustice KS Hemalekha explained that the credit of money from foreign sources is always subject to clearance from the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA).\n“Mere possession of the permanent registration under the FCRA, 2010 does not permit the petitioner to get the amounts credited to the designated savings bank account, which is always subject to the clearance of the Ministry of Affairs,” said the Court.\nThe Court took note of a Government of India letter, as per which the authorities can take a decision to place a foreign donor into a ‘Prior Reference/Permission Category’ on the basis of feedback or inputs received from the field or security agencies.\nThe observations were made by the Court in its decision on a petition filed by the Manasa Centre For Development And Social Action, a Bengaluru-based registered society that had sought the release of funds kept aside by the Development Credit Bank in 2013.\nManasa submitted that the bank had dishonoured a cheque citing insufficient funds even though there were sufficient funds in its account.\nThe bank had intimated that an amount of over ₹29 lakh has been kept aside and that any remittance being received from a foreign entity, ‘Dan Church Aid’, could only be credited to the account after receiving clearance from the MHA. \nHowever, Manasa claimed that the funds in the account were also from other agencies.\nThe Court noted that in 2013, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), on the basis of a communication from the MHA, had directed all the banks to ensure that any fund flow to any individual or entity in India from ‘Dan Church Aid’ is brought to the notice of the ministry before clearance.  \nManasa had received two inward remittances from the ‘Dan Church Aid’ in their account at Bengaluru.

{"ID": "id_452", "Summary": "A special court in Tamil Nadu recently dismissed the statutory bail application filed by Ankit Tiwari, an officer of the Enforcement Directorate (ED) who was arrested in December last year by the Tamil Nadu Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption (DVAC) following allegations of bribery.\nIn an order passed on February 6, J Mohana ML, Special Judge for Prevention of Corruption Case, Dindigul, rejected Tiwari’s application seeking statutory bail.\nThe special judge accepted the DVAC’s argument that Tiwari was not eligible for statutory bail despite the fact that the probe agency had been unable to file a chargesheet in the case so far. \nThe judge said that such delay in completing its investigation and filing of chargesheet occurred because the Supreme Court had temporarily stayed the investigation in the case on January 25 when the DVAC was 55 days into its probe\n“Considering the arguments on both side, the statutory bail u/s.167(2) Cr.P.C. would be applicable only if the sixty days period from the date of arrest had gone without any reasonable cause After the 55th day the respondent is restraint by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India from going for further investigation. Hence, the further proceedings is stalled. Hence, the reason and argument on the side of respondent Vigilance and Anti-Corruption, Dindigul seemed to this court is valid. Hence, this petition by the petitioner is dismissed,” the Dindigul Court said in its order.\nTiwari was arrested by the DVAC after allegedly having been caught accepting a bribe of ₹20 lakh.\nThis is the second instance of bail being denied to Tiwari. A TN court as well as the Madras High Court had dismissed his bail plea earlier in December 2023. \nMeanwhile, the ED had approached the Supreme Court seeking transfer of the probe into the matter to the Central Bureau of Investigation.\nThe Supreme Court had issued notice on that plea on January 25 and also stayed the probe by DVAC."}

It deprecated the inaction in this regard. \nOn April 7, 2016, one Phoolmati (petitioner) was refused treatment in absence of the Mamta card which had been introduced to benefit pregnant women. She later delivered the children on the road. \nWhile one of them died on the way to hospital, the other one died for want of medical attention. \nShe moved the High Court in 2016 seeking action against the erring health staff and effective implementation of various schemes meant for pregnant women.\nThe Court at the outset noted that cluster of schemes National Maternity Benefit Scheme (NMBS), National Family Benefit Scheme (NFBS), National Rural Health Mission (NRHM), Janani Suraksha Yojna (JSY), Janani Shishu Suraksha Karyakaram (JSSK) have been framed by the Government of India to reduce infant and maternal mortality.\n“In spite of having the aforementioned several beneficial Scheme for the welfare of pregnant females and infants, the respondents have miserably failed to discharge their duties in providing the benefits of these Schemes to the petitioner and her newly born infants,” it observed.\nOn Centre’s role in implementation of the schemes, the Court said the Government of India was escaping from its liability only on a technical ground that health is a state subject. \nRight to health is a national campaign initiated by the Central government and responsibility for maintaining good health must rest squarely on the shoulders of the Union of India, the Court underscored. \n“It is rather unfortunate that now the Union of India is treating the subject ‘Health’ as a public health issue and making it the concern of the State Governments. This is simply not permissible and appears to be a case of passing the buck,” Justice Dhand remarked. \nThough the Court also acknowledged that implementation of the schemes rests on State, it stressed that Union’s cooperation with the State government is indispensable to the success of such programmes.\nIn the given structure of cooperative federalism, the Union of India cannot confine its obligation to mere enactment of a scheme without ensuring its realisation and implementation, the Court said. \nThe Court also commented on the duty of medical professionals to extend assistance for preserving life. \nIn the present case, it found there was gross negligence and failure. \n“Therefore, on account of denial to provide the minimum benefits of the aforementioned Schemes to the petitioner, the Union of India and the State Government would be jointly and severely liable to pay her compensation in the sum of ₹4 Lakhs within a period of three months,” ordered the Court.\nHowever, the Court clarified that the amount will be deposited in a fixed deposit for a period of three years and interest accrued will be transferred to Phoolmati’s account every quarter. \nThe petitioner would be able to encash the fixed deposit only after the completion of the period of three years, it added.\nIn addition, the Court also ordered payment of ₹25,000 to the petitioner within a period of three months.\nWith regard to her prayer for effective implementation of the schemes, the Court directed the Union of India and Government of Rajasthan to address the shortcomings by constituting a Joint High Powered Committee.\nThe Court also passed the various directions including directions for increasing the cash amount given to the pregnant women before and after delivery.\nAdvocate Sudhindra Kumawat represented the petitioner.\nAdditional Solicitor General RD Rastogi and Advocate CS Sinha represented Union of India.\nAdditional Government Counsel Bharat Saini represented the State of Rajasthan."}

Poonia]\nThe division bench of Chief Justice Ravi Malimath and Justice Vishal Mishra imposed a fine of ₹4,000 on Dr NS Poonia and ordered that in case of failure to pay, he will undergo a simple imprisonment of ten days. \n\"He is further warned to remain cautious in future,\" the Court said further.\nThe Court said comments made by Poonia were not in the nature of “mere fair and dispassioned critique” of the judgments delivered by the judges but “are couched in intemperate language with use of undesirable expletives”.\nIt noted that an accusation against Poonia is that he had expressed that a judge deserves to be impeached for his overall performance as “the rights of the public have been demolished and humiliated.” \n“Thus, it was a deliberate attempt made by the respondent-contemnor to scandalize the image of the court which clearly falls under the definition of ‘criminal contempt’ under Section 2 (c) of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971,” the Court said.\nPoonia was found guilty not just for the comments made in his publication but also for “contemptuous comments” in the documents filed by him in the contempt case. A separate contempt petition had been registered in 2018 with regard to those documents. \nPoonia, who is the founder, editor and publisher of the journal titled ‘Lost Justice’, is bed-ridden and has paralysis in the right arm and right leg.

{"ID": "id_456", "Summary": "The Karnataka High Court on Wednesday set aside orders issued by National Law School of India University (NLSIU), Bangalore denying a law student admission to the next academic year on account of failing in a subject. \nNLSIU had awarded an 'F' grade to the student on the ground that he had plagiarized a project. \nWhile setting aside the orders, the Bench of Justice Krishna S Dixit was of the view that an opportunity of personal hearing ought to have been given to the petitioner.\nThe petitioner, the son of sitting Karnataka High Court judge Justice PB Bajanthri, was awarded an “F Grade” in the Child Rights Law examination held on March 13 because of alleged plagiarism in his project work. \nFurther, he was not allowed to take the Special Repeat Examination of the third trimester for promotion to the fourth year. Aggrieved by these decisions, the petiitoner approached High Court. \nNLSIU filed its Statement of Objections on October 17, claiming that the petitioner himself had admitted the case of plagiarism via an email.\nAfter hearing the parties, the Court firstly referred to Clause 4 of Regulation III of the BA LL.B (Hons) Academic and Examinations Regulations of 2009, which prescribed the procedure for dealing with cases of plagiarism. The Court noted that the said regulations did not define plagiarism and therefore, opined that the term needs to be understood in common parlance. \nThough the Court accepted that plagiarism is a very serious matter, it observed that there was no material on record to show that the subject teacher found evidence of plagiarism. Further, the teacher did not refer the matter in writing to the Chairman of the University Grants Commission (UGC), as is required under the aforementioned examination regulations. \nIn fact, the petitioner came to know of the alleged plagiarism only when he enquired about the same with the Registry of the University, after his exam result was not announced, the Court noted. Taking a dim view of the University's conduct, the Bench stated in its order,\n\"...this act of the University constitutes a grave error apparent on the face of the record....The entire episode of so called ‘plagiarism’ is framed on the basis of a few notoriously cryptic mails exchanged between the Course Teacher and the Exam Department, detrimentally keeping the petitioner in darkness...\"\nReferring to the email sent by the petitioner to the University, the Court noted that there were a few stray sentences such as ‘This is my first plagiarism violation'. However, the Court observed that such stray sentences could not be deemed to be evidence of the student's admission of plagiarism.\n\"....it is more so when one is dealing with the educational career of young minds like the petitioner herein; loose & lavish wording of the representations, need to be given a due discount; the respondent –University is not justified in seeking shelter under a leaking umbrella of a poor student.\"\nThis apart, the Court criticised the \"enormity of unfair treatment which the petitioner was meted out at the hands of a Law University\". Justice Dixit also lamented the fact that the the University did not afford an opportunity of personal hearing to the petitioner despite his written request on March 2.\n\"....in Biblical literature, even God is said to have given an opportunity of hearing to Adam & Eve before punishing them for consuming the proscribed fruit, in the Eden Garden; which heavens would have fallen down, had a reasonable opportunity of personal hearing been afforded, remains as a mystery rapped in enigma; after all, procedural fairness is a constitutional mandate when the answering respondent is an instrumentality of the “State” under Article 12 of the Constitution; it is high time that this University of national repute be reminded that it is dealing with our children and not others’ chattel...\"\nKarnataka High Court\nBased on these observations, the Court quashed the orders passed by NLSIU. The order concludes,\n\"...a Writ of Mandamus issues to the respondent-University to assess and award marks to the petitioner’s Project Work in question; petitioner shall be continued to keep the term by way of carry over/carry forward, disregarding the attendance shortage, if any.\""}

{"ID": "id_460", "Summary": "The Supreme Court on Wednesday rejected a plea filed by the ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist) in Kerala seeking permission to withdraw cases against its leaders for vandalism in the Kerala Assembly in 2015, when it was in opposition.\nThe Court ruled that the act of the accused MLAs crossed constitutional limits and will, therefore, not be covered under the immunity granted to law makers by the Constitution from criminal prosecution for acts done on the floor of the house.\n\"Committing destruction of property in the assembly cannot be equated to freedom of speech in the house. Allowing withdrawal of cases under these circumstances would amount to interference with normal course of justice for illegitimate reasons,\" the Court held. \nIt ruled that the immunity conferred on MPs/ MLAs is to help them discharge their functions without fear or favour but it is not a mark of status which makes them stand on a higher footing as compared to other citizens.\n\"Privileges and immunity is not a gate to claim exemption from criminal law and that would be a betrayal to the citizens. Immunity of members from criminal law is for the purpose of enabling them to perform functions without hindrance, fear or favour. Members are required to stay true to their oath and immunity is to help them discharge their functions freely. Privileges and immunity is not a mark of status which makes them stand on an unequal footing,\" the Court said. \nThe Court, therefore, upheld that Kerala High Court judgment stating that the High Court has correctly held that admissibility of evidence etc will be looked into by the trial court. \n\"We hold there is no merit in the appeals by the Kerala government,\" the Court concluded.\nThe judgment was delivered by a Bench of Justices DY Chandrachud and MR Shah on a petition against a March 12, 2021 order of the Kerala High Court which had dismissed the State's petition against an order of rejection by the Chief Judicial Magistrate's Court at Thiruvananthapuram, seeking permission to withdraw prosecution against accused including sitting ministers.\nThe State government said in its petition that the case was registered without the sanction of the speaker of the house for an incident which occurred while the assembly was in session. \nThe plea contended that the High Court failed to appreciate that the alleged incident had occurred while the assembly was in session and no crime could have been registered against the MLAs without previous sanction of the Speaker of the House for an incident that happened on the floor of the House.\n\"The FIR registered by the Secretary Legislative Assembly without the consent of the Speaker is wrong...the act of the accused persons being in relation to their function to protest as members of the legislative assembly the MLA’s who are accused in this FIR had entitled to get protection under the Constitution,\" the petition said.\nIn this regard, the State also highlighted Articles 105(3) and 194(3) of the Constitution of India which confers certain privileges and immunities on the members of the parliament and State legislature.\n\"Therefore it not proper to the Secretary of Legislative Assembly to file cases against MLAs with regard to an incident that happened on the floor of the House during the protest made by the opposition members,\" the plea emphasised.\nThe appeal further stated that the question involved is with regard to the interpretation of Section 321 of the Code of Criminal Procedure which gives powers to the prosecutor to file an application for withdrawal of a case.\n\"This Hon’ble Court settled the proposition of law on this aspect in a number of decisions. What can be look into by the court whether the public prosecutor had filed the application for withdrawal in good faith after independently analysing the whole situation and whether the withdrawal of the cases will help the ends of justice,\" the appeal said.\nHowever, the Court during the hearing of the case, had stated that the behaviour by public servants which involved throwing microphone and causing damage to public property, should be met with legal action.\nPrima facie we have to take a strict view of this kind of behavior. This is not acceptable behavior. Look at the behaviour of MLA who throws mic on the floor of the house. He must face trial,\" said Justice Chandrachud.\nThe Court had also remarked this case was \"not about theft but damage to public property and that the government is the custodian of this property.\"\nJustice Chandrachud had further observed,\n\"Let us take example of court. Even in court, lawyers sometime lose their cool and oppose each other. But will that justify destroying court property?\"\nThe Kerala High Court in its order had noted that question was whether the acts allegedly committed by the accused, which, if proven, would be offences punishable under the Indian Penal Code, are to be reckoned as part of the proceedings of the House, for the purpose of their protection.\n\"The answer can only be in the negative, since privileges and immunities are provided to ensure smooth functioning of the House by guaranteeing absolute freedom to the members to speak and participate in its deliberations. Here the allegation is of the functioning of the Assembly Session having been disrupted by the members by trespassing into the Speakers Dias and committing mischief.

The relevant prayer sought a direction to the Centre to establish an NGT Bench in the State.\nIt was stated that the NGT had Circuit Benches at Jodhpur, Shimla and Shillong. The petitioner called for a Bench to be established at Ahmedabad since any litigation relating to the environment in Gujarat falling under the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 had to be taken to Pune, which was approximately 700 km away. Therefore, it was very difficult for the people of Gujarat to travel all the way and engage lawyers.\nCounsel for the applicant relied on the judgment of the Supreme Court in Subhash Kumar v. State of Bihar, which said that the right to life under Article 21 included the right to free water and pollution free air for the full enjoyment of life.\n“In other words, Article 21 of the Constitution of India includes the right to a healthy environment. The Supreme Court has held that Article 21 includes “the enjoyment of pollutant free water and air for full enjoyment of life.”\nIt was argued that a poor tribal person seeking to raise environmental issues may find it difficult to travel such long distances and engage an advocate to fight for their cause.\nFurther relying on the case of Swiss Ribbons v.

State of Maharashtra].\n- Appellant challenged an order of externment passed under Maharashtra Police Act, which had been upheld by the Bombay High Court;\n- The externment order was based on three stale offences, two offences against individuals and the two confidential witness testimonies;\n- The Supreme Court said that an externment order infringes the fundamental right under Article 19(1)(d) to move freely throughout the territory of India and must, therefore, stand the test of reasonableness;\n - Competent authority must be able in a position to show application of mind, the Bench stressed. \n- The order in the present case was found to be passed casually and thus, quashed.\nA Bench of Justices Ajay Rastogi and Abhay S Oka observed that Section 56 of the Maharashtra Police Act although did not require the authority to write a judgment with elaborate reasons, the authority must be able to demonstrate application of mind.\n“..the Court can always consider whether there existed any material on the basis of which a subjective satisfaction could have been recorded. The Court can interfere when either there is no material or the relevant material has not been considered.”\nThe Appellant was externed from a district for two years based on five offences committed under the Indian Penal Code, and the statements of two witnesses who stated that appellant’s activities were dangerous.\nA challenge to the order was dismissed by the Appellate Authority and the Bombay High Court and the appeal reached the Supreme Court.\nIt was the appellant’s submission that the order was mala fide since it was passed at the instance of his maternal uncle, a local Member of Legislative Assembly to resolve family disputes.\nThe Court, while examining the case, noted that the restriction imposed by way of an externment order must stand the test of reasonableness since it made serious inroads into a citizen’s fundamental right to move freely throughout the territory of India under Article 19(1)(d) of the Constitution of India. \nA judgment in the case of Pandharinath Shridhar Rangnekar v. Dy. Commr. of Police, State of Maharashtra was discussed, wherein the top court held that the reasons which necessitate or justify the passing of an extraordinary order of externment arise out of extraordinary circumstances.\nWhile considering this decision, the Bench took note of the practical reality of an externment order, which prevented the person from even staying in his own house, with his family and may deprive him of livelihood.\n“It thus follows that recourse should be taken to Section 56 very sparingly keeping in mind that it is an extraordinary measure,” the Court said.\nExamining the facts of the case, the Bench found that the order was passed in a casual and cavalier manner.\nSince the police was unable to satisfy the magistrate of the necessity to extend the appellant’s detention, they initiated an action of externment, without even considering the judicial magistrate's refusal to extend detention.\nConsequently, the Bench while noting that it was the duty of the Constitutional Court to test the order on well-settled law, allowed the appeal and quashed the High Court’s judgment."}

However, the same has to be done by the government from its own resources in compliance with the prevailing laws.\n“Any such scheme framed by the GNCTD should comply with all the requirements of the (National Food Security Act) NFSA and the Orders issued under the (Essential Commodities Act) ECA. The impugned scheme as presently framed by the Cabinet Decision No. 2987 on 24.03.2021, does not comply with the provisions of the NFSA and TPDS Order, 2015,” the judgment said.\nThe Court further said that the Council of Ministers headed by the Chief Minister is bound to communicate its decisions/ resolutions, including any such scheme or proposal to the Lieutenant Governor, to enable him to examine it and take a call whether or not he has a difference of opinion with any such scheme.\nWhen a decision of the government is placed before the LG for his approval, he shall be mindful of the Supreme Court judgment in State of NCT of Delhi and shall take his decision to express his difference of opinion in the light of this judgment, the Court added.\n“In case the Lieutenant Governor expresses his disagreement with his Council of Ministers headed by the Chief Minister, he may either require the Chief Minister to refer the matter to the President for his decision, or he may, on his own, refer the matter to the President for his decision. Even when the Lieutenant Governor requires the Chief Minister to refer the matter for his decision to the President, it is reference by the Lieutenant Governor and would, therefore, meet the requirement of the proviso to Article 239AA(4) of the Constitution.”\nThe final decision, the High Court said, will rest with the President and both the LG as well as the council of ministers will be bound by that decision and act in accordance with it.\nMMGGRY was the flagship scheme of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) led Delhi Government.\nThe scheme was challenged by the Delhi Sarkari Ration Dealers Sangh and Delhi Ration Dealers Union before the High Court arguing that it was in violation of the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi Act, Targeted PDS System Rules and the Constitution. \nThe dealers in their petition prayed for the doorstep delivery scheme to be struck down.\n\"Direct the Food Corporation of India to strictly ensure that the foodgrains supplied by it under the PDS to the Govt. of NCT of Delhi are as per the standards fixed under the Food, Safety and Standards Act, 2006,\" the plea stated.\nThe Central government had also supported the petitioners' argument that fair price shops are integral to the Food Security Act, and that the handheld payment machines form an integral part of these shops.\nThese machines, called Electronic Point-of-Sale (ePOS) devices, are synced with the Aadhaar database to ensure that the beneficiaries of schemes are the ones who receive its benefits.\nThe scheme was defended by the Delhi government stating that the doorstep delivery scheme would prevent leakages in the system.\nThe State government had further questioned the Centre that if the State is willing to deliver ration at zero cost and ninety per cent of the populace wants it, why should the Centre have any issue with it.\n\"Huge leakage, diversion to black marketeers are the bugs here. To stop that we are having home delivery. Those who want to get from the shops still have that option,\" it was argued."}

The implementation of the programme is directly in the hands of the Government, including the Medical Officers.

The couple already had two children and, therefore, in 2014, she underwent the sterilization surgery at the Tuticorin government hospital. \nHowever, she conceived again in 2015. The doctors at the hospital advised her to abort the \"unwanted\" foetus but the couple decided against it. \nThe woman approached Court saying she did not have enough money to raise a third child. She said that since the tubectomy was unsuccessful, the respondent hospital and the concerned doctor were vicariously and jointly liable for the lapses. \nThe State government argued that the woman had probably failed to follow the doctors' advice and the prescriptions following the surgery. \nBesides, the State argued that \"there was no element of tort involved nor had the petitioner suffered any loss, which could be compensated.\"\nThe Court however, said it was not inclined to accede to the submission made by the State. \nIt said that things had gone \"sideways due to improper performance of the doctor in conducting the sterilization operation on the petitioner.\" \nIt further said that considering the economic and social background of the petitioner and other circumstances, the Court was of the view that the woman must be paid compensation and also financial aid to help raise the third child. \n\"The petitioner is entitled for a compensation of ₹3,00,000. The respondents shall provide free education to the third child of the petitioner, either in a Government School or in a Private School. The fees already paid, if any, shall be refunded and all the expenses on books, stationary, uniforms and other miscellaneous educational expenses shall also be met by the respondents.

The reformation of the convict was still possible in this case, the Court opined.\n“It is not a case where reformation of the appellant is not possible and accordingly, this Court is of the considered view that sentence of imprisonment of life with no remission till 20 years would be the appropriate sentence.

It was stated that Nagpal kidnapped the child on March 18, 2009, and sent messages to the child’s father demanding ransom.\nThe Court was told that he eventually murdered the child using the jack handle of his car and by smothering. The body of the deceased child was then thrown in a dry drain. Nagpal was barely 21 years of age at the time of the murder.\nAfter considering the case, the Court rejected Nagpal’s appeal against his conviction.\nWhile deciding on the reference, the Court said that the evidence on record would suggest that the murder was not pre-planned as Nagpal was not armed with any weapon.\n“Though causing death of someone in itself is perversity, however causing death by smothering and inflicting injuries by jack handle though opined to be consistent with intense torture, cannot be held to be a diabolic or seriously perverse manner of committing murder so as to shock the collective conscience of the society and fall in the category of rarest of rare cases,\" the judgment stated.\nThe Court, therefore, modified the sentence imposed on Nagpal for the offence of murder.

No prudent woman would think of making allegation of impotency in the presence of others, rather she would take necessary steps to see that the reputation of the husband is not affected and not thrown out in public. The complaining of incapacity of the husband to bear children, without any proof creates an intense mental agony and anguish of the husband,\" the Court said in its judgment\nThe Court further noted that the wife made public assertions of her husband's supposed impotence in spite of being unable to prove the same.\n\"Having not proved the allegation, the unproved/unsubstantiated false allegations about impotency has led to mental disturbance of the husband causing disharmony between the husband and wife, which makes the husband unable to stay with the wife,\" the bench said.\nThe bench was seized of an appeal filed by a man challenging orders of a Family Court in Dharwad, which dismissed his divorce petition.\nAccording to the appellant, after he got married in May 2015, his wife behaved normally for a month but later her conduct changed altogether. \nHe claimed that she would call him incompetent to discharge his marital obligations and would also call him impotent, even in front of their relatives.\nThe wife, on the other hand, claimed that her husband would often stay away from her leading to her suspicion that he must be impotent. \nShe claimed that she wanted to live with the husband but the husband would find some reason or the other to stay away from her.\nThe Court noted that the wife couldn't place on record any material to substantiate her allegations against the husband about impotency and incapacity to discharge matrimonial obligations.\nThe actions of the wife would amount to cruelty within the meaning of Section 13(1) (ia) of the Hindu Marriage Act , the Court held.\nViewed in this light, the Court opined that the trial court was not justified in holding that the cruelty asserted by the husband was not proved. \nTherefore, it set aside the the judgment and decree of the Family Court and allowed the petition filed by the husband under Section 13(1)(ia) of the Hindu Marriage Act, granting a decree of divorce in favour of the husband.\nConsidering the fact that the husband earned ₹38,000 per month, the Court ordered him to pay ₹8,000 per month towards the maintenance of the wife, till she remarries.\nAdvocates Srinand A Pachhapure represented the appellant husband while advocate SR Hegde represented the wife.\nRecently, the Bombay High Court had reduced the sentence of a man from life imprisonment to 12 years in jail after noting that the wife had shouted on a busy road that the convict (her husband) was impotent, and it was natural for a man to feel ashamed upon being so labelled."}

{"ID": "id_486", "Summary": "Restaurants and eateries are not entitled to serve hookah including herbal hookah and doing so would amount to nuisance since a restaurant is a place where children, women and elderly also visit, the Bombay High Court recently said [Sayli B Parkhi vs State of Maharashtra].\nHence, a division bench of Justice Girish Kulkarni and RN Laddha denied permission to a restaurant in the eastern suburbs of Mumbai that sought to serve herbal hookah.\nThe Court said that it may not be possible even for the eating house to control the ingredients of the hookah once the apparatus is in the custody of the customers. \n\"Illustratively, in a restaurant or eating house, where children, women and elderly visit for refreshments/eating, it cannot be expected that hookah is one of the menus being served and more particularly of the category as offered by the petitioner using flame or burnt charcoal. This would amount to an absolute nuisance in so far as an eating house is concerned,\" the bench said. \nFurther, it said that the impact of such material on the customers at the eating house can just not be imagined.\n\"If it is permitted, every eating house in the city can provide 'hookah,' the nature of which the Municipal Commissioner in the normal course of his duties cannot ascertain.

The civic body found it seriously objectionable as it was endangering the public safety and putting life at risk and breaching General License Condition.\nThe Court said that it cannot be conceived that an activity which is not specifically permitted under the terms and conditions of license would be deemed to be included in any license conditions. Such reading of the license conditions would lead to an absurdity, the bench opined. \nThe bench was of the view that the Municipal Commissioner cannot be expected to keep a continuous vigil on the hookah trade/activities of the petitioner including on the petitioner’s claim of its herbal ingredients and to a further claim that such hookah does not affect the “health” and/or create nuisance.\n\"Once it is clear that hookah activities are not part of the Eating House license conditions, such activity cannot be permitted.

Shahnawaz, etc].\nJustice Subramonium Prasad allowed bail to Shanawaz and Mohd Ayyub while dismissing the pleas of Sadiq and Irshad Ali.\nFor Shahnawz, it was opined that in the present case when there was a crowd involved, at the juncture of grant or denial of bail, the Court must hesitate before arriving at the conclusion that every member of the unlawful assembly inhabits a common intention to accomplish the unlawful common object.\n“There cannot be an umbrella assumption of guilt on behalf of every accused by the Court, and every decision must be taken based on a careful consideration of the facts and circumstances in the matter therein. This principle, therefore, gains utmost importance when the Court considers the question of grant or denial of bail,” it stated.\nWhile dealing with Ayyub’s bail plea the Court noted merely being one of the organisers of the protest and communicating with others who participated in the protest was not sufficient to justify the contention that he was involved in the pre-planning of the alleged incident.\n“This Court has already opined that the right to protest and express dissent is a right which occupies a fundamental stature in a democratic polity, and therefore, the fact that the Petitioner was part of the protest is not a sufficient ground to refuse bail to him,” it was held.\nOne of two who were refused bail, Sadiq, was stated to have been spotted on multiple CCTV footage, carrying a danda/stick with co-accused Imran Ansari.\nCalling it the “clinching” piece of evidence that tilted the Court to prolong the incarceration of the petitioner was his presence in the “Vishal Chaudhary” video where he was clearly identified at the scene of crime, holding a stick in one hand and pelting stones with the other at the officials in uniform who were present around him, and were “heavily and hopelessly” outnumbered.\n“This Court is of the opinion that the Vishal Chaudhary video reveals that the Petitioner is not merely a curious onlooker. The fact that he actively participated and pelted stones at the Police Officials at the scene of crime justifies the invocation of Section 149 IPC read with Section 302 IPC in the instant case,” the Court observed.\nThe order added, “This Court is of the opinion that the footage of the Petitioner at the Scene of Crime is quite egregious, and is therefore sufficient to keep the Petitioner in custody.”\nAt the time of deciding Irshad’s bail plea, the Court referred to the his identification in the multiple CCTV footage, carrying a danda/stick and provoking a crowd.\n“This Court has perused the video in slow motion and is of the opinion that the petitioner is visible and his presence at the scene of crime cannot be disputed. Furthermore, the petitioner does not satisfy the ingredients to claim bail on ground of parity,” it was stated.\nOn September 3, the Court had granted bail to five accused persons while holding that the right to protest and express dissent is a right that occupies a fundamental stature in a democratic polity.\nTherefore, the sole act of protesting should not be employed as a weapon to justify the incarceration of those who are exercising this right, the order stated.\n“It is the Constitutional duty of the Court to ensure that there is no arbitrary deprivation of personal liberty in the face of excess of State power,” Justice Prasad had said.\nThe Court also noted that Section 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object) specifically read with Section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) could not be applied on the basis of “vague evidence and general allegations.”\n“When there is a crowd involved, at the juncture of grant or denial of bail, the Court must hesitate before arriving at the conclusion that every member of the unlawful assembly inhabits a common intention to accomplish the unlawful common object,” the order observed.\nIt also stated that there couldn’t be an umbrella assumption of guilt on behalf of every accused by the Court, and every decision must be taken on careful consideration of the facts and circumstances.\n“This principle, therefore, gains utmost importance when the Court considers the question of grant or denial of bail,” it added.\nThe Court also delved into the individual cases of the five accused in the case, which pertained to the alleged murder of head constable Rattan Lal during the violence.\nSenior Advocate Salman Khurshid, Advocates Bilal Anwar Khan, Anshu Kapoor, Aman Khullar, Aadya Mishra and Sommya Chaturvedi represented Ayyub. \nAdvocate Dinesh Tiwari appeared for Shahnawaz and Sadiq whereas \nAdvocates Salim Malik, Nasir Ali, Abdul Kadir and Shavana represented Irshad.\nFor State - Additional Solicitor General SV Raju, Special Public Prosecutor Amit Prasad and Advocates Anshuman Raghuvanshi and Ayodhya Prasad."}

Additionally, while public interest immunity claims conceivably impact the principles of natural justice, sealed cover proceedings infringe the principles natural justice and open justice.\"\nThe Court took exception to the 'cavalier manner' in which claims of national security argument was raised by the Central government. \n\"It is our constitutional duty to mention the cavalier manner in which Union of India has raised the claim of national security. Other than merely claiming that national security is involved, both in the affidavit that was filed before the High Court and in the submissions before us, the Union of India made no attempt to explain how non-disclosure would be in the interest of national security.\"\nThe Court also shed light on when sealed cover proceedings should not be adopted.\n\"It is sufficient to state that if the purpose could be realised effectively by public interest immunity proceedings or any other less restrictive means, then the sealed cover procedure should not be adopted. The court should undertake an analysis of the possible procedural modalities that could be used to realise the purpose, and the means that are less restrictive of the procedural guarantees must be adopted.\"\nThe Central government had disclosed its reasons behind the ban to the Kerala High Court in a sealed cover.

{"ID": "id_493", "Summary": "The Meghalaya High Court recently upheld the dismissal of a police officer with terror links even though authorities did not disclose reasons for not holding an inquiry [Sanjeeb Ch Marak v. State of Meghalaya & ors].\nA Bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice W Diengdoh held in its order,\n\"When a member of the police force was found betraying his own force and supplying information to an extremist outfit that the police organisation was trying to deal with, it was justifiable on the part of the disciplinary authority to consider it to be not reasonably practicable to afford the writ petitioner an opportunity of dealing with the charge against him in the course of any inquiry. Some latitude has to be given to the police authorities especially in a scenario where no case of malice in fact is made out.\"\nThe High Court was hearing an appeal in a case where a police officer was dismissed from service based on a confidential report, without an inquiry being conducted as is required under Article 311 of the Constitution. The dismissal was upheld by the appellate authority and a single-judge of the High Court. \nArticle 311(2) of the Constitution acts as a safety-net for government servants, by mandating that any dismissal from service or reduction of rank can only be done after an inquiry in which the accused has been informed of the charges levelled against them and given a reasonable opportunity of being heard. The proviso to this Article states that an inquiry can be dispensed with:\na) if the conduct of the officer has led to his conviction on a criminal charge;\nb) if the authority is satisfied that for some reason, to be recorded by that authority in writing, it is not reasonably practicable to hold such inquiry;\nc) where the President or the Governor is satisfied that in the interest of the security of the State, it is not expedient to hold such inquiry.\nBefore the High Court, counsel for the appellant police officer argued that dismissal from service can only take place on conviction by a criminal court, and that any reasons for not holding an inquiry towards the same should be recorded by the relevant authority in writing. This mandatory inquiry cannot be dispensed with and thus the dismissal orders have no legs to stand on, it was submitted. It was further argued that dismissal on security grounds can only be on the satisfaction of the President or Governor, which was absent in this case.\nThe Court noted that the appellant had passed on information pertaining to police operations and movements to a banned and extremist outfit by the name of Garo National Liberation Army. Further, at the time of the confidential report, there was a spurt in violence and activities undertaken by the Garo National Liberation Army, in which several police personnel lost their lives.\nEven though it conceded that the dismissal order did not explicitly give reasons for not giving the accused a chance to defend himself in an inquiry, the Court noted,\n\"Judicial notice must be taken of the fact that the police obtain confidential information from undisclosed sources and it may neither be prudent nor practicable to expose the identity of the sources or risk such sources to be cross-examined or their identities revealed. In such a scenario, particularly with senior police officials having no axe to grind against the appellant having found that the material against the appellant was clinching, the reason for dispensing with the inquiry is self-evident and writ large in the departmental orders impugned without being expressly recorded.\"\nThe Bench concluded with a word of caution. While acknowledging that when the law requires a certain thing to be done in a particular manner, it has to be done in such manner or not at all, the Court held that no adjudication is made without reference to the context and the surrounding circumstances.\n\"It is also possible that the reason for dispensing with the inquiry is self-evident in the order impugned despite it not being expressly spelt out,\" it stated.\nIn this light, it was held that the mandate of Article 311(2) \"may be seen to have been complied with.\"\nAdvocate KC Gautam appeared for the appellant.

In this backdrop, the counsel for the petitioner vehemently contended that neither he was convicted in any case till date nor he is having any criminal history except the aforesaid case.\nHe also submitted that it is a settled law by the Supreme Court that the passport cannot be denied merely on the basis of criminal case. In support of this, he placed reliance upon judgment passed by the apex court in the case of Vangala Kasturi Rangacharyulu vs. Central Bureau of Investigation, wherein the Court had held that the passport authority cannot refuse the renewal of the passport on the ground of pendency of the criminal appeal.\nThe High Court, accordingly, directed the passport authority to consider the application of the petitioner for issuance of passport within six weeks.\n\"In the facts and circumstances of the case, we are of the considered opinion that the claim of the petitioner must be processed in the light of the observation made by the Apex Court in the above noted judgement as well as in the light of the judgment in Basoo Yadav within six weeks from the date of production of a certified copy of this order,\" the Court ordered.\nAdvocates Shashi Kant Shukla and Sadhana Dubey appeared on behalf of the petitioner.

The girl eventually became pregnant. \nThe trial court sentenced the accused to rigorous imprisonment for life.\nThe accused argued against the conviction citing omissions and discrepancies in the victim’s statement, delay in lodging the FIR, absence of DNA testing and injuries.\nWhile examining the submissions of the defense, the Court began by discussing a judgment of the Supreme Court in State of Punjab v. Gurmit Singh where it was laid down that in a case relating to sexual assault and rape, the evidence of the victim girl was vital and if found reliable, could form the basis of conviction without further corroboration.\n“Seeking corroboration of her statement before relying upon the same, as a rule, in such cases amounts to adding insult to injury. Why should the evidence of a girl or a woman who complains of rape or sexual molestation, be viewed with doubt, disbelief or suspicion?\" the Court asked.\nThe then proceeded to examine the contention that there were contradictions in the victim's statement.\nThe Court after examining the material on record opined that it found nothing to disbelieve the victim.\nThe Court also opined that the absence of DNA test could be a drawback on the investigating officer’s part but not the victim's, since she had no control over the investigating agency.\nWith these observations, the conviction of the trial court was upheld.\nAlthough the Court acknowledged that rape and sexual assault lead to both physical and mental scars which the victims have to bear throughout their lives, it opined that the sentence handed down to the accused need to be relooked.\nConsidering the facts of the case, the sentence was reduced to rigorous imprisonment for 14 years.

State of Maharashtra].\nThe judgment was delivered by a Bench of Justices DY Chandrachud and Indira Banerjee. Pronouncing the verdict today, Justice Chandrachud said that prima facie, it could not be held that Goswami had abetted the suicide of Anvay Naik.\n\"Prima facie, on the application of the test which has been laid down by this Court in a consistent line of authority which has been noted above, it cannot be said that the appellant was guilty of having abetted the suicide within the meaning of Section 306 of the IPC...\"\nThe Bench lamented that the High Court had failed to establish whether or not there was a prima facie case under Section 306 of the Indian Penal Code (abetment to suicide) against the journalist. The judgment reads,\n\"The striking aspect of the impugned judgment of the High Court spanning over fifty-six pages is the absence of any evaluation even prima facie of the most basic issue. The High Court, in other words, failed to apply its mind to a fundamental issue which needed to be considered while dealing with a petition for quashing under Article 226 of the Constitution or Section 482 of the CrPC.\"\nAfter highlighting the factors that High Courts need to consider while deciding to exercise jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution for grant of bail, the Court noted,\n\"The appellants are residents of India and do not pose a flight risk during the investigation or the trial. There is no apprehension of tampering of evidence or witnesses. Taking these factors into consideration, the order dated 11 November 2020 envisaged the release of the appellants on bail.\"\nIt was further noted that the High Court had failed to consider that Goswami was made a target on previous occasions.\n\"…the misuse of the criminal law is a matter of which the High Court and the lower Courts in this country must be alive. In the present case, the High Court could not but have been cognizant of the specific ground which was raised before it by the appellant that he was being made a target as a part of a series of occurrences which have been taking place since April 2020.\"\nCalling upon courts at all levels to safeguard the liberties of citizens, the judgment authored by Justice Chandrachud further reads,\n\"Courts must be alive to the need to safeguard the public interest in ensuring that the due enforcement of criminal law is not obstructed. The fair investigation of crime is an aid to it. Equally it is the duty of courts across the spectrum – the district judiciary, the High Courts and the Supreme Court – to ensure that the criminal law does not become a weapon for the selective harassment of citizens.\"\nPertinently, the Court also noted,\n\"Doors of courts cannot be closed in such cases and courts should remain open for all cases of deprivation of personal liberty and such deprivation cannot be even for one day.\"\nWhile disposing of the appeal, the Court concluded,\n\"We have given expression to our anguish in a case where a citizen has approached this court. We have done so in order to reiterate principles which must govern countless other faces whose voices should not go unheard.\"\nThe interim order will remain in operation pending the disposal of the proceedings before the High Court, and for a period of four weeks from the date of the judgment of the High Court.\nOn November 11, the Vacation Bench of the Court had granted interim bail to Goswami, who was in judicial custody for his alleged involvement in a 2018 abetment to suicide case.\nWhile doing so, the Bench had held that the Bombay High Court was incorrect in denying Goswami interim bail on November 7. It thus directed for Goswami and the two other co-accused to be released immediately on a bond of Rs 50,000.\nDuring the course of the last hearing, Justice Chandrachud had observed,\n\"If we don't interfere in this case today, we will walk on a path of destruction. If left to me, I won't watch the channel and you may differ in ideology, but constitutional courts will have to protect such freedoms...\"\nAppearing for Goswami, Senior Advocate Harish Salve had highlighted the malice on the part of the State in prosecuting his client. He took the Court through the contents of the FIR, pointing out that an \"A Summary\" report denoting closure of the case was filed last year.\nThe Supreme Court had expressed three concerns, namely, the High Court said that the complainant was not heard when A Summary report was filed; the High Court held that acceptance of A Summary does not prevent probe under Section 173(a) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC); and that the prayer to quash the 2018 FIR was still alive before the High Court.\nPointing out that the Chief Judicial Magistrate at Alibaug had stated that the arrest of Goswami was illegal, and that a prima facie link between Goswami and Naik's suicide cannot be created, Salve pressed for his client's release. He asked the Court,\n\"Will heavens fall if the man is released?\"\nSenior Advocate Kapil Sibal had urged the Court to not set a \"dangerous precedent\" by granting bail on a reading of the FIR, when the matter was before the High Court. He said,\n\"Wait for day after tomorrow and don't lay down this precedent. We know what is going on in your mind but we know when extraordinary orders are passed in extraordinary cases then it has repercussions.\"\nShortly after the matter was listed before the Apex Court, Senior Advocate and President of the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA), Dushyant Dave questioned the manner in which the bail plea was listed the very next day after it was filed.\nDave has lodged \"strong protest\" with the Secretary General of the Supreme Court Registry, pointing out that Goswami's petitions before the Court are listed urgently while other similarly placed litigants are kept waiting.\nGoswami was in judicial custody since November 4 following his arrest in relation to the 2018 suicide of interior designer Anvay Naik and his mother. Naik had named Goswami and two others in his suicide note, alleging that they had failed to pay up money owed for the work done by his company.\nThe case was initially closed in 2019, before it was re-opened in 2020 based on a representation made by Naik's daughter, Adnya Naik to State Home Minister, Anil Deshmukh."}

In July 1994, through a Panchayat held in the village, the couple got mutually divorced after the husband paid permanent alimony of ₹22,000 to the wife.\nSubsequently, after the wife re-married, the husband sought a decree of divorce on the basis of mental cruelty and long desertion. However, she did not appear in court despite sufficient service through publication.\nThe family court proceeded with the case ex-parte and dismissed the husband's plea, noting that there were no grounds of cruelty to grant divorce.\nAfter going through the facts, the High Court remarked that the family court adopted a hyper-technical approach while dismissing the husband's case.

The person or authority is discharging public duty/public functions. \n2. There action under challenge falls in domain of public law and not under common law.\" \nThus, the Court ruled that a petition under Article 226 would be maintainable only after determining the nature of the duty to be enforced by the body or authority rather than identifying the authority against whom it is sought.\n\"The substance of the discussion made above is that a writ petition would be maintainable against the authority or the person which may be a private body, if it discharges public function/public duty, which is otherwise primary function of the State referred in the judgment of the Apex Court in the case of Ramakrishnan Mission (supra) and the issue under public law is involved,\" the judgment said.\nThe Court was hearing a reference made by a single-judge who had formulated the following two questions for determination by a larger bench:\n“(i) Whether the element of public function and public duty inherent in the enterprise that an educational institution undertakes, conditions of service of teachers, whose functions are a sine qua non to the discharge of that public function or duty, can be regarded as governed by the private law of contract and with no remedy available under Article 226 of the Constitution? \n(ii) Whether the decision in Rajesh Kumar Srivastava and others versus State of UP and others is in teeth of the holding of the Full Bench in Roychan Abraham versus State of UP and others [(2019) SCC OnLine All 3935]?”\nWhile answering the former question, the Court said that the remedy under Article 226 of the Constitution of India would be available against an authority or a person only when twin test is satisfied. \nIt held that it is not enough that the authority or the person is discharging public function or public duty but the action challenged should also fall in the domain of public law. \n\"The writ petition would not be maintainable against an authority or person even if it is discharging public function/public duty, if the controversy pertains to the private law such as a dispute arising out of contract or under the common law,\" the Court held\nOn the second question, it said that the judgment of Allahabad High Court in case of Rajesh Kumar Srivastava and others v.

International Commission on Irrigation and Drainage, the Court held.\nThe court said that there is a thin line between “public functions” and “private functions” discharged by a person or a private body/authority. \n\"Even if a person or authority is discharging public function or public duty, the writ petition would be maintainable under Article 226 of the Constitution, if Court is satisfied that action under challenge falls in the domain of public law, as distinguished from private law,\" the Court said.\nAfter placing reliance on various judgments of the Supreme Court and High Court, the Court came to conclusion that a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution would be maintainable against:\n(i) the Government; (ii) an authority; (iii) a statutory body; (iv) an instrumentality or agency of the State; (v) a company which is financed and owned by the State; (vi) a private body run substantially on State funding; (vii) a private body discharging public duty or positive obligation of public nature; (viii) a person or a body under liability to discharge any function under any statute, to compel it to perform such a statutory function."}
{"ID": "id_514", "Summary": "The Madhya Pradesh High Court recently ordered the police to investigate an Arya Samaj trust in Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh for illegally converting a Muslim woman to Hinduism and then solemnising her marriage to a man without any legal sanction [Rahul v State of MP].\nA Division Bench of Justices Rohit Arya and Milind Ramesh Phadke noted that such religious conversion by the Arya Samaj Vivah Trust is considered to be illegal.\n\"The abortive act of conversion by such self-styled Vivah Mandirs involves people from Hindu and Muslim community and may cause serious law and order problem, therefore, this Court may invoke suo motu jurisdiction and issue notice to the said Vivah Mandir,\" the order states.\nIt further noted that the nefarious activities of the trust in converting people from one religion to another without any authority of law was detrimental to the social fabric and public order, and could also trigger mass unrest which may result into communal tension and riotous activities.\nCalling for a police probe into the activities of the trust, the Bench ordered,\n\"Conversion of a Muslim girl to Hindu religion, found to be illegal and vulnerable in public domain, Senior Superintendent of Police, Ghaziabad is directed to get an investigation done for verification of existence/constitution and members of the respondent no.6/Vivah Mandir Trust...if any, of the alleged activities and thereafter suitable corrective measures be taken as per law and, if need be, also forward the enquiry report to the competent Authority under the relevant Trust Act to initiate action against the so called Trust.\"\nIt also directed the police to look into the activities/methodology of functioning and the books of accounts and records of the trust.\nThe Bench also observed that the said activities of Vivah Trust tantamount to running marriage shops on commercial lines. The same is a serious threat to the sanctity attached to marriages recognized under personal laws, particularly the Hindu Marriage Act, the judges opined.\nThe Court was hearing a habeas corpus plea filed by one Rahul in 2021 praying for the release of his wife, Hina, who was illegally confined by police authorities in a nari sudhar grah (women's shelter home) in Gwalior.\nThe petitioner claimed that they married each other after running away from their homes, and for this purpose, his wife (a Muslim) converted to Hinduism. He submitted a conversion certificate and marriage certificate issued on September 17, 2019 by the Arya Samaj Vivah Mandir at Ghaziabad.\nHowever, during the hearings, the Bench stressed upon the need to decide the validity of such marriages in eyes of law. It thus noted that the conversion certificate and the marriage certificate were without any authority of law and hence null and void.\n\"Considering these factors and the sensitivity of the issue involved, this Court is constrained to exercise its extraordinary constitutional jurisdiction, under Article 226 of the Constitution, to checkmate such situation and its recurrence in future at the hands of respondent no.6 (Trust),\" the Court said.\nThe Court also found that the issuance of a conversion certificate by the trust was in stark violation of Section 5 of the Madhya Pradesh Dharma Swatantrya Adhiniyam, 1968. It was noted that the trust was empowered only to arrange marriage ceremonies according to Hindu rites and customs, and not to solemnize them and issue marriage certificates.\nWith regard to the woman’s release, the Court observed that since she was a major, she had the right to choose. \n\"The Additional District Magistrate is directed to arrange for an in-camera video-graphed meeting of the corpus with her parents within one week from today and, thereafter, despite meeting if corpus, who is major, still is not inclined to go with her parents, she shall be set free forthwith to go as per her wishes,\" the Court ordered.\nThe petitioner was represented by Advocate Suresh Agrawal, while Additional Advocate General MPS Raghuvanshi and Deputy Advocate General Rajesh Shukla appeared for the State. Advocates Balwant Singh Billowria and Prabhat Kumar Singh appeared for the trust, while Advocate Faisal Ali Shah assisted the Court as amicus curiae."}

Such poor relatives, who were never staying with the husband, cannot be asked to face the proceedings on some stray statements about the domestic violence. Therefore, the application deserves to be allowed,\" Justice Kankanwadi said in the order passed on July 4.\nThe Court was hearing a plea filed by Patil seeking to quash and set aside the criminal proceedings initiated against her by her sister-in-law. \nThe complainant-wife had alleged that her in-laws and Patil had been torturing her and subjecting her to domestic violence.\nHowever, the Court noted that the complainant in her complaint itself, had stated that her in-laws lived in Pune and Patil lived in Bhusawal, where she was serving as a veterinarian.\n\"When she herself had given the address of the in-laws of Pune and then gives address of the applicant of Bhusawal, then, it was incumbent upon the aggrieved person (complainant) to satisfy as to what point of time the applicant and she herself were staying in the shared household after the marriage.

{"ID": "id_519", "Summary": "The Supreme Court on Tuesday called for the substitution of paddy with alternative crops in Punjab to prevent stubble burning in the region and in view of concerns that paddy cultivation affects the water table of the State.\nThe bench of Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Justice Sudhanshu Dhulia said that the switch from paddy to alternative crops was necessary to prevent stubble burning next year. \nThe Court added that the switchover can occur only when the Minimum Support Price (MSP) for farmers is not granted for paddy but for the cultivation of alternative crops.\nThe Court noted that the “very sowing of paddy which is not a local crop” and which is “not consumed locally” was the basis of the recurring problem.\n“The switch over can only occur when the MSP is not granted for paddy but is given to an alternative crop, something which the Central Government in any case is seeking to encourage by growing and utilization of the traditional crops,\" the order stated. \nThe Court was hearing an application in a matter concerning various environmental issues.\nThe observations from the top court came in the backdrop of the suggestions made by Punjab Advocate General Gurminder Singh who submitted that the growth of paddy was causing the water table to decline drastically in the state.\nSingh suggested that paddy cultivation must be phased out and substituted with other crops. \nIn this context, he said the Central government should explore the option of giving minimum support prices for alternative crops to incentivise their cultivation instead of paddy. \nThe Court's attention was also drawn to the Punjab Preservation of Subsoil Water Act, 2009, and how compliance with the Act was leading to air pollution. \nThe objective of that Act was to preserve the subsoil water and the Act provided for punitive measures so that the farmers sow the crop after a specified date.\nBefore the Act came into force, paddy used to be sowed a little early in the year and, hence, the problem of stubble burning was not acute because of wind and weather conditions that dissipated the particulate matter from stubble burning. \nHowever, now, due to the Act, the cutting of the paddy gets delayed and it takes place during a season where, due to atmospheric conditions, the impact is borne by Delhi and surrounding areas, the Court noted. \nThe Punjab Advocate General further highlighted the misuse of the MSP scheme, explaining that paddy grown in adjacent States was being brought into Punjab to claim the MSP under the State government's policy.\nOn stubble burning, Singh suggested that Punjab and Delhi should bear the 50 percent cost for the use of machines to manage the stubble and that the rest should be provided by the Central government. \nAgreeing with the submission, the Court said when the Centre provides so many other subsidies, there is no reason why this cost should also not be borne by it.\n“Let us say that these are immediate measures required for the short term,” it added.\nThe Court said that it wants all stakeholders to act promptly in respect of these aspects.\nIn its interim order, the top court has also ordered that the local Station House Officers in Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and some parts of Delhi be made responsible for stopping stubble burning incidents, with oversight from the Chief Secretary and Director General of Police of the concerned State."}
{"ID": "id_52", "Summary": "The Allahabad High Court recently observed that the police administration still continues to be comfortable \"with colonial structure\" despite the government marking India's 75th Independence Day celebrations as Azadi-ka-Amrit Mahotsav with a vision for citizens' welfare [Chantara v. State].\nJustice Manju Ravi Chauhan made the observation while criticising the cavalier manner in which the police had prepared a counter affidavit in response to an anticipatory bail plea.\n\"Since 75th Independence Day Celebrations, government has marked Azadi-ka-Amrit Mahotsav terming it to be 'Amrit Kaal' with prospective vision in welfare of citizens of the country, however, Police Administration feels more comfortable to remain with colonial structure. Such attitude of functionaries who are instrumental to safeguard the public at large diminishes the ingrained belief over the System and plays a role in impeding the goal set out to ascend to new heights of prosperity,\" the Court's order stated.\nJustice Chauhan found that the counter affidavit's contents reflected the impetuousness of the government counsel as well as the deponent. Each claim in the bail application was simply negated without due care and as per their whims and without any supporting material, the Court noted.\nIt further said that it was a staggering irony that the Deputy Superintendent of Police, who was the deponent of the counter affidavit, believed that he could make such submissions without any cogent material supporting the claims in the affidavit.\nThe Court went on to note that it had already warned government counsel repeatedly to be careful while dictating counter-affidavits, seemingly to no avail.\n\"Taking note of such negligent pleadings in counter affidavits, in numerous cases, this Court has already warned the learned Government Advocate as well as learned AGAs repeatedly to be careful while dictating counter affidavits but seems to be with no result,\" the order stated.\nThe Court was hearing an anticipatory bail application filed by one Chantara who was booked for offences under the Dowry Prohibition Act and related offences under the Indian Penal Code. \nEarlier in 2020, she had been granted interim protection by the Court. At the time, the State was also directed to file a counter-affidavit.\nThe Court found that the counter-affidavit so filed was drafted in a cavalier manner and was bereft of any cogent or coherent factual and legal foundation.\nThe Court observed that on a bare reading of the counter-affidavit, the claim of the police that the bail applicant had \"criminal intent\" appeared to be based on skewed information. \n\"No such officer is allowed to enjoy impunity on the pretext of discharging official functioning nor can be set free to form an audacious remark without any basis,\" the Court added.\nThe Court added it was the prime duty of the government counsel, who drafts the counter affidavit, to acquire material that supports the statements being made in the counter affidavit.\nThe Court further noted that the government counsel, IPS Rajpoot, AGA-I, who drafted the affidavit did not hesitate in \"proving\" that the bail applicant had a \"criminal mind\" without adducing any substance to support the claim.\n\"Excerpt of the averments in of counter affidavit says \"लेकिन प्रार्थिनी अभियुक्ता आपराधिक प्रवर्ति की महिला हे\" ['the woman is of criminal background']. Though no document is annexed. Remaining reply in entire counter affidavit rests on denial to each fact mentioned in anticipatory bail application,\" the Court observed. \nIt said that it could not turn a blind eye to such imprecise conduct and proceeded to direct that a personal affidavit be filed by the police officer concerned. \nThis affidavit should detail the material based on which the police has made its claims in the counter-affidavit, the Court said. \n\"Let a personal affidavit be filed by the deponent of counter affidavit dated 22.9.2020 (Shailendra Singh Son of Sri Mahipal Singh, Deputy Superintendent of Police/ Circle Officer, Sahawar, District Kasganj), within ten days, as to what was in his possession for making statement in paragraph no. 10 of the counter affidavit.

{"ID": "id_520", "Summary": "The Bombay High Court on Friday asked the Central government to consider the suggestions contained in an Amicus Curiae report with respect to the Notaries (Amendment) Bill, 2021 [Dhanlaxmi Chandu Devrukar v. The Town Planning and connected pleas].\nAn order to that effect was passed by a Bench of Justices SJ Kathawalla and Milind Jadhav after noting that the Department of Legal Affairs had published the Notaries (Amendment) Bill, 2021 (Bill) inviting comments and suggestions on the same by December 15, 2022.\n\"We deem it appropriate that the Registrar General of this Court forthwith forward a copy of this Order along with the report (of Amicus Curiae) dated December 9, 2021 submitted by the Learned Advocate Mr. Nausher Kohli, to the Department of Legal Affairs for their due consideration. We request the Department of Legal Affairs to give due consideration to this Order and the Report dated December 9, 2021 submitted by Mr. Nausher Kohli, Learned Advocate whilst enacting the Draft Bill,\" the Court directed.\nThe order was passed after the Court noted with anguish the unprofessional manner in which advocates appointed as notaries were functioning with such lawyers often notarizing documents from vehicles parked in public parking and taxis.\n\"It has recently been observed that the Notaries have started notarizing documents from vehicles parked in a public parking lot instead of an office/chamber. It has also been observed that Notaries have been operating from public taxis around the vicinity of this Court.....which shows to what extent the legal profession has degraded causing anguish not only to the judiciary but also lowering the dignity of the profession in the eyes of general public,” the order stated.\nThe Court had sought for suggestions/ recommendations regarding changes required in the Notaries Act and Rules framed so as to avoid any mischief being played by advocate, notary or party in the course of getting document notarised.\nAdvocate Nausher Kohli had been appointed as Amicus Curiae to assist the Court.\nKohli along with advocate Akash Agarwal proposed the following suggestions to the Bill:\nUse of technology: including for an updated list of registered Notaries;\nAmend Form XV which provides for maintaining a notary register;\nImplement practices from foreign jurisdictions: like Remote Online Notarization (RON);\nAuthenticating insertions or alterations subsequent to document being notarized;\nRight to privacy: Protecting the confidential information in the register;\nMandatory issuance of receipt for fees charged by notary;\nFees charged should not exceed the rates mentioned in the Rules;\nNotaries should not operate from their office and certainly not from a public or private vehicle around the vicinity of Court.\nThe Court remarked that after faultily carrying out notarization, the very purpose for which a document is required to be notarised is defeated as the Court is ignorant of the mischief played in relation to a particular document.\n“It is distressing to note that in some cases, even advocates support such illegal practices,” the Bench commented.\nThe Court emphasized that in light of the cases coming to light about the fraudulent document, the Act and Rules required major reform.\n“In our considered opinion, undoubtedly, the Act and Rules framed thereunder are in pressing need for major reform. We are, on a daily basis, coming across matters wherein Notaries, Advocates and Parties are mischievously getting documents notarized,” the Court recorded.\nIt was then pointed out that the Central government was mooting amendments to the law. \nThe Court then proceeded to order that the Amicus report be sent to the Department of Legal Affairs to be considered while amending the Act."}
{"ID": "id_522", "Summary": "The Supreme Court Thursday held that the decision of former Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari's decision to call for a floor test based on the request of 34 MLAs of the Eknath Shinde faction was incorrect since Koshyari did not have enough objective material before him to conclude that the then Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had lost the confidence of the house [Subhash Desai vs Principal Secretary, Governor of Maharashtra and ors]\nHowever, the Court held that the status quo cannot be restored now since Thackeray did not face the floor test but chose to resign.\n\"Status quo ante cannot be restored as Mr. Thackeray did not face the floor test and resigned. and thus governor was correct in calling Eknath Shinde to form the government,\" the Court held.\nHence, the Court said that the Governor's decision to call Eknath Shinde to be sworn in as Chief Minister was correct.\nThe Court, however, underlined that the Governor could not have doubted the majority of the Thackeray government and dissatisfaction of some MLAs was not enough to call the floor test.\n\"Nothing shows members withdrew support and communication showed it disagreed with some policy decision of the Udhhav Thackeray government. Whether there would be deliberation or whether they (Shinde MLAs) will merge with another party was unclear,\" the Court said.\nHence, the Governor was wrong to conclude that Uddhav Thakceray had lost majority in the house, the Court said.\nGovernor must use objective criteria and not use subjective satisfaction, the Court underscored.\n\"Even if it is assumed that MLAs wanted to leave the government, it was only dissatisfaction portrayed. Floor test cannot be used as a medium to solve a intra party difference or inter party differences. There is a difference between a party not supporting government and members of some political party being unhappy,\" the Court said.\nThe Governor is not entitled to enter political arena and play a role in intra party to inter party dispute and he could not have acted on the basis that some members want to leave Shiv Sena. \n\"This cannot mean that they had withdrawn support from the floor of the house,\" the bench said.\nThe Constitution Bench of Chief Justice of India (CJI) DY Chandrachud and Justices MR Shah, Krishna Murari, Hima Kohli and P S Narasimha also referred to a larger bench the issue relating to speaker's powers as laid down in the 2016 judgment in Nabam Rebia case. \nThe Court said that the Nabam Rebia judgment did not decide on whether a speaker against whom a disqualification notice was pending could decide on disqualification petitions against MLAs.\n\"We direct the case to be referred to a larger bench since these issues were not decided in nabam rebia - whether temporary disablement of speaker can be misused by the speakers and whether a constitutional hiatus will be ensued due to temporary disablement of speaker,\" the Court said.\nThe Court framed the following question for decision by a larger bench:\n\"Whether notice of removal of speaker stops him from deciding disqualification of members.\"\nImportantly, the Court held that the legislature party (i.e. majority of the MLAs of a particular political party in the house) is not the competent body to appoint the party whip as that will amount to serving the umbilical chord of the legislature party with the political party. \n\"To hold that legislature party appoints the whip will be like to severe the umbilical chord... this is not the system as evisaged by the constitution. 10th schedule will be rendered otiose.. courts cannot be excluded by article 212 to examine action of speaker in recognising the whip,\" the Court said.\nHence, the Court ruled that the appointment of Bharatshet Gogawale as the party whip in the house by the Shinde faction of Shiv Sena was illegal.\n\"The speaker on taking cognisance of the statement by Mr. Shinde did not undertake to identify who was the whip and he should have undertaken an enquiry. Decision to appoint Mr. Gogawale as chief whip was illegal since whip can be appointed only by the political party,\" the Court ordered.\nThe verdict came in a case that had its genesis in the split of the Shiv Sena political party into two factions, one led by Thackeray and the other by Shinde, who went on to replace Thackeray as Maharashtra's Chief Minister after the split in June 2022.\nRebel MLAs of the Shinde faction received disqualification notices from the then Deputy Speaker for acting against the party whip while voting during the Member of Legislative Council (MLC) elections in the State.\nThe Supreme Court was called to consider whether rebel Members should be disqualified. On June 27, 2022, the Court granted interim relief to Shinde and his rebel group of MLAs by extending the time to file responses to the disqualification notices sent by the Deputy Speaker, till July 12. Subsequently, the Court on June 29 also gave the go-ahead to a floor test called for by Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari.\nThis led to the fall of the Thackeray government, following which Shinde took oath as Chief Minister with the backing of the BJP, the single largest party in the House.\nThe Thackeray camp, meanwhile, filed various petitions before the top court. One of the petitions has challenged the summoning of the Assembly by the Governor of Maharashtra for conducting the floor test.\nAnother petition challenged the order of the then newly-appointed Speaker removing Ajay Chaudhary and Sunil Prabhu from the posts of leader as well as Chief Whip of the Shiv Sena Legislature Party, respectively.\nThe matter was eventually referred to a Constitution Bench by a Bench headed by then CJI NV Ramana in August last year.\nFurther the top court was also called to decide on which faction of the split party had rights over the Shiv Sena's bow-and-arrow symbol.\nThis was eventually left to the Election Commission to decide.\nOn February 17, the Election Commission (EC) recognised the Shinde faction as the real Shiv Sena based on the majority in the Maharashtra assembly.\nThe Shinde faction has 40 MLAs as against the Thackeray faction's 15 MLAs in the assembly.\nThe issues on which arguments were advanced before the Supreme Court included:\nValidity of the decision of former Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari to ask former Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray to face a floor test.\nValidity of Governor's decision to ask rebel faction leader Eknath Shinde to take oath as Chief Minister.\nPower of the Speaker to act under the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution and whether he could be incapacitated from acting under anti-defection law if a notice seeking his removal from the office is pending.\nWhich faction of a political party can claim to be the real political party in case of a split within the MLAs (legislative wing) of the political party.\nWhether 2016 Supreme Court judgment by a five-judge Constitution Bench in the Nabam Rebia case (relating to the 2016 political crisis in Arunachal Pradesh) which had ruled that a Speaker stands disabled to act under the Tenth Schedule to curb defection, requires to be revisited and referred to a seven-judge bench\nThe Eknath Shinde faction was represented by Senior Advocates Harish Salve, Mahesh Jethmalani, Neeraj Kishan Kaul, Maninder Singh with advocates Chirag Shah, Utsav Trivedi, Himanshu Sachdeva, Manini Roy, Piyush Tiwari and Chaitali Jugran, a team briefed by TAS Law.\nThe Thackeray faction was represented by Senior Advocates Kapil Sibal, Abhishek Manu Singhvi, and Devadatt Kamat, with advocates Rohit Sharma, Nikhil Purohit, Ashok Kumar, Rajesh Inamdar, Javedur Rahman, Nizam Pasha, Anish R Shah, Harsh Pandey, Revanta Solanki, Amit Bhandari, Sunny Jain, Nishant Patil, Devyani Gupta, Tanvi Anand, Aprajita Jamwal, Dharmendra Mishra, Siddharth Kaushik, Siddharth Seem, L Nidhiram Sharma, Aman Sharma, Ashima Chauhan Singh, and Mudassir.\nFollow our coverage of the hearings in the case:\nDay 1: Read story here.\nDay 2: Read story here.\nDay 3: Read story here.\nDay 4: Read story here.\nDay 5: Read story here.\nDay 6: Read story here.\nDay 7: Read story here.\nDay 8: Read story here."}
{"ID": "id_525", "Summary": "In a significant ruling, the Rajasthan High Court recently quashed a condition in a government circular issued in November 2016 and an advertisement published in June 2019, both mandating a woman to be 'married' to get appointed as anganwadi karyakarta, mini karyakarta or a helper [Miss Madhu vs State of Rajasthan].\nSingle-judge Justice Dinesh Mehta held that such a condition denying government employment to an unmarried woman violates her right to equality and right to equal opportunity in public employment.\n\"In the opinion of this Court, depriving a women of public employment on the ground of her being unmarried, apart from being violative of fundamental rights guaranteed to a woman under Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India impinges upon a woman’s dignity,\" the Court held. \nThe single-judge said it was constrained to observe that an entirely 'new front of discrimination' which was not even envisaged or thought of by the framers of the Constitution, has been opened by the State authorities.\n\"Present case is a classic case wherein, the discrimination encountered by women has been given a new facet. An unmarried woman is discriminated against a married woman. The ostensible reason given to support the said condition that an unmarried woman after marriage would migrate to her matrimonial house does not pass muster the test of reasonableness and prudence,\" the Court ruled.\nMere fact that a candidate is unmarried cannot be a reason to disqualify her, the single-judge underscored.\nThe judgment was passed on a plea filed by one Madhu (petitioner) who had applied for a job in the Aangwadi Centre in her village in response to an advertisement published on June 28, 2019.\nThe advertisement was based on a circular issued by the State on November 9, 2016.\nThe advertisement and the circular prescribed that an unmarried woman cannot apply for the jobs advertised.\nThe petitioner highlighted the fact that was a graduate degree holder in Arts and a Computer Proficiency Certificate (RS-CIT).\nWhen she applied for the posts mentioned in the advertisement, she was informed that she was ineligible for the post since she was not married yet.\nSubsequently, the petitioner moved the High Court in 2019 and on July 29, 2019, interim relief was granted to the petitioner with a directive to the authorities to consider her application for the said job.\nIn its final judgment passed on September 4, the High Court said that a host of questions can be posed to the policy makers of the State.\n\"What if, the candidate marries to a boy of the same village or vicinity? What if, a married woman after being engaged as Anganwadi Karykarta moves to other place? What if a woman’s husband decides to live in woman’s parental home? What if, a woman gets widowed or divorced and decides to move to a new place? and What if, a woman does not wish to marry at all!\"\nThese are a few situations which can emerge in some case or the other, the Court opined. \n\"The State can neither pre-empt any such situations nor can it prevent a woman from claiming job simply because she has not tied the nuptial knot,\" the single-judge said.\nThe discrimination which is meted out to the unmarried women is ex-facie illegal, arbitrary and against the very scheme of the Constitution which guarantees equality, the Court stated.\nThe bench further held that a marital status or the condition of a woman to be married to work in Aanganwadi hardly fulfils any object.\n\"The apprehension that after marriage, a women will move onto her matrimonial house is firstly baseless and secondly, it cannot be a reason to justify or protect the offending condition. The condition of a woman to be married being absolutely unconscionable and violative of women’s right to apply and get public employment is liable to be declared arbitrary and unconstitutional,\" the bench observed.\nHowever, the bench granted liberty to the State to take requisite undertaking from the unmarried woman candidates or amend the circular so as to ensure that if a woman having been engaged on any post in any Aaganwadi Centre, migrates to a place other than the area covered by the Centre, on account of marriage or otherwise, her engagement will be brought to an end."}

Considering the facts and background of Reddy as per the officer's report, it determined that he repented committing the offence.\n\"Moreover, the offence committed by the accused is not a grave offence as compared to other offences under the Arms Act. Taking into consideration, the facts and circumstances of the case and also the background of the accused as per the P.O Report and also, it appears that the accused has repented for the offence committed by him,\" the Court stated.\nThe complaint against Reddy was filed by District Commissioner, Bellary, alleging that after his weapon's license expired in 2009, he unlawfully kept it in his possession for nearly two years. Hence, a case was registered against him under Section 25(1-B)(h) of Arms Act.\nReddy's counsel argued that he voluntarily deposited the revolver in November 2011, after the by-elections for the State Legislative Council were declared. He also told the Court that he applied for renewal a week later, after which the concerned authority collected a sum of ₹360 from him to renew his license, and therefore by its conduct, condoned the delay.\nExplaining the delay in renewal, he cited work pressure and stated that he lost the license briefly when his house was being renovated.\nThe Court, however, ruled,\n\"This two fold defence is not at all appealable to the conscious of this court, because, both the limbs cannot sail together, it should have either been work pressure or lost and found theory.\"\nFurther, it said that the acceptance of late fee by the authority will not mean that the accused could get away from the mandate under sub-section (1) of Section 21 of the Arms Act, ordering the deposit of the weapon to the nearest police station on expiry of license.\nAnother defence of the accused was that the burden of intimating him for renewal of the license was on the complainant, but no notice was given to him.\nThe Court underlined that the complaint was not filed for non-renewal, but was filed because the accused failed to deposit the revolver in a police station. \nIt, therefore, convicted the MLA under Section 25(1-B)(h) of the Arms Act.\nHe was released on probation for good conduct subject to certain conditions and was directed to appear before the Court quarterly to file his affidavit for non-violation of the conditions."}

Father is your God and Mother is your Nature. They are the seed you are the Sapling. No whatever good or bad they have in them, even inactive, will become a tree in you. So you inherit your parent’s good and bad both. A person carries some debts due to being born and that includes debt (Spiritual) of Father and Mother which we have to repay,'\" the Court said. \nFurther, the Court noted that in the Mahabharat, when asked what is mightier than the earth and higher than the heavens, Yudhishthira said, “the mother is weightier than the earth; the father is higher than the heaven.”\nThe Court added that even if, for the sake of argument, the father is earning some income, this does not affect the son's duty to maintain his parent. \n\"Even if for the sake of argument, the father earns something; it is pious duty of a son to maintain his old aged father,\" the order stated. \nThe Court was dealing with a criminal revision plea by a man who challenged a March 2023 family court order directing him to pay ₹3,000 as maintenance to his father, aged around 60 years. \nThe father, Deoki Sao, had submitted that he had two sons, Pradip Kumar and Manoj Kumar. He had transferred his land in equal shares to the two in 1994. \nHe added that while his older son, Pradip Kumar had been maintaining him for 15 years, his younger son Manoj Kumar was not maintaining him and was living separately. Deoki Sao also alleged that he was insulted and subjected to assault by his younger son. \nDeoki Sao, therefore, moved an application before the family court seeking ₹10,000 per month as maintenance from Manoj Kumar. \nThe family court's decision to order the payment of ₹3,000 as monthly maintenance, payable by the younger son was then challenged before the High Court. \nThe younger son contended that he has not been neglecting his father and that his father has his own income from agricultural land and a bricks kiln. He argued that his father was able to maintain himself and that the maintenance application was filed only to harass him (younger son).\nThe Court, however, was not persuaded by these arguments. \n\"It is found that the father is having some agricultural land yet is not able to cultivate the same. He also depends upon his elder son, with whom, he resides. The father has given the share in whole property to his younger son Manoj Sao equally but he has not been maintained by his younger son for more than 15 years. Even if for the sake of argument, the father earns something; it is pious duty of a son to maintain his old aged father,\" the Court said.\nThe High Court, therefore, upheld the family court order and dismissed the plea.\nAdvocate Bharat Kumar appeared for the petitioner (son).

{"ID": "id_538", "Summary": "A rape is a rape even if it is committed by the victim's husband, the Gujarat High Court recently observed while highlighting how several countries have criminalised marital rape [Anjanaben Modha vs State of Gujarat].\nSingle-judge Justice Divyesh Joshi in his December 8 order, pointed out that marital rape is illegal in fifty American States, three Australian States, New Zealand, Canada, Israel, France, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Soviet Union, Poland and Czechoslovakia and several other nations.\n\"In the United Kingdom, which the Indian Penal Code (IPC) largely draws from, has also removed the exception (to section 376 which exempts husband from rape charge) pursuant to a judgment in 1991. Therefore, the IPC that was made by the rulers then, has itself abolished the exception given to husbands,\" the Court said. \nTherefore, a man sexually assaulting or raping a woman, is amenable to punishment under Section 376 of the IPC, the order stated.\n\"In most of the cases of such a nature, the usual practice is that if the man is the husband, performing the very same acts that of another man, he is exempted. In my considered view, the same cannot be be countenanced. A man is a man; an act is an act; rape is rape, be it performed by a man the 'husband' on the woman the 'wife',\" Justice Joshi underlined. \nFurther, the Court spoke about the need to change the social attitude of 'boys will be boys' which trivialises or normalises the offences of eve teasing and stalking.\nThe Court pointed out that sexual violence is varied in degree and at the most aggravated level is rape with or without attendant violence. However, there are substantial number of incidents which fall within the rubric of sexual violence, which amounts to offences under various penal enactments.\n\"The outlaw behaviours such as stalking, eve-teasing, shades of verbal and physical assault and harassment. Social attitudes typically characterise this latter category of crimes as 'minor offences.' Such crimes are regrettably not only trivialised or normalised rather they are even romanticised and therefore, invigorated in popular lore such as cinema. These attitudes, which indulgently view the crime through prisms such as 'boys will be boys' and condone them, nevertheless have a lasting and pernicious effect on the survivors,\" Justice Joshi underscored. \nThe Court therefore, opined that the 'silence' on gender violence is needed to be broken.\n\"Gender violence is most often unseen and is shrouded in a culture of silence. The causes and factors of violence against women include entrenched unequal power equations between men and women that foster violence and it's acceptability, aggravated by cultural and social norms, economic dependence, poverty and alcohol consumption,\" the judge observed.\nIn India, the court said, the culprits are often known to the women but the social and economic 'costs' of reporting such crimes are high.\n\"General economic dependence on family and fear of social ostracisation act as significant disincentives for women to report any kind of sexual violence, abuse or abhorrent behaviour. Therefore, the actual incidence of violence against women in India is probably much higher than the data suggests and women may continue to face hostility and have to remain in environments where they are subjected to violence. This silence, needs to be broken,\" the Court stressed. \nIn doing so, men perhaps more than women, have a duty and role to play in averting and combating violence against women, the judge added.\nThese strong observations were made while dismissing a bail application filed by a woman, booked along with her husband and son under charges of rape, outraging modesty, cruelty and criminal intimidation. The Rajkot Cyber Crime Police had also invoked relevant charges under the Information and Technology Act.\nAs per the prosecution case, the woman's daughter-in-law had lodged a complaint against her husband and parents-in-law accusing them of recording her nude videos and photos and uploading the same on a porn website. \nThe complainant alleged that her father-in-law instigated her husband to record their intimate scenes on phone and upload the same on a porn website to earn money. She objected to the same and even complained about it to the father-in-law and the applicant mother-in-law. However, they had connived with her husband and forced her to get recorded on camera, she alleged.\nShe stated that her husband was doing \"unnatural\" things to her on his parents' instigation. \nThe complainant further said that the motive behind these acts was to earn money and avoid getting their hotel sold as they were reeling under financial crisis. \nHaving considered the facts and the material on record, Justice Joshi found that the applicant mother-in-law was aware about the sexual assault and harassment meted out to the complainant.\nWhatever might be the reason behind doing such a heinous and shameful act, the same must be strictly criticised and the accused must be punished in order to prevent commission of such type of offences in future, the judge said.\n\"The applicant, being a lady had not done anything to save the integrity of another lady when she told her about each and everything happened with her. She had to prevent her husband and son from doing such an act and by not doing so, she has played an equal role,\" the Court said while denying bail.  \nAdvocate Urvashi Mehta appeared for the Applicant. \nAdditional Public Prosecutor Manan Mehta represented the State."}

State of Bihar so as to bring about greater clarity regarding the usage of the provision.\"\nImportantly, the Commission further recommended that the scheme of punishment provided under the Section be amended.\nCurrently, it provides for life imprisonment or imprisonment upto 3 years.\nThe Commission has suggested that the jail term of 3 years be enhanced to 7 years.\n\"The 42nd Report of the Law Commission termed the punishment for Section l24Ato be very 'odd'. It could be either imprisonment for life or imprisonment up to three years only, but nothing in between, with the minimum punishment being only fine. A comparison of the sentences as provided for the offences in Chapter VI ofthe IPC suggests that there is a glaring disparity in the punishment prescribed for Section 124A. It is, therefore, suggested that the provision be revised to bring it in consonance with the scheme of punishment provided for other offences under Chapter VI. This would allow the Courts greater room to award punishment for a case of sedition in accordance with the scale and gravity of the act committed,\" the report said.\nSection 124A of IPC, as it stands currently, reads as follows: \nSedition-Whoever by words, either spoken or written, or by signs, or by visible representation, or otherwise, brings or attempts to bring into hatred or contempt, or excites or attempts to excite disaffection towards, the Government established by law in lndia, shall be punished with imprisonment for life, to which fine may be added, or with imprisonment which may extend to three years, to which fine may be added, or with fine. \nHowever, the Law Commission has now recommended to alter the Section as: \n\"Whoever by words, either spoken or written, or by signs, or by visible representation, or otherwise, brings or attempts to bring into hatred or contempt, or excites or attempts to excite disaffection towards, the Government established by law in lndia, with a tendency to incite violence or cause public disorder shall be punished with imprisonment for life, to which fine may be added, or with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to seven years, to which fine may be added, or with fine.\"\nThe expression \"tendency\" would mean mere inclination to incite violence or cause public disorder rather than proof of actual violence or imminent threat to violence, the report clarified. \nThe Commission also suggested that no FIR dealing with Section 124A be registered \"unless a police officer, not below the rank of Inspector, conducts a preliminary inquiry and on the basis of the report made by the said police officer the Central Government or the State Government, as the case may be, grants permission for registering a First Information Report. \"\nTowards this end, the report said that an amendment may be introduced in Section 154 of CrPC by incorporating a proviso. \nResponding to the contention of other countries doing away with the law on sedition, Justice Awasthi led commission opined that \"repealing Section 124A of IPC on the mere basis that certain countries have done so is essentially turning a blind eye to the glaring ground realities existing in India.\"\nOn the argument that sedition law must be scrapped owing to it's colonial legacy, the Commission stated that people are at liberty to indulge in healthy and constructive criticism of their government in a democratic set-up but what Section l24A of IPC seeks to penalise is only the pernicious tendency to incite violence or cause public disorder in the guise of exercising right to freedom of speech and expression."}
{"ID": "id_543", "Summary": "The Madras High Court Monday set aside a special court order to close an illegal land allotment case against Tamil Nadu minister I Periyasamy. \nJustice Anand Venkatesh said that the special court's order was one of \"gross illegality\" and directed Periyasamy to face trial in the case.\n\"The legitimacy of the administration of criminal justice will be eroded and public confidence shaken if MLAs and Ministers facing corruption cases can short-circuit criminal trials by adopting the modus operandi that has been carried out in this case. The public should not be led to believe that a trial against a politician in this State is nothing but a mockery of dispensing criminal justice. A Constitutional Court is duty-bound, under the Constitution, to ensure that such things do not come to pass,\" the judge said while directing the special court to re-commence trial in the case.\nJustice Venkatesh pronounced the verdict on a suo motu revision case that he had initiated against the discharge of the Rural Development Minister in the DMK-led government, Periyasamy from a case of alleged irregular allotment of a Tamil Nadu Housing Board (TNHB) plot to the personal security officer (PSO) of former Chief Minister M Karunanidhi.\nThe Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption (DVAC) had booked Periyasamy after the AIADMK came to power in 2011. \nThe DVAC's case against Periyasamy relates to the allotment of a high-income group plot in Chennai to Karunanidhi's PSO, Ganesan, when Periyasamy served as Housing Minister during the DMK regime in March 2008. \nWhile the then legislative assembly speaker had granted sanction for Periyasamy's prosecution in 2012, the minister filed a discharge petition in 2016 claiming that such sanction should have been granted by the Governor and not the speaker. \nSubsequently, in July 2016, a special court dismissed the discharge application. This order was confirmed by the High Court and the Supreme Court in November and December 2022 respectively.  \nPeriyasamy, however, went on to file another discharge petition before the special court on February 21, 2023, on the ground that the sanction was invalid. \nThis time, the special court accepted the minister's contention and on March 17, 2023, passed an order discharging Periyasamy from the case. This order has now been set aside by the High Court. \nWhile setting aside the special court's order, Justice Venkatesh said that the special court had gone beyond its powers in entertaining and allowing Periyasamy's second plea for discharge.\nThe Court noted that after the High Court and the Supreme Court had upheld the special court's first order dismissing Periyasamy's plea and directed it to commence the trial in the case, the special court should not have acted in defiance by agreeing to hear the minister's second petition seeking the same relief.\nThe Court also said that the special court had erroneously interpreted Section 19 of the Prevention of Corruption Act to hold that only the Governor could be the proper sanctioning authority in Periyasamy's case for the minister was a State government employee and not an officer or employee of the Union government. \n\"The Special Court discharging the 2nd respondent (Periyasamy) from the case on the ostensible ground of a supposed defect/invalidity in sanction under Section 19 of the P.C Act, 1988 suffers from manifest perversity and gross illegality. It is also tainted by procedural impropriety as the Special Court had acted in open defiance of the order dated 11.11.2022 passed by this Court in Crl.R.C 1112 of 2015, Crl.R.C 957 and 983 of 2016 dismissing the first round of discharge petitions and directing the Special Court to proceed with trial. To compound the illegality, the Special Court has discharged the 2 nd respondent (A3) from the case for all eternity as if the order of discharge on the ground of want of sanction operated as an acquittal,\" Justice Venkatesh said.\nIn light of the above, it was clear that the special court's March 2023 order allowing Periyasamy's application for discharge warranted the High Court's intervention, Justice Venkatesh said.\nThe High Court accordingly directed the special court to re-commence trial in the case and also directed Periyasamy and his co-accused to appear before the special court on March 28 this year.\nIn the High Court, Senior Counsel Ranjit Kumar appeared for Periyasamy. Advocate General PS Raman appeared for the DVAC."}

The Police Act does not approve or authorize engagement of a Police Officer on contract basis,\" the judge observed.\nThe Court further asked whether such officers were authorised to conduct the investigation and file a chargesheet.\nThe Court was dealing with a petition challenging the investigation carried out by the State Vigilance Bureau against an Indian Revenue Service (IRS) officer Dheeraj Garg in a corruption case.\nPertinently, the Court was told that the investigating officer in the case was actually a retired officer of the CBI who had been engaged as a Deputy Superintendent of Police by the Anti-Corruption Bureau.\nIt was also submitted that even the charge sheet was filed under the signatures of a Superintendent of Police-ranked officer, who was also a retired officer engaged on a contractual basis as a consultant to guide the investigating officer.  \nIn view of concerns that such contractually appointed officers cannot conduct such investigations, the Court ordered the Haryana State Vigilance Bureau to withdraw the investigation. The Court also stayed further proceedings in the case. \n“The investigation handed over by the State Vigilance Bureau to the persons engaged on contract basis shall henceforth be withdrawn with immediate effect till further orders,” the Court said.\nIn response to the Court's queries, the Anti-Corruption Bureau had earlier defended the appointment of the retired officers on a contract basis, submitting that such engagement had been approved by the Chief Minister.\nAccording to the documents filed in Court, the Director General of the State Vigilance Bureau had sent a proposal to the Vigilance Department for the engagement of CBI officials on a deputation basis. However, the proposal was later changed to allow the engagement of retired officers as consultants, the Court noted. \nThe Court further pointed out that there was no reference in the State’s reply to any law that could allow police officers to be engaged on a contract basis.\nThe Court also noted that a police officer was required to fulfill certain requirements under the Haryana Police Act, 2007.\n“For a person to be 'a member of the Police Service', he has to be in the cadre as per the service jurisprudence since 'Police service' means the 'service constituted under this Act.' The Police Act does not approve or authorize engagement of a Police Officer on contract basis,” the Court observed.\nAn investigation in cases arising out of the Prevention of Corruption Act must be conducted by an officer of the rank of DSP or above, that is, by a Gazetted Officer, the single-judge underscored. \n“It is still not answered as to how the status of a Gazetted Officer could be conferred on a person who had been engaged on a contract basis under an initial engagement proposal as that of a consultant and as to under what order or capacity could he discharge the functions of an Investigating Officer and to file final reports,\" the Court added.\nMeanwhile, the counsel representing the accused IRS officer (petitioner) asserted that the proceedings against him did not satisfy the requirements of law.\nOn November 7, the Court said that the chargesheet filed by the contractual officer in the case “shall not be proceeded any further and the proceedings therein shall remain stayed till the next date of hearing.”\nThe Court will consider the matter again on December 16.\nAdvocates Amandeep Vashisth and Manish Soni represented the petitioner.

Therefore, rape is treated as the most heinous crime against the very basic human right and woman's most important fundamental right, namely 'the right of life.' It is less a sexual offence than an act of aggression aimed at degrading and humiliating women,\" the Court underscored. \nSuch cases are required to be handled by the courts with utmost sensitivity and high responsibility, the judge opined.\nThe Court was hearing a petition filed by the father of a two-year-old girl who was raped in 2004. The petitioner sought compensation for his daughter as per the victim compensation policy of the State government.\nIn its judgment, the Court said that the modern approach of victimology acknowledges the fact that a victim of a crime has the right to be adequately compensated and rehabilitated.\nThe Court held that the Rajasthan Victim Compensation Scheme, 2011 would apply retrospectively and thus, the victim is entitled to get compensation under the said scheme.\n\"Crime of rape committed with the minor victim is a dehumanising one and an affront to human dignity. Hence, compensation should be awarded as a solace to the victim,\" the Court underlined.  \nIt, therefore, held that minor rape victims are entitled to get ₹3 lakh compensation. The amount would be payable even to victims who were subjected to the crime prior to 2009.

{"ID": "id_549", "Summary": "The Supreme Court on Wednesday dismissed a plea filed by activist Gautam Navlakha against a Bombay High Court order rejecting his plea for statutory bail in the Bhima Koreagon violence case (Gautam Navlakha v. NIA).\nThe Court ruled that Navlakha's house arrest was not ordered by the Delhi High Court purporting to be under Section 167 of Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) and thus \"cannot be treated as having been passed under Section 167.\nThe order of house arrest of Navlakha was passed by the Delhi High Court in 2018. \nNavlakha had sought default bail on the ground that the National Investigation Agency (NIA) failed to file its chargesheet within the upper limit of 90 days as prescribed under Section 167(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC).\nIn this regard, it was Navlakha's contention that the period for which he was confined under house arrest in Delhi should be calculated as part of the judicial custody and should be taken into account while deciding the custody period under Section 167(2).\nA Bench of Justices UU Lalit and KM Joseph, however, held that Navlakha's house arrest was not ordered under Section 167. \n\"The High Court of Delhi did not contemplate that the order of house arrest was passed by way of custody under Section 167. We are in this case not sitting in appeal over the legality of the house arrest. But we are here to find whether the house arrest fell under Section 167. We are of the view, that in the facts of this case, the house arrest was not ordered purporting to be under Section 167. It cannot be treated as having being passed under Section 167,\" the judgment said.\nThe Court held that house arrest was, undoubtedly, perceived as the softer alternative to actual incarceration and that was in this \"light that the Court proceeded in the matter.\"\n\"That house arrest, in turn, involved, deprivation of liberty and will fall within the embrace of custody under Section 167 of the CrPC, was not apparently in the minds of both this Court and the High Court of Delhi. This is our understanding of the orders passed by the court,\" the Supreme Court added. \nThe top court was hearing an appeal against a decision of the Bombay High Court which had rejected his plea on February 8. \nA Bench of Justices SS Shinde and MS Karnik of Bombay High Court had rejected the plea on February 8 on the ground that the period for which an accused is under illegal detention cannot be taken into account while computing the 90-day custody period for grant of default bail.\nWhen authorisation by the Magistrate to keep Navlakha under house arrest was declared illegal by Delhi High Court, consequently rendering the detention itself illegal, that period will not be part of the custody period for grant of statutory bail under Section 167 CrPC, the High Court had held.\nIt had, therefore, refused to interfere with the order of the special court which had earlier rejected Navlakha's plea.\nNavlakha, 69, is lodged at Taloja Central jail. He has been seeking statutory bail under the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) on the ground that the NIA did not file its chargesheet within the stipulated 90-day period. \nThe NIA, however, claimed that the period of 34 days of Navlakha’s house arrest between August 29 and October 1, 2018, was termed “illegal” by the Delhi High Court and hence could not be included in the period of detention.\nWith regard to the effect of illegality in the order passed under Section 167, the top court held that if the Court purports to invoke and act under Section 167, the detention will qualify even if there is illegality in the passing of the order. In such cases, what would matter is actual custody, the Court made it clear. \n\"However, when the Court does not purport to act under Section 167, then the detention involved pursuant to the order of the Court cannot qualify as detention under Section 167,\" the top court held.\nOn whether a writ of habeas corpus will lie against an order of remand under Section 167, the Supreme Court held that if \"remand is absolutely illegal or the remand is afflicted with the vice of lack of jurisdiction, a Habeas Corpus petition would indeed lie\". \n\"Equally, if an order of remand is passed in an absolutely mechanical manner, the person affected can seek the remedy of Habeas Corpus. Barring such situations, a Habeas Corpus petition will not lie,\" it was held. \nOver the course of hearing, the Bench sought to know whether the two-day transit period to take Navlakha from Delhi to Mumbai, as well as the period for which he was under house arrest, would be part of the 90-day remand period.\nSupreme Court also answered the question regarding the effect of transit bail and whether it was a production order though sourced under Section 167. \nThe two-judge bench has held that the remand order be it a transit remand order was one which was passed under Section 167 and \"though it may be for the production of the Appellant, it involved authorising continued detention within the meaning of Section 167.\"\nInterestingly, the top court also indulged in a detailed examination of the state of prisons in India.\nIt noted that as per NCRB data, the conditions relating to jails and prisoners was fairly alarming. \nThere were a total number of 1,350 prisons as of the year 2019. 1350 prisons consists of 617 Sub Jails, 410 District Jails, 144 Central Jails, 86 Open Jails, 41 Special Jails, 31 Women Jails, 19 Borstal School and 2 Other than the above jails. \n\"A perusal of the executive summary would reveal an alarming state of affairs as far as 95 occupancy rate is concerned. It has climbed to 118.5 percent in 2019 as on 31st December. The occupancy rate is alarming for male prisoners.

The respondent-firm then filed a complaint under Section 138 of the NI Act 1881.\nIt was the case of the applicant that the summoning order passed by the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate against the applicant was bad in the eyes of law since no statement of the respondent-firm and witnesses was recorded under Sections 200 and 202 of CrPC.\nAdditional Government Advocate appearing for the respondents argued that for passing of the summoning order under the Act, there is no requirement of recording statements under Sections 200 and 202 of the CrPC.\nIt was submitted by the respondents that if, according to the trial court, the complaint discloses a prima facie offence under Section 138 of the NI Act, then the applicant/accused can be summoned.\nAfter examining the summoning order issued against the applicant, the High Court took the view that a prima facie case is made out against the applicant.\nWhile referring to Section 145 (evidence on affidavit) of the NI Act, the Court noted that the evidence of the complainant may be given by him on affidavit, and recording statements is not required with regard to the summoning of accused under Section 138 of the NI Act.\nThe Court observed that:\n\"In the present case, from the perusal of the summoning order dated February 2, 2008, it is apparent that while passing this order, learned Magistrate perused the complaint as well as affidavit filed in support of the complaint filed by opposite party No. 2 and other documents including cheque etc. and, therefore, in view of the Provisions of Section 145 (i) Negotiable Instruments Act, it cannot be said that learned trial court committed any error while summoning the applicant as there was no need to record the statements either under Sections 200 CrPC or 202 CrPC,\" the order said.\nThe High Court thus found no illegality committed by the trial court while passing the summoning order against the applicant.

For the said reason the penalty imposed upon the petitioner is also utterly disproportionate and has no legal sanction,\" the Court said.\nThe act of touching the shoulders of the victim by the petitioner from behind for the sole purpose of restraining her from copying in the examination cannot be said to have any sexual flavour, the bench underscored.\nThe Court, therefore, ordered the reinstatement of the petitioner with full back wages as well as other consequential benefits.\nThe Court also imposed costs of ₹10,000 on the authorities.\nThe petitioner, Anil Kumar Mridha was removed from service by the disciplinary authority on the ground that he had molested a class 8 girl by touching her shoulders from behind in November 2009.\nThe bench noted that despite the petitioner being acquitted from the criminal case on grounds of a 'compromise petition' filed by the victim, who was stated to have filed a false case against him, the disciplinary authority held that since a minor is not competent to enter into a contract, the compromise petition filed by the victim and the petitioner jointly cannot be of any aid to him.\n\"It appears that the petitioner was acquitted from the criminal case on the anvil of a joint compromise petition. The compromise petition cannot be termed as a contract. It clearly demonstrates that the petitioner is innocent and the complaint was falsely lodged against him by the victim,\" the High Court noted.\nIt further observed that though the victim herself had initially stated in her evidence that she was molested by the petitioner, she had subsequently retracted the statement and said that the petitioner had only touched her shoulder from the back while she was copying in the examination. \n\"So also is the version of the victim herself who has in no uncertain terms stated that the petitioner held her by her shoulders when she was copying in the examination. The victim has not for once indicated that the said touch was with sexual intent or inappropriate,\" the bench said.\nThough the authorities tried to impress upon the Court that the petitioner has been penalized for misconduct and not molestation, the article of charge framed against him revealed that the charge of misconduct was based on the alleged molestation for which the criminal court had already exonerated him.\n\"It says that the petitioner committed gross misconduct unbecoming of a government servant inasmuch as he molested one girl student. In other words, the allegation of misconduct is solely on the anvil of the alleged act of molestation,\" the bench observed.\nTherefore, it is ultimately the alleged molestation that has been termed as misconduct on the part of the petitioner, the bench noted. \nSince the petitioner was already acquitted in the molestation case, the Court made it clear that disciplinary action based on that cannot stand. \n\"There is not an iota of evidence on record that suggests misconduct on the part of the petitioner. The statement of the victim is exonerative in nature and gives a clean chit to the petitioner. The decision of the authorities is based on no evidence at all and no misconduct resulting in violation of the service rules has been substantiated against the petitioner,\" the bench held.\nWith these observations, the bench quashed the order of the CAT and ordered the authorities to reinstate the petitioner. It also imposed a cost of ₹10,000 on the authorities.\nAdvocate Anjili Nag appeared for the Petitioners.\nAdvocates Shatadru Chakraborty and Dibesh Dwivedi represented the Authorities."}

Irshad & Anr. versus Nadeem]\nThe Court made the observation while granting a father limited visitation rights of his child.\nThe father had been arrested in 2010 for the dowry death of his wife - the child’s mother. He was acquitted in the case in 2012 and the appeal against acquittal is pending before the High Court.\nMeanwhile, the maternal grandparents moved the family court seeking permanent custody of the child and for a declaration that they are the child's guardians.\nThe same was dismissed leading to the present appeal before the High Court.\nThe division bench of Justice Suresh Kumar Kait and Justice Neena Bansal Sharma said other than the criminal trial, there was no other disqualification brought on record against the child's father.\n“​​The other aspect that has been agitated is that he has since got remarried and has a child from his second marriage, therefore, he cannot be termed as a natural guardian. However, mere second marriage of the father in the circumstances when he has lost his first wife, cannot be held per-se a disqualification from his continuing to be a natural guardian,” it added.\nThe Court further noted that the maternal grandparents have the child’s custody since he was only 1.5 years old and even though the father tried to develop a relationship with the child, it did not yield much result.\n“The child since infancy has been in custody of the appellants. When we had interaction with the child in the chamber who is now about 15 years of age, he revealed that he felt alienated from the father and was comfortable in the custody of the appellants and was being well looked after by them,” it added.\nHowever, the Court said that while there was no doubt the maternal grandparents may have immense love and affection towards the child, it cannot substitute the love and affection of a natural parent.\nEven the disparity in the financial status cannot be a relevant factor for denying the child’s custody to the natural parent, it added.\n“However, in the matters of Guardianship and Custody, we are confronted with the dilemma where the logic may say that the child must be in the custody of his father, but the circumstances and the intelligent preference of the child points otherwise. It may not be in the interest and welfare of the child to uproot him from the family where he is happily entrenched since the age of 1 1⁄2 years,” the Court said further.\nThe bench said the family court while denying the claim of the maternal grandparents, “unfortunately” did not consider the aspect of custody.

The Court took issue with the quota because it had the character of allowing low-ranked students admission to NLUs, at the cost of others.\nNoting that selection on the basis of the quota was unregulated, illegal, and arbitrary, the Court stated:\nThe Bench condemned the \"elitist approach to selected groups\" in the CLAT admission process, and stated that changes in the system were imperative.\nQuoting the Supreme Court's ruling in PA Imamdar v.

{"ID": "id_561", "Summary": "A Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court on Monday unanimously upheld the decision of the Central government to abrogate Article 370 of the Constitution.\nThe decision was rendered by a Bench of Chief Justice of India (CJI) DY Chandrachud and Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul, Sanjiv Khanna, BR Gavai and Surya Kant. \nThe Court held that Article 370 was only intended as a transitory provision and was temporary in character and thus, the President was empowered to abrogate it. \nThe Court further said that Jammu & Kashmir (J&K) ceased to have any internal sovereignty once it acceded to Union of India. \nPertinently, the Court refrained from deciding on the validity of the law that bifurcated J&K into two Union Territories. This was in light of the submission made by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta assuring the Court that the statehood of J&K would be restored. \nDespite these conclusions, what is most interesting is that one part of the Constitutional Order (CO) issued by the President, which set in motion the process of abrogation, was held to be invalid by the Court.\nThis was CO 272 titled The Constitution (Application to Jammu & Kashmir) Order, 2019.\nBut before going into the same, it would be necessary to understand the two clauses of Article 370.\nClause (1)(d) of Article 370\nThe order issued by the President is under this clause. It reads:\n“Notwithstanding anything in this Constitution, such of the other provisions of this Constitution shall apply in relation to that State subject to such exceptions and modifications as the President may by order specify:\nProvided that no such order which relates to the matters specified in the Instrument of Accession of the State referred to in paragraph (i) of sub clause (b) shall be issued except in consultation with the Government of the State:\nProvided further that no such order which relates to matters other than those referred to in the last preceding proviso shall be issued except with the concurrence of that Government.”\nThe clause preceding this clause states that Article 1 and 370 apply to Jammu & Kashmir.\nRead together, this would mean that aside from Articles 1 and 370, all the other Articles in the Constitution will apply to Jammu & Kashmir, subject to the exceptions and modifications made by the President.\nThe same should, however, have consultation or concurrence of the state government – consultation if the subject is in the Instrument of Accession and concurrence if the subject is not in the Instrument of Accession.\nOne of arguments of the petitioners was that such concurrence has to be the concurrence of the elected State government and not of the Union government and the Union Government (acting through the President) could not have given concurrence for issuing a CO 272.\nIn other words, the same could not have been issued when the State was under the President's Rule.\nClause 3 of Article 370\nClause 3 reads:\n“Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing provisions of this article, the President may, by public notification, declare that this article shall cease to be operative or shall be operative only with such exceptions and modifications and from such date as he may specify:\nProvided that the recommendation of the Constituent Assembly of the State referred to in clause (2) shall be necessary before the President issues such a notification.”\nThus, this clause empowers the President to repeal Article 370 or bring about modifications or specify exceptions to the application of Article 370.\nHowever, such a Presidential Order under clause (3) of Article 370 can be issued only upon the recommendation of the Constituent Assembly of Jammu & Kashmir, a body which was dissolved in the 1950s.\nCO 272\nA Presidential Order abrogating or modifying Article 370 could be issued only under Article 370(3), for which the recommendation of the Constituent Assembly of Jammu & Kashmir was required.\nSince the Constituent Assembly of the State had dissolved without recommending abrogation, Article 370 had stood the test of time since the President was virtually powerless to abrogate this Article without a Constituent Assembly.\nThis meant that Article 370 could have remained in the Constitution forever.\nKnowing this, CO 272 issued by the President on August 5, 2019 did not per se make any change directly to Article 370.\nTo get over the hurdle of Constituent Assembly's assent, the President through CO 272 amended Article 367 so that references to the \"Constituent Assembly\" in Article 370(3) were re-interpreted to mean \"Legislative Assembly.\"\nArticle 367 of the Constitution contains nothing but some general rules regarding the interpretation of the Constitution.\nSince, the State was under the President's Rule, 'Legislative Assembly's consent meant Governor's consent.\nImportantly, besides making changes to Article 367, CO 272 also made all provisions of the Constitution of India applicable to Jammu & Kashmir.\nCO 273\nBased on the changes made by CO 272 to Article 367 and consequently to Article 370, the President then issued another Constitutional Order on August 6, 2019, namely CO 273, abrogating Article 370.\nThus, CO 272 amended Article 370(3) by an indirect route of amending Article 367. CO 273 then abrogated the amended Article 370 by virtue of the power given by the amended clause in Article 370(3). \nIndirect amendment to Article 370 by way of CO 272 is not permissible\nThe Supreme Court struck down that portion of CO 272 by which the President had amended Article 367 and, thereby, effectively amended Article 370. \n\"While the change sought to be made by paragraph 2 of CO 272 may appear to be a ‘modification’ or amendment of Article 367 at first blush, its effect is to amend Article 370 itself. Paragraph 2 couches the amendment to Article 370 in the language of an amendment or modification to Article 367 but its true import is to amend Article 370,\" the Court said.\nExplaining further, the Court held,\n\"CO 272 purports to add Clause 4 to Article 367 and stipulates that the expression ‘Constituent Assembly’ in the proviso to Article 370(3) shall be read as ‘Legislative Assembly.’ The proviso to Article 370(3) states that the recommendation of the Constituent Assembly referred to in Clause 2 is necessary. Clause 2 of Article 370 refers to the Constituent Assembly for the purpose of framing the Constitution of the State. Thus, the proviso to Article 370(3) confers the power to make recommendations to that specific Constituent Assembly. CO 272 changes the language to the proviso to Article 370(3) in two ways. First, it changes the recommending body from the Constituent Assembly to the Legislative Assembly; and second, it makes a new arrangement at variance with that specific Constituent Assembly.\" \nBoth these changes are not insignificant, because they modify the essential character of the proviso by substituting a particular type or kind of body with another type or kind entirely, the Court said.\nWhile an interpretation clause can be used to define or give meaning to particular terms, it cannot be deployed to amend a provision by bypassing the specific procedure laid down for its amendment. This would defeat the purpose of having a procedure for making an amendment, the Court held.\nCO 272 upheld because President has unilateral powers\nBesides the challenge based on the indirect route taken by the President, the challenge to CO 272 was based on two other grounds.\nOne, that the Centre could not have done it unilaterally when the State was under President's Rule, and two, that the power under Article 370(1)(d) cannot be used to apply all provisions of the Constitution to Jammu & Kashmir. \nIt is on these grounds that the Court upheld CO 272. \nThe Court held that the President can unilaterally exercise his powers and seek the concurrence of the Union government instead of the State government for applying all provisions of the Constitution to J&K.\nThe consultation and collaboration between the President and the State government was required only where the application of the provisions of the Indian Constitution to the State would require amendments to the State Constitution. \n\"Consultation and collaboration between both the units (President and State government) will only be necessary where the application of the provisions of the Indian Constitution to the State would require amendments to the State Constitution because the purpose of the requirements of consultation and collaboration is for the smooth functioning of governance in the State and to ensure that the provisions of the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir are not inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution of India,\" the Court said.\nSince the effect of applying all provisions of the Constitution to Jammu & Kashmir through the exercise of power under Article 370(1)(d) is the same as issuing a notification under Article 370(3) (which the President has the power to unilaterally issue), the principles of consultation and collaboration are not required to be followed, the Bench ruled.\n\"The exercise of power is mala fide only if power was exercised with an intent to deceive. Deception can only be proved if the power which is otherwise unavailable to the authority or body is exercised or if the power that is available is improperly exercised. Since the concurrence of the State Government was not required for the exercise of power under Article 370(1)(d) to apply all provisions of the Constitution to the State, the President securing the concurrence of the Union of India (on behalf of the State Government) is not mala fide,\" the judgment stated.\nThe Court also held that the President can apply all provisions of the Constitution of India to J&K, the proviso to Article 370(1)(d) notwithstanding.\n\"Non-application of mind cannot be claimed merely because the CO 272 applies all provisions of the Constitution to Jammu and Kashmir in one go,\" the Court ruled.\nWhy CO 273 was also upheld\nThis perhaps was the most significant aspect of the top court's ruling.\nCO 273, which abrogated Article 370, was challenged on the ground that the Constituent Assembly of J&K which could recommend its dissolution, had ceased to exist.\nIn other words, it was argued by the petitioners the President could not have unilaterally issued a CO abrogating Article 370 by amending the proviso to Article 370(3) and replacing the term 'Constituent Assembly' with 'Legislative Assembly'.\nWhile the Court held that the procedure adopted to replace 'Constituent Assembly' with 'Legislative Assembly' was invalid, it said that the President could still issue CO 273. \nThis, the Court said, was because Article 370(3) was introduced with the object of Constitutional integration and not disintegration. \n\"Articles 370(1)(d) and 370(3) were introduced with the purpose of enhancing constitutional integration and not disintegration. So, the power under Article 370(1)(d) and Article 370(3) even when exercised to its fullest extent does not freeze the system of integration contemplated by Article 370 but is rather intended to enhance constitutional integration between the Union and the State of Jammu and Kashmir,\" the judgment said. \nHolding that the power under Article 370(3) cannot be exercised after the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly would lead to the freezing of the process of integration, contrary to the purpose of introducing the provision, the Court said. \nFurther, the Court opined that this was not a case where only Articles 1 and 370 of the Constitution were applied to Jammu & Kashmir and suddenly after seventy years the entire Constitution was being made applicable. \nThe continuous exercise of power under Article 370(1) by the President indicates that the gradual process of constitutional integration was ongoing. The declaration issued by the President in exercise of the power under Article 370(3) is a culmination of the process of integration.\nElections should be held in J&K\nThe Court directed the Election Commission of India to hold elections to the Legislative Assembly of J&K by September 30.\n\"We direct that steps shall be taken by the Election Commission of India to conduct elections to the Legislative Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir constituted under Section 14 of the Reorganisation Act by September 30, 2024. Restoration of statehood shall take place at the earliest and as soon as possible,\" the Court directed.\nLadakh's status as UT upheld\nThe Court, however, upheld the validity of the decision to carve out the Union Territory of Ladakh in view of Article 3(a) read with Explanation I, which permits forming a Union Territory by separation of a territory from any State.\n\"The Solicitor General submitted that the status of the Union Territory of Ladakh will not be affected by the restoration of statehood to Jammu and Kashmir,\" the Court noted."}

{"ID": "id_566", "Summary": "Jute industry is nation's pride and it is important for all stakeholders to not only save but revive the jute industry, the Calcutta High Court recently said [Indian Jute Mills Association vs Union Of India].\nJustice Amrita Sinha, taking note of the financial losses incurred by jute mills, said all organs of the government need to support the Jute Commissioner to act against those indulging in hoarding of the raw fibre.\n\"All the parties who are a part of the jute industry need to adopt a holistic approach and devise means not only to save but to revive the industry which is the pride of our country, especially Bengal. Reviving the industry will undoubtedly be a herculean task and joint effort of all stake holders is extremely important,\" the single-judge said.\nThe Jute Commissioner is statutorily required to lead from the front, the Court added. \nThe Court was hearing a petition filed by the Indian Jute Mills Association challenging a notification issued by the Jute Commissioner of the Union Ministry of Textiles, in June last year under the Jute Textiles Control Order of 2016.\nAs per the notification, the Jute Commissioner had notified ₹6,500 per quintal as the reasonable price for raw jute in respect of TD-5 variety in West Bengal.\nThe notification mandated that no dealer, trader, agency or supplier or any other person shall sell or offer to sell any person or agency and no person, agency or company shall offer to purchase or purchase any raw jute at a price exceeding the reasonable price mentioned in the notification.\nThe petitioners comprising over 35 jute mills, contended that the rate fixed by the commissioner was not reasonable as it did not consider the charges on account of freight, transportation, handling and storage cost of raw jute and it was contrary to the 2016 Control Order. \nThe price fixed is absurdly low and cannot be implemented even with coercive measures, it was contended. \nThe petitioners pointed out that since the fixed rate was not reasonable, they were being forced to procure raw jute at higher rates. \nSince they cannot sell their final products in the open market but have to sell the finished jute bags in bulk to the government, they are undergoing sustained financial loss meaning most mills have been compelled to shut down.\nAccordingly, a prayer was made to direct the authorities to re-fix the rates.\nHaving heard the contentions, the single-judge noted that the Court was not an expert body to fix the price of any product but it is the task of the Jute Commissioner. \n\"An onerous duty is cast upon the Jute Commissioner. It is not only his statutory duty but an obligation to fix the price of raw jute after taking into account the relevant considerations and to adopt all necessary methods to implement the said price, otherwise the price fixed will lose its relevance and the purchasers will be left at the mercy of the traders who are openly selling the product at rates higher than the notified rate,\" the Court said. \nThe judge added that \"something is going wrong somewhere\" as the price of raw jute was spiralling upwards instead of coming down.\n\"There must be some loop holes which are required to be plugged. But who will bell the cat, is possibly the next relevant question. Taking advantage of the difference between the State and the Central, the hoarders and black marketers are taking active role in selling raw jute at an exorbitant rate,\" the judge noted.\nRaising the notified rate would not be the solution to the problem faced by the mills, the judgment further opined. \n\"A check and balance is to be maintained. With a rise in the notified rate, the government will be liable to reimburse the mill owners the higher rate, which in turn will put a pressure on the exchequer and most likely, the higher rate will not reach the hands of the poor cultivators and will fizzle out in the middle rung,\" the Court said. \nThe judge, therefore, ordered the Jute Commissioner to take positive steps and adopt stringent measures to implement the notified rate.\nEven so, if it appears that the notified rate cannot be adhered to, then the he shall review and re-fix the rate after taking into consideration the relevant factors as mentioned in the 2016 Control Order, the Court directed. \nSenior Advocate Abhrajit Mitra with advocates Rajshree Kaharia, Sarvopriyo Mukherjee, Satadeep Bhattacharyya, Uttam Sharma appeared for the petitioners. \nAssistant Solicitor General Dhiraj Trivedi with advocates Dibashis Basu and Arun Bandyopadhyay appeared for the Union government.\nSenior Advocate Jayanta Kumar Mitra with advocates Joydip Banerjee and Rahul Karmakar appeared for the Jute Commissioner.\nAdvocates Susovan Sengupta and Manas Kumar Sadhu appeared for the State.\nAdvocates Saikat Basu, Abhishek Acharya, Soumya Mazumdar, Kumar Gupta, and Pranav Sharma appeared for the remaining respondents."}

The wife before the Family Court had alleged that she was harassed sexually, mentally and physically by the husband.\nSubsequently, she moved the Family Court invoking relevant provisions of the Protection of Women from Domestice Violence Act, 2005 and the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890.\nSince then, she has been living in a rented apartment at Defence Colony, New Delhi.\nBefore Justice Prasad, the wife contended that the husband hasn't been complying with the Family Court's orders. She pointed out that the husband hasn't paid ₹80,000, the salary of a nanny appointed for their only son.\nOn the other hand, the husband submitted that he has been making all the payments ordered by the Family Court. He further pointed out that the son doesn't require any special care further and the wife was only seeking to cause hardship to him by expanding the scope of the orders passed by the Family Court.\nAfter considering the rival arguments, the judge noted that the husband had filed an income and expenditure affidavit, which indicated that he was spending around ₹8.90 lakh per month to maintain his wife and son.\n\"A perusal of the income and expenditure affidavit shows that the husband was spending ₹8,90,947 per month for the purpose of maintaining the wife and the minor son. It is pertinent to mention at this juncture that the husband was residing with the wife at the time when the income and expenditure affidavit had been filed. Subsequent to the filing of the income and expenditure affidavit, he shifted out from the said premises. However, the expenditure has not been reduced despite the fact that he has moved out from the premises......It has been submitted he has been paying a sum of ₹4.5 lakhs towards the rent of the serviced apartment. He is also paying a sum of ₹1,30,937 per month towards the payment for the housekeeper and cook's room rent, and ₹76,744 per month for the payment of the salary of the housekeeper and the cook,\" Justice Prasad noted.\nThe Court, therefore, said that the controversy before it was restricted to whether non-payment of salary for the nanny would amount to contempt or not. \nThis, the Court said, would be a matter of interpretation of the order of the Family Court. \nIn this regard, the Court noted that the argument by the husband that the nanny appointed at the time of filing of the income and expenditure affidavit was a medical specialist and had been appointed at a time when the minor son was not in good health. However, that position does not continue as of today, it was pointed out. \nIn view of the changed circumstance, the Court agreed with the husband's argument that ₹80,000 for nanny is excessive. \n\"In wake of the changed circumstances, this Court is of the considered opinion that a sum of ₹80,000 is highly excessive for a nanny who has been employed to take care of a child,\" the judge held.\nThe husband, further highlighted the fact that he had paid ₹24 lakh to the wife that would cover her expenses till January 2022. \nIn view of the facts set out, the Court held that there was no wilful disobedience on the husband's part in fulfilling the directions given to him by the Family Court.\nSenior Advocates Geeta Luthra and Rebecca John represented the wife and the husband respectively."}

{"ID": "id_571", "Summary": "The Supreme Court on Thursday held that reopening of inquiry into caste certificates can be done only when there is fraud or when they were issued without proper inquiry (J Chitra vs District Collector & SDVC Tamil Nadu).\nThe Bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao and Aniruddha Bose held that the “purpose of verification of caste certificates by scrutiny committees is to avoid false and bogus claims.”\n“Repeated inquiries for verification of caste certificates would be detrimental to the members of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. Reopening of inquiry into caste certificates can be only in case they are vitiated by fraud or when they were issued without proper inquiry,” the judgment said.\nThe judgment was rendered on an appeal by a Scheduled Caste government officer, J Chitra (appellant) against whom there was an inquiry with respect to her caste certificate based on a complaint by Dr. Ambedkar Service Association. \nDistrict Level Vigilance Committee had initially upheld the community certificate in favour of the appellant which showed her to be from a Scheduled Caste community. The decision of the District Level Vigilance Committee in the year 1999 was not challenged in any forum.\nLater another complaint was filed and on the basis of that she was again subjected to inquiry. The matter was first heard by the State Level Scrutiny Committee which remanded the matter to District Vigilance Committee. The District Vigilance Committee then conducted a hearing before cancelling the certificate.\nShe appealed against such a rejection before Madras High Court which rejected her appeal. This led to the present plea before the Supreme Court.\nThe top court noted that recognition of the community certificate issued in favour of the appellant by the District Vigilance Committee had become final and that the State Level Scrutiny Committee did not have jurisdiction to reopen the matter and remand the matter for fresh consideration by the District Level Vigilance Committee.\nIn this regard, the Court placed reliance on the Government Order dated September 12, 2007. \n“The guidelines issued by G.O.108 dated 12.09.2007 do not permit the State Level Scrutiny Committee to reopen cases which have become final,” stated the Supreme Court.\nThe Court, therefore, held that in view of the conclusion that the State Level Scrutiny Committee did not have the power to reopen the matter relating to the caste certificate that was approved by the District Vigilance Committee in the year 1999 without any appeal filed against that order, it is not necessary for to deal with the submissions relating to the correctness of the findings recorded by the District Vigilance Committee in 2008.\nIt thus, allowed the appeal and set aside the 2008 order of District Vigilance Committee."}

In such a case, it cannot be held that the overt act alleged by the defacto complainant is one (that) arose out of consent,\" the Court observed. \nThe Court found that, prima facie, the allegations against the accused were made out. \nAs such, the Court found that the bar on granting pre-arrest bail in offences under the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act (SC/ST Act) would apply.\n\"Therefore, the prosecution allegations are well made out prima facie and as such anticipatory bail cannot be granted in view of the specific bar under Section 18 and 18A of the SC/ST Act,\" the Court held.\nA special court dealing with SC/ST Act offences had earlier dismissed the accused man's plea for anticipatory bail, prompting him to approach the High Court for relief. \nThe man (appellant) stood charged with offences punishable under Sections 354(A)(1)(i) (sexual harassment), 506 (criminal intimidation), and 376(2)(n) (dealing with punishment for rape) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), apart from Section 3(2)(v) of the SC/ST Act.\nThe appellant asserted before the High Court that he and the complainant were in a relationship and that she had lodged a false rape complaint after their relationship became strained.\nThe prosecution, on the other hand, asserted that the accused had committed rape after giving the complainant some noxious liquid, which rendered her semi-conscious. The prosecution also alleged that the accused man had threatened and raped her on other occasions as well after the said incident.\nThe Public Prosecutor added that even if there was a love affair between the complainant and the appellant, the rape charge would stand since the appellant had given a noxious liquid to the complainant and made her semi-conscious to avoid her resistance to sexual intercourse. \nMeanwhile, an audio recording of a phone call between the complainant and the appellant was relied on by the appellant's counsel to assert that the relations between the two were cordial even after the alleged incident. The appellant's counsel argued that the complainant ruined the cordial relations by foisting a false case. \nThe High Court, however, opined that the recording may also indicate that there was sexual abuse involved.\n\"Going by the telephonic conversations also, though cordial relationship could be seen, the occurrence as narrated by the defacto complainant in the matter of sexual abuse could be foreseen,\" the Court said. \nHence, the Court concluded that a prima facie case had been made out against the appellant and rejected his plea for anticipatory bail."}

Even though the power of this Court under Section 482 Cr.PC is very wide; when it comes to the question of quashing an FIR, the same can be invoked only in the rarest of rare cases. I do not find that this is a case that falls in that category, and hence I do not find any circumstances warranting interference in this case. Therefore the prayer for quashing Annexure-9 FIR is hereby declined,\" the order stated.\nThe Court further opined that even if the allegations may not reveal the offences alleged at this nascent stage of the investigation, the benefit of doubt must go to the investigating authorities and not the accused. \n\"Even if what is revealed from the allegations is a doubtful case for making out the offences, in my view, at the stage of FIR, the benefit of the doubt should go in favour of the investigation and not to the accused. This is mainly because, an interference in the investigation at this stage would foreclose all opportunities for the police to collect materials in support of the allegations. In my view, the duty of the court is not confined to seeing that no innocent person is punished but also to ensuring that proper punishment is granted to the real culprits. Therefore a balance has to be struck, and I find that a proper balancing can be made in this case, by allowing the investigation to continue,\" the Court said in its order.\nDileep and his associates are already being tried by the Additional Sessions (CBI special No III) Court in Ernakulam for allegedly planning and executing a revenge crime against a prominent actress by having her abducted, sexually assaulted and photographed in a moving vehicle.\nThe trial which has seen its share of controversies was nearing completion when a film director, Balachandra Kumar, gave an interview to media and released some audio clips indicating close association between Dileep, who is the 8th accused in the case, and Pulsar Suni, the 1st accused. \nThe clips and Kumar's statements allegedly revealed a conspiracy to kill the police officers who were involved in the investigation of the actress assault case. \nThis led to registration of a fresh FIR against Dileep and five others for offences punishable under Sections 116 (offering bribe to public servant), 118 (concealing design to commit offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) read with Section 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code.\nOn February 7, the Kerala High Court granted the accused, including Dileep, anticipatory bail in the matter.\nSubsequently, he approached the High Court to quash further investigation into the 2017 actress assault case but the same was declined by the Court.\nLater, Dileep approached the Court, by way of the present plea, to quash all further proceedings in the case of alleged conspiracy to murder police officers. Alternatively, he also prayed that the investigation in the case be transferred from the Crime Branch of the State Police to another investigating agency such as the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).\nBoth reliefs sought for by Dileep were declined by the High Court in its order. \nDileep was represented by represented by Senior Advocate Siddharth Agarwal and advocates Philip T Varghese, Thomas T Varghese, Achu Shubha Abraham, Litha VT, Monisha KR and Nitya R.\nThe Prosecution was led by Director General of Prosecution, Senior Advocate TA Shaji, instructed by Senior Public Prosecutor P Narayanan.\nRead a summary of the hearings here."}

All questions that may arise reasonably in the mind of a prudent man, must receive answer from the evidence that has been brought on record. Merely that the victim has spoken in the trial Court would not be sufficient and safe to rely on the same blind-folded as a foundation of his guilt,\" the bench observed.\nThe quality of evidence, the bench emphasised, must inspire confidence in the mind of the trial judge for the court to rely solely on the victim’s evidence and not go for any other corroboration. \nThe High Court, however, found that the evidence of the victim in this case did not inspire such confidence. \n\"There are missing links existent pre-dominantly, raising strong doubt as regards reasonability for what the victim has stated the trial Court. The same could not have been relied on, in the same manner as it has been done, for the reason of its insufficiency, non-specificness and in coherence,\" the bench opined.\nThe case pertained to an alleged incident that took place on the night of July 1, 2004, when the octogenarian mother of the complainant was preparing 'papads' to sell the same. \nHowever, when the appellant-accused requested some 'papads' and offered to pay the money later, the complainant refused to give the same. The complainant insisted that the appellant pay the pending dues first.\nWith this, there was an argument and the appellant allegedly poured hot mustard oil on the complainant's mother causing grievous injuries to her.\nThe bench examined the testimony of the doctor who treated the victim just after the incident and accepted the fact that the woman indeed suffered 36 percent burn injuries. The judge, however, noted that two independent witnesses, who were residents of the same village, were declared hostile as they said that the burn injuries were due to an accident. \n\"Evidence of the victim however lacks sufficiency so far as the appellant’s specific and overt acts are concerned. She has stated that being infuriated due to her asking lack some old and outstanding dues, the appellant poured oil on her person.

The finding of the trial Court that the appellant put out hot oil from the utensils being used by the victim and poured the same upon her person, has been only baseless and imaginary, in so far as none of the witnesses including the victim has specified the manner of incident,\" the bench held.\nWith these observations, the Court acquitted the appellant.\nAdvocate Somopriyo Chowdhury was served as Amicus Curiae and represented the appellant.\nAdvocates Pravash Bhattacharyya and MFA Begg represented the State."}
{"ID": "id_588", "Summary": "Some wounds are better left unattended to be ministered by nature with ointment of time, a Delhi court recently said while dismissing a man’s plea against the cancellation report filed by the police in connection with the death of his daughter in 2008 [V K S v. State].\nThe order under challenge had dismissed the man's protest petition and accepted the cancellation report filed by the police ruling out any foul play and stating it to be a case of suicide.\nAlthough the grieving father’s pain was stated to be understandable, Additional Sessions Judge Anuj Aggarwal observed, \n\"The court is not cure all. Some wounds are better left unattended to be ministered by nature with an ointment of time. The court cannot however administer placebo to the revisionist in the name of panacea.”\nTo arrive at this conclusion, the Court referred to the opinions of three different experts who concluded that it was a case of suicide by partial hanging and ruled out the possibility of any foul play. The order junking the father’s protest petition was, therefore, stated to have “no infirmity.”\nA murder case under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code was registered after the victim was found lying on a bed with a wire tied around her neck. The other end of the wire, it had come on the record, was found tied to one of the legs of a table adjacent to the bed. A flatmate of hers found her lying motionless and alerted the landlord, who reported the incident to the police.\nThe police found that there was only a single entry and exit to the rooms occupied by the women, who lived on a sharing basis. The gate had an inbuilt lock and all the occupants had a separate key. The acquaintances the deceased was in touch with were thoroughly interrogated after the incident.\nThe case file was submitted to the department of forensic medicine, Maulana Azad Medical College for its opinion on whether it was a case of homicide or suicide. An expert at the College, as well as the Director of Medico Legal Institute, Bhopal concluded that it was a suicide.\nThereafter, the police filed a cancellation report, which was accepted on July 13, 2012 by a magistrate court. In that order, it was observed, \n“It was a case of self strangulation in a lying down position. The photographs coupled with the expert opinion leaves no doubt that it was a case of suicide.”\nThe father, through his counsel, challenged the order stressing that there were injuries on the deceased’s body and her physical state suggested that she was raped and murdered.\n“Magistrate failed to appreciate that the scene of crime indicated that there was violence in the room as ear phone of deceased was found broken indicating that she was subjected to physical assault,” the counsel submitted.\nThe order under challenge was also stated to be completely silent on the issues raised by man in his protest petition filed against the cancellation report.\nThe State, on the contrary, argued that the Magistrate Court had rightly observed that there was no merit in the protest petition as the revisionist’s objections were “frivolous”.\nThe Court held that under revision jurisdiction, it was not expected to substitute its own view with that of the trial court unless the latter’s order suffered from a jurisdictional error or a patent infirmity.\n“In the instant case, as evident from record, the Magistrate while narrating (in detail) the facts, crime scene and expert opinion, passed a well reasoned detailed order, thereby accepting the cancellation report while brushing aside the protest petition of the revisionist and therefore, this court cannot and rather ought not substitute its own view with that of the Magistrate (while exercising its revision jurisdiction) and thereby arriving at a different conclusion,” it held."}

Later, the applicant also confessed in his statement given under Section 67 of NDPS Act that he purchased the seized contraband using his own money.\nThe Court took note of the fact that the applicant-accused was not named in the FIR nor was he present on spot. Further, no recovery was made from the accused-applicant.\nHis name came to light based on the confessional statements of co-accused Rakesh and Veerpal recorded under section 67 of the NDPS Act stating that they were transporting the seized ganja to Aligarh on the instructions of the accused applicant, the Court noted.\nFurther, the NCB had also relied upon the statement of applicant himself Section 67 of NDPS Act. But the Court said that law laid down by Supreme Court would come to the aid of the accused. \nIn Tofan Singh it was held that \"a confessional statement made before an officer designated under Section 42 orSection 53 can be the basis to convict a person under the NDPS Act, without any non obstante clause doing away with Section 25 of the Evidence Act, and without any safeguards, would be a direct infringement of the constitutional guarantees contained in Articles 14, 20 (3) and 21 of the Constitution of India.\"\nThus, the High Court held that the complicity of the applicant will have to be determined based on the quality of evidence led during trial. \n\"As far as the self inculpatory statement relied upon, this Court is prima facie of the opinion that the ratio as laid down in Tofan Singh's case would come to the aid of the applicant to allow him the benefit of regular bail,\" the Court stated.\nThe Court further noted that though the co-accused stated that the truck seized belonged to the applicant, the prosecution failed to bring on record any documentary evidence to establish the ownership of the applicant-accused in respect of the seized vehicle.\nLastly, while granting bail to the applicant, the Court said that there are \"reasonable grounds in terms of Section 37 of NDPS Act to believe that the applicant accused is not guilty of an offence and he is not likely to commit any offence while on bail.

Subsequently, a first information report (FIR) was registered against 24 prisoners.\nBesides other charges, Section 130 (aiding escape of, rescuing or harbouring such prisoner) of the Indian Penal Code was invoked on the ground that 14 of the prisoners were facing charges of waging war against the State and other terror charges. Thus, it was contended that they were all State Prisoners.\nThe Sessions Court had discharged the prisoners on the ground that Section 130 could not be invoked against them since they did not fall under the definition of 'State Prisoners'. The State subsequently approached the High Court in appeal.\nAfter hearing the prosecution arguments, the Court gathered that the accused are well-educated and some of them had Engineering and MBA degrees.\nOn how the prisoners prepared for their escape from Sabarmati Central Prison, the Court noted,\n\"...accused No.1 (Hafizhusain) was the Civil Engineer, who took the measurement from the distance from jail to outside jail and planned as to how long and deep the tunnel would be. It is further alleged that all the other accused got the equipment to dig-up the tunnel, cover it up if any jail officer visited, distract them etc., and to understand the technique of digging up the tunnel where the accused had got four books from library.\"\nThe prisoners had dug the tunnel between October, 11 2012 and February 12, 2013, until the jail officer found it.\n\"The officers found out that a big tunnel was dug up near the water-tank behind the big tree which was approximately six feet deep and around 196 feet long, which is outside the jail campus,\" the Court noted.\nJustice Nanvati said that the Sessions Court should have had avoided going into technicalities, and ought to have only considered whether or not there was a prima facie case against the prisoners.\n\"This Court is not required to consider whether the case of the accused fall within the definition or explanation of 'State Prisoners' as the same would be subject matter of evidence. At this stage, it is only required to consider from the evidence on record whether a prima facie case is made out against them,\" the order stated.\nThe Court, therefore, allowed the State's application and quashed the Sessions Court order.\nPublic Prosecutor Mitesh Amin and Additional Public Prosecutor Maithili Mehta appeared for the State.\nAdvocates DD Pathan, Khalid G Shaikh and SM Vatsa represented the prisoners."}

It is not proper to come to a conclusion that only because an adjournment has been granted, the integrity of a Judge has to be doubted. It is a matter of fact that whenever a matter is listed, that too, for arguments, the learned counsels always seek time to either prepare themselves or for other reasons. An adjournment may be granted. Therefore, we do not think that this could be held against the concerned Judge,\" the High Court ruled.\nThe Court was hearing the petitioner’s challenge to an order of compulsory retirement passed against him by the High Court on the administrative side.\nHe was charged for granting bail contrary to law and for granting frequent adjournments showing lack of devotion to his work.\nThe court found that such serious consequences could not be based on inferences.\n“It is needless for us to state that whenever a man is being punished and that too with such serious consequences, the same cannot be as a result of an inference.”\nThe allegations against the petitioner were with reference to orders passed by him while he was serving as an Additional District Judge at Guna. The Enquiring Officer’s report exonerated him of all the charges. However, the High Court disagreed with these findings and eventually, issued the order under challenge.\nThe petitioner challenged the order on the grounds that he was not granted an opportunity of personal hearing, and there were no complaints against the him throughout his service.\nThe bench opined that the findings regarding grant of bail with a corrupt motive or extraneous considerations was drawn on the basis of an inference, and thus, could not be upheld.\nDealing with the allegation of grant of adjournments, the division bench stated that whether or not a judge was justified in granting adjournments cannot be ascertained by merely looking at the order sheets.\n“We fail to understand as to how the Disciplinary Authority comes to a conclusion that even the leniency to be shown by the Judges to the Bar requires to be ascertained in a microscopic examination,” the Court said.\nMany submissions, requests and such events that take place in the open court are best left between the discussions of the Bar and the Bench and not recorded, it was further noted.\n“It is not necessary that each and every word that an advocate states in an open Court requires to be transcribed into the order sheets.

The hypothalamus and pituitary gland control the amount of testosterone, which is primarily responsible for sex urge and libido (in men). It’s existence is there in the body, so when the respective gland becomes active by stimulation, sexual urge is aroused,\" the Court said.\nBut activation of the respective responsible gland is not automatic as it needs stimulation by our sight, hearing, reading erotic materials, and conversation with the opposite sex, the Court said.\nSo, the bench opined that sexual urge is created by our own action.\n\"Sex in adolescents is normal but sexual urge or arousal of such urge is dependent on some action by the individual, maybe a man or woman. Therefore, sexual urge is not at all normal and normative. If we stop some action(s), arousal of sexual urge, as advocated in our discussion supra, ceases to be normal,\" the judgment said.\nThe bench, therefore, proposed a 'duty/obligation based approach' to the issue, and suggested some duties for both the adolescent females and males.\nDuties of adolescent females\nFor adolescent females, the Court suggested:\nIt is the duty/obligation of every female adolescent to:\n(i) Protect her right to integrity of her body.\n(ii) Protect her dignity and self-worth.\n(iii) Thrive for overall development of her self transcending gender barriers.\n(iv) Control sexual urge/urges as in the eyes of society she is the looser when she gives in to enjoy the sexual pleasure of hardly two minutes.\n(v) Protect her right to autonomy of her body and her privacy.\nDuties for adolescent males\nFor adolescent boys, the Court said, \n\"It is the duty of a male adolescent to respect the aforesaid duties of a young girl or woman and he should train his mind to respect a woman, her self worth, her dignity and privacy, and right to autonomy of her body.\"\nSex education, parental guidance\nThe Court also emphasised the significance of guiding and educating adolescents about issues surrounding sexuality. \nFor this purpose, the bench said charity should begin at home and parents should be the first teachers.\n\"We therefore feel that parental guidance and education to children specially the girls to recognise bad touch, bad signs, bad advances and bad company is necessary especially with emphasis on their health and reproductive system to have sex at an age not sanctioned by law,\" the bench observed.\nSimilarly, parental guidance and education so far as boys are concerned should include how to respect a woman, how to keep dignity of a woman, how to protect the integrity of body of a woman and how to befriend a woman without being aroused by sexual urge even if there is advances from the other side till he becomes capable to maintain a family.\n\"The family where a child is there should maintain such a conducive atmosphere in the house that no kid grows up believing that it is 'OK' to violate women. We should never ever think that only a girl is subject to abuse, because there is no escape for a boy even now-adays,\" the bench underlined.\nBesides the parental guidance, requisite sex education with emphasis on these aspects and reproductive health and hygiene should be a part of the curriculum of every school, the Court said.\nAdvocates Malay Bhattacharyya, Subhrajyoti Ghosh and Dibakar Sardar appeared for the Appellant.\nAdditional Public Prosecutor PK Datta, along with Advocates Ashok Das and SD Roy represented the State.\nAdvocates Shibaji Kumar Das, Soumyajit Das Mahapatra, Rupsa Sreemani and Madhuraj Sinha represented the Victim.\nRead more about the judgment here."}

It, therefore, determined that the petitioners had not approached the Court with clean hands.\n\"A bare perusal of the objects of the society clearly show that to promote ecology is not the object of the society. The said statement in the PIL as set out above is not at all correct. It is further significant to note that the petition has been affirmed by the petitioner no.2 who has nothing to do with the petitioner no.1-society. As set out earlier how the petitioner no.1 is concerned with the petitioner no.2 is not at all disclosed in the PIL petition. Thus, it is clear that the petitioners have not approached this Court with clean hands,\" it said.\nThe society, Sarthi Seva Sangh, approached the court through advocate Ranjit Bhosale seeking setting aside of a redevelopment plan granting additional Floor Space Index (FSI) to a plot in Worli considering that the notional plot area was double of actual physical area. Thus, it sought demolition of constructions made by consuming additional FSI.\nNotably, the petitioner claimed that the project was the only instance of Development Control and Promotion Regulations (DCPR) violation they came across.\nSenior advocate Milind Sathe contended that the PIL was not filed in public interest and that the reason was to target the particular project. Moreover, he claimed that the plot in question was not a sub-divided plot but was part of a larger plot and said that the redevelopment plan was in conformity with DCPR.\nThe Court said that the petitioners' claim that the project in Worli is the only unauthorized project they know of, was false.\n\"In Mumbai city, there are several unauthorised and illegal constructions which is very widely known. Therefore, there cannot be any manner of doubt and it is obvious that this PIL has been filed for extraneous reasons and not in the public interest,\" it added.\nThus, the Court dismissed the petition with costs of ₹1 lakh to be paid to Tata Cancer Hospital, Parel."}
{"ID": "id_61", "Summary": "The Kerala High Court on Tuesday observed that merely because an accused has been held liable to be punished under Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), does not automatically mean that he must also be held guilty of having abetted the commission of suicide by the woman concerned under Section 306 IPC [Ajayakumar & Anr. v State of Kerala].\nJustice A Badharudeen noted from the judgment of the Supreme Court in Ramesh Kumar v State of Chhattisgarh, that Sections 498A and 306 of the IPC are independent and constitute different offences.\n\"Though, depending on the facts and circumstances of an individual case, subjecting a woman to cruelty may amount to an offence under Section 498A and may also, if a course of conduct amounting to cruelty is established leaving no other option for the woman except to commit suicide, amount to abetment to commit suicide. However, merely because an accused has been held liable to be punished under Section 498A, I.P.C, it does not follow that on the same evidence he must also and necessarily be held guilty of having abetted the commission of suicide by the woman concerned\", the Court said in its judgment. \nThe Court also noted that the offences of dowry death under Section 304b IPC and the offence of abetment of suicide under Section 306 IPC both involve placing a reverse burden to prove the guilt on the accused under Sections 113B and 113A of the Indian Evidence, Act. \nHowever, it observed that just because certain provisions under special acts shift the burden of proof on the accused, that doesn’t make those provisions unconstitutional.\n\"Only because the burden of proof under certain circumstances is placed on the accused, the same, by itself, would not render the impugned provisions unconstitutional,” the Court made it clear.\nIn this regard, it cited an example of a reverse burden being cast upon the accused under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 in Noor Aga v. State of Punjab and Anr. \nIt was concluded in the said judgment that the provisions of the NDPS Act which impose a reverse burden of proof are not ultra-vires the Constitution and ultimately it was held that the constitutionality of a penal provision placing burden of proof on the accused must be tested on the anvil of the State's responsibility to protect innocent citizens.\nThe High Court was considering an appeal moved by a man and his mother, who were both implicated in the suicide of a woman due to alleged harassment in relation to dowry. \nThe appellants were charged under section 304B (dowry death), 306 (abetment of suicide) read with 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).\nThe Sessions Court convicted and sentenced them, prompting the instant appeal before the High Court. \nBefore addressing the question as to whether the findings entered into by the trial court are justifiable, the Court deemed it worthwhile to discuss the essentials required to constitute the offences under sections 304B and 306 IPC.\nThe Court highlighted that when an offense under Section 304B of IPC is alleged, the same has a proximate nexus with Section 113B (presumption as to dowry death) of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.\nHowever, it observed that \"once the prosecution succeeded in establishing that the death of the lady was the outcome of cruelty or harassment by her husband or any relative of her husband soon before her death within a period of 7 years of her marriage\", only then is the burden cast on the accused \"to disprove and if he fails to rebut the presumption under Section 113B of the Evidence Act, the court is bound to act on it\"\nIn the instant, the court found that the prosecution successfully established the following fundamental constituents for attracting the provisions of Section 304B against the husband:\ndeath of a woman should have occurred otherwise than under normal circumstances;\nwithin 7 years of her marriage;\nsoon before her death she should have been subjected to cruelty or harassment by the accused; and\nin connection with any demand for dowry to presume that the accused has committed dowry death.\nHowever, it also found that the defense had not successfully disproved the husband's innocence under either 304B or 306 IPC.\nOn going through the facts of the case, the Court upheld the conviction and sentence imposed on the first appellant (victim's husband) by the trial court.\nIn the case of the mother, the court found that the prosecution had not succeeded in establishing that she had committed the offenses alleged and, therefore, acquitted her. \nThe appellants were represented by advocates Sastamangalam S Ajitkumar, Prabhu Vijaykumar and Renjith B Marar.

{"ID": "id_621", "Summary": "In a potentially controversial development, the Madras High Court Thursday took exception to the manner in which trial against TN Minister of Higher Education K Ponmudi was transferred from one district court to another based on the administrative approval granted by three High Court judges, including then Chief Justice (CJ) of the High Court.\nSingle-judge Justice N Anand Venkatesh decided to take 'suo motu revision' of the order passed by judge N Vasanthaleela, the then principal district judge at Vellore (now retired), who acquitted Ponmudi in a disproportionate wealth case in June this year. \nThe single-judge also noted that there was something \"seriously amiss\" in transfer order passed on the administrative side of the Madras High Court transferring the trial to Vasanthaleela.\nSaying that it was one of the \"most damaging cases\" he had come across, Justice Venkatesh directed the Madras High Court registry to issue notices to Ponmudi, and his wife and co-accused in the case, P Visalatchi. He also directed the registry to place the matter before the current Chief Justice SV Gangapurwala for \"further information.\"\nJustice Venkatesh said the June 28 order passed by the N Vasanthaleela, the then principal district judge, Vellore, who retired just two days after the judgement, was an instance of absolute miscarriage of justice. \nJustice Venkatesh is the portfolio judge for cases relating to MPs and MLAs. He said in his order that recently, his attention was drawn to the June 28 order based on a transfer order passed on the administrative side of the Madras High Court.\nHe said that after going through the details, he realised something was \"seriously amiss\" in the procedure adopted in the matter, including an administrative note that was issued by two of the Madras High Court administrative judges at the time, and the approval granted to that note by the then Chief Justice. \nSuch note that transferred the case against the Ponmudi couple from the district court Villupuram to the principal district judge at Vellore, despite it being subsequently approved by the CJ, was \"illegal and non-est in law.\"\nJustice Munishwar Nath Bhandari was the Chief Justice of the Madras High Court during the relevant period and the two administrative committee judges were Justices T Raja, and V Bhavani Subborayan. While CJ Bhandari and Justice Raja have since retired, Justice Subborayan is a sitting judge of the Madras High Court. \nJustice Venkatesh's order though does not name any of the concerned judges and only refers to their designations. \n\"The notice of this Court was drawn to a recent judgment that was passed by the learned Principal District Court, Vellore in Special Case No.3 of 2022 based on a transfer order passed on the administrative side of the Madras High Court. The attention of this Court was also drawn to the fact that substantial proceedings were conducted by the Principal District Court, Villupuram and that at the fag end, the case came to be transferred to the file of the Principal District Court, Vellore. This Court felt that there is something seriously amiss about the procedure adopted in transferring the case to a different Court and that too at the fag end of the trial. To top it all, the attention of the Court was also drawn to the fact that final arguments were submitted by way of written submissions on 23.06.2023 and within a span of 4 days ie., on 28.06.2023 the Principal District Judge, Vellore had managed to write a 226-page judgment acquitting the accused. The learned Principal District Judge, Vellore demitted office shortly thereafter on 30.06.2023. As a judge holding the portfolio for cases relating to MP/MLA’s I thought it fit to call for the entire records of Special Case No.3 of 2022 from the Principal District Court, Vellore. On going through the same the doubts entertained by this Court on the strange procedure followed in this case was proved right,\" Justice Venkatesh said.\nThe case against Ponmudi and his wife was registered by the DVAC in 2002 when the AIADMK returned to power in the State. The DVAC claimed that the accused persons had amassed illegal assets when Ponmudi was a minister in the DMK government between 1996 and 2001.\nWhile the trial was being presided over by court in Villupuram, it was suddenly transferred to the Vellore principal district judge on June 7 last year. The Vellore judge then acquitted the Minister and his wife saying that the prosecution had failed to furnish sufficient and legally acceptable evidence against the accused.\nIncidentally, the administrative note transferring the case had been issued on a totally unrelated request sent months ago by the principal district judge of Villupuram seeking permission to conduct hearing in the case on some non-working days. \nOnce the matter was transferred, a case that had been pending for years, was decided in the accused's favour with much alacrity, Justice Venkatesh noted.\n\"By 06.06.2023, a case which had thus far been lingering on for years started to move with great alacrity. Perhaps, the accused drew inspiration from Paulo Coelho who said that “when you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it”. By the first week of June 2023, the celestial stars of the accused appeared to be lining up perfectly, with the blessings of judicial personages, including the Principal District Judge, Vellore who was set to demit office on 30.06.2023. DW-1 was quickly examined on the side of the defense on 06.06.2023. On 23.06.2023, written submissions were made on the side of the accused, and on 28.06.2023, ie., within 4 days, the Principal District, Vellore marshalled the evidence of 172 prosecution witnesses and 381 documents and managed (or rather stage-managed) to deliver a 226-page testament/judgment acquitting all the accused.\" Justice Venkatesh said in his order. \nThis unique feat of industry on the part of the Principal District Judge, Vellore can find few parallels, and it may well be said is a feat that even judicial mortals in constitutional courts can only dream of, the High Court noted sarcastically. \n\"Two days thereafter, on June 30, 2023, the Principal District Judge, Vellore retired and cheerfully rode off into the sunset,\" the single-judge further said.\nThus he held that the transfer note was a \"calculated attempt to manipulate and subvert the criminal justice system\" and that ever since the matter was transferred to the Vellore PDJ, nothing was done in accordance with law\nIt not open to the High Court either under Section 407 of the CrPC, or under Article 227 to cherry-pick cases and arbitrarily transfer them to any court without any reason, Justice Venkatesh underlined.\nHe further stated that there was no authority either under the Constitution, the Letters Patent or any provision of law, which authorised two high court judges to exercise powers on the administrative side, \"to transfer a pending criminal case from one District to another and that too by way of a note.\"\n\"It follows that the note of the Administrative Judges dated 06.07.2022 and 07.07.2022 directing the transfer of the case from Principal District Court, Villupuram to Principal District Court, Vellore is ex-facie illegal and non-est in law,\" Justice Venkatesh said. \nThe decision by the then Chief Justice to grant approval to such transfer also came under fire from the High Curt.\nThe then Chief Justice approving such note of transfer on July 8, 2022, did not make it legal in any way since even the Chief Justice did not have any such power to randomly approve an administrative note transferring a criminal case from one court to another. \n\"The Chief Justice is the Master of the Roster vis-à-vis the Benches in the High Court. It does not follow that the Chief Justice enjoys administrative power to transfer a criminal case pending in a District Court to another District. No such power exists or has been shown to exist either by law or by convention. Consequently, the approval of the Hon’ble Chief Justice on 08.07.2022 does not clothe the note order of the Administrative judges with any legality. Consequently, the Official Communication dated 12.07.2022 directing the transfer of the case from PDJ, Villupuram to PDJ, Vellore, the transfer to the PDJ, Vellore under the orders of the PDJ, Villupuram followed by the trial and the 226-page judgment delivered thereafter on 28.06.2023 are all coram-non-judice,\" Justice Venkatesh said. \nJustice Venkatesh cited the Supreme Court's judgements in Y Balaji v Karthik Desari and several other cases to say that the High Court can suo motu exercise its powers under Article 227 of the Constitution and Sections 397 and 401 of the CrPC to interfere and set right illegalities."}

Ors.].\nThe Court reasoned that the State cannot evade its responsibility to pay the compensation merely on grounds of delay and laches. \nA division bench of Justices BP Colabawalla and Somasekhar Sundaresan pointed out that possession of the land had been taken without paying any compensation.\nAs such, denying the landowners a right to be heard merely on the ground of delay would be unjust to them, the Court opined.\n“We find that denying the petitioners an opportunity of their writ petition even being considered merely on the ground of delay would be unjust to the Petitioners. On the other hand, considering the writ petition on merits would not tilt the scale against MSEDCL and the State. The State cannot, on the ground of delay and laches, evade its responsibility towards those from whom private property has been expropriated,” the Court said.\nBy way of background, a family from Thane (Bhadani family) approached the High Court for relief after recently discovering that a plot of their land was seemingly usurped by the MSEDCL in 1984 to set up a sub-station and staff quarters without the payment of appropriate compensation.\nThe MSEDCL claimed that they had undertaken land acquisition proceedings in 1986 after taking possession of the land in 1984. The sub-station was erected in 1993, it was contended.\nThe State company argued that the compensation plea by the petitioners (the Bhadani family) was vitiated since was filed after a delay of nearly 40 years. \nThe Court, however, disagreed with MSEDCL's stance and found that the petitioners had made out a case for receiving compensation.\nHowever, the Court said that it could not direct MSEDCL to vacate the plot or hand over the same to the petitioners.\n“Multiple stakeholders have an interest in the use to which the subject land has been put, and there can be no question of granting such relief,\" the Court explained in its January 5 order.\nTherefore, the Court proceeded to order the Collector of Thane to compute the compensation payable to the petitioners under the provisions of the 2013 Land Acquisition Act and pass a compensation award within three months. \nSenior Advocate Vishwajit Sawant with advocates Vipul Makwana and Yatin R Shah appeared for Bhadani family (petitioners).\nAdvocates Deepa Chawan, Ruchi Patil, Amita Kamble briefed by Kshitija Wadatkar Associates appeared for MSEDCL.\nAdvocates Sandesh Patil and Chintan Shah appeared for Unit Arsens Developers.\nAdditional government pleader AI Patel with RS Pawar appeared for the State."}

It also said that the State should take the assistance of its cyber crime wing and recover the amounts collected through fake or illegal websites. \n\"Unfortunately, where there is go(o)d, there is also evil.

In light of this, the Court felt the need to pass a dynamic injunction, which is usually passed in matters involving intellectual property rights.\n\"Applying the same to the present case, this Court is of the view that a dynamic preventive order is necessitated because of the sheer involvement of the number of temples, touts and illegal websites that either provide links to webpages or URLs created by third parties, impersonating as that of the official temple sites,\" the Court said. \nIt, therefore, directed the State government to \"shut down\" or \"close\" all such websites within three months and submit a compliance report. \nIt also issued the following directions to the State government to ensure that such cases of impersonation are prevented in future:\ni) State government must shut down all unauthorised and fake websites opened by the third parties, in the name of the temples or, deities across the State within three months;\nii) State should take its Cyber Crime Wing's help to recover money collected through fake websites;\niii) The State government should prepare a list of authorised websites of temples in TN and provide a list of official website of temples with domain names to Department of Telecommunication and Ministry Electronics and Information Technology to ensure that any fake websites created in future are immediately blocked;\niv) Streamline the system for letting devotees perform poojas, temple rituals online.\nAdvocates R Venkatesh and M Karthikeyan appeared for the petitioners.\nAdditional Advocate General Veerakathiravan and Additional Government Pleader P Subburaj appeared for the State government. \nAdvocates VR Shunmuganathan, M Muthugeethaiyan, M Sarvanan, K Govindraj, and L Victoria Gowri appeared for the other respondents."}

Further, the interest of the Amrapali Group of Companies and consequently that of the flat buyers who had invested money in other Amrapali Projects already stands quantified at 19.75 percent. \n\"Therefore, even if there could be some similarity with regard to the status of the instant project as against “Heartbeat City” Project, considering the fact situation on record, that by itself would not afford sufficient reason to entertain the submissions on behalf of the Association and the applicants supporting the Association,\" the Court said. \nThe top court has further noted that unlike all the other projects of the Amrapali Group which were made over to the NBCC, the development with respect to the instant project has always been an on-going process. \nIn all the other projects of the Amrapali Group, either there was no development right from the inception or even if some development had been initiated, the same was completely at a standstill when the matters were taken up for consideration by this Court. \nWhile allowing La Residentia to continue with the construction of the residential flats in Noida, the Court said that 632 flats will be allowed to sold by the company at a fair price, provided all documents are counter signed by court receiver.\n\"Price of the flats will be decided on a fair basis in discussion with the court receiver. It will be open to receiver to make payments for the completion of these flats. Injunctions with regard to 632 flats shall stand modified,\" the order stated. \nJustice Lalit further stated in the order that the difference between the amount received from purchasers and the cost of construction will be credited later to the welfare of the homebuyers account of Amrapali group of companies.\nThe Court issued the following directions in today's judgment:\na) The Company shall be entitled to continue with the construction and development of the instant project; \nb) 632 flats which were subject matter of orders dated July 23, 2019 and October 14, 2019 shall be allowed to be sold by the Company to the interested persons or parties at a fair price or value, provided :- \n i) All the concerned transactions including the execution of appropriate documents or deeds are counter-signed by the Court Receiver or his nominee; \n ii) The price or value at which said flats are to be sold is certified by the Court Receiver to be fair and appropriate. \n iii) All the amounts received by way of such transactions of sale are credited to a separate account completely under the control of the Receiver and/or his nominee; \n iv) The cost of construction with respect to those 632 flats, upon due certification by the Chartered Accountants of the Company and to the satisfaction of the Receiver, shall be made over to the Company; and \n v) It shall however be open to the Receiver to give such advances towards the construction of these 632 flats from and out of the amounts deposited in the account as specified above, depending upon the stage and progress of construction. \nc) The injunction with respect said 632 flats, as directed in the orders dated July 23, 2019 and October 14, 2019, shall stand modified to the extent indicated above. \nd) The difference between the amounts received from the concerned flat buyers for purchase of said 632 flats and the expenditure incurred on cost of construction shall finally be credited to the general account maintained for the benefit of the flat buyers of the Amrapali Group of Companies\nThe Amrapali case will be heard by a fresh bench again on Mondays, at 2 pm."}
{"ID": "id_631", "Summary": "The Bombay High Court on Thursday granted bail to Mahesh Raut, one of the accused persons in the Bhima Koregaon riots case of 2018.\nA division bench of Justices AS Gadkari and Sharmila Deshmukh passed the order.\nThe Court stayed its order for a week after the National Investigation Authority (NIA) sought time to file appeal against the same before the Supreme Court. \nRaut is the sixth person to get bail in the Bhima Koregaon case after Sudha Bharadwaj, Varavara Rao, Anand Teltumbde, Vernon Gonsalves and Arun Ferreira.\nOf the above, Rao was granted bail on medical grounds. \nAnother accused Gautam Navlakha is placed under house arrest instead of being lodged in jail after a Supreme Court order to that effect. \nRaut was arrested in June 2018 and has been in custody since. He approached the High Court after a special NIA court rejected his bail plea in November 2021.\nHe claimed to be a forest rights activist and a former fellow of the prestigious Prime Minister’s Rural Development Programme and worked with the Gadchiroli Collector.\nIt was further highlighted that he had graduated from the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) in 2011 after which he did a fellowship on conflict zones.\nSenior Advocate Mihir Desai and Advocate Vijay Hiremath who appeared for Raut prayed that the Raut be granted bail on the grounds of parity with co-accused Anand Teltumbde, Arun Ferreira and Vernon Gonsalves.\nThey also argued that Raut had spent over 5 years in custody and deserved to be released since the trial was yet to begin. \nRaut’s advocates also contended that the evidence against him primarily consisted of documents recovered from the computer of co-accused Rona Wilson and not from Raut. The documents were also never allegedly signed by Raut.\nAdditional Solicitor General Devang Vyas with Advocate Sandesh Patil for the NIA opposed Raut’s bail on the ground that acts allegedly committed by Raut were against the society. \nNIA alleged that Raut recruited young students from colleges into the Communist Party of India (Maoist).\nThey argued that it was not justiciable for Raut, accused under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), to seek bail on constitutional grounds when his acts are against the interests of the State and society and the unity, integrity, security and sovereignty of India.\nThe counsel also relied upon evidence which allegedly showed that the Communist Party of India (Maoist) had given Raut ₹5 lakh along with co-accused Surendra Gadling and Sudhir Dhawale.\nThe Court observed that merely because a co-accused has claimed that he handed over money to Raut, would not make Raut a recipient of the same as there was nothing else to corroborate the claim. \nThe Court also noted that there was no evidence of any person having allegedly joined the organisation or recruited at the behest of Raut. Hence, it did not agree with NIA's contentions. \nThe court also concluded that no covert or over-terrorist act had been attributed to Raut and hence offences under the UAPA concerning terrorist acts seemed prima facie not true. \n\"After taking into consideration the totality of entire material and evidence on record against Raut, this Court is of the view that at the most it can be said that Raut is a member of the Communist Party of India (Maoist) and therefore it would attract provisions of Sections 13 and 38 of UAP Act. According to us, there is no material on record to indicate that, there are reasonable grounds for believing that the accusations against the Appellant under Sections 16, 17, 18, 20 and 39 of UAPA are prima facie true,\" the order stated while granting bail to Raut."}
{"ID": "id_632", "Summary": "The Delhi High Court has held that sexual relations established on a genuine promise of marriage that later failed to fructify due to external circumstances is not rape [Shailendra Kumar Yadav vs State]. \nJustice Subramonium Prasad said that there is a difference between a false promise of marriage and the breach of a promise to marry.\nIn the latter, the court explained, sexual relations are initiated on the premise that the two individuals will marry at a later point of time. But in the former, sexual relations take place without any intention of marrying at all and consent obtained for said relations is vitiated by way of misconception of fact.\nThe observations came from the Court as it set aside an order of the the Additional Sessions Judge (ASJ) (Central), Tis Hazari Court.\nThe ASJ had framed charges against a man for offences under Section 376(2)(n) (committing rape repeatedly on the same woman) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).\nThe petitioner (accused before the lower court) challenged the order of framing of charges, before the High Court. \nThe single-judge was told by the prosecutrix and State that the petitioner had extended a false promise of marriage on the basis of which he had sustained a physical relationship with her. The prosecutrix and the petitioner were engaged and the wedding was postponed due to issues in the former's family, it was said.\nThereafter, arguments arose about the date of marriage as well as financial condition of the prosecutrix and though she requested the petition to marry her by way of court marriage or in an Arya Samaj temple, this request was rejected.\nIt was alleged that the issues were being raised by petitioner and his family were due to the fact that the prosecutrix was not financially well-off, and that the petitioner wanted to marry a girl whose father would have the wherewithal to invest money in the marriage.\nThe petitioner argued that the couple were involved in a serious relationship but physical relations between the two had never taken place.\nIt was submitted that despite the incompatibility between the two, the petitioner was in love with the prosecutrix and intended to settle down with her therefore a roka (engagement) ceremony had taken place.\nCounsel for the petitioner said that that the instant matter is merely a case of a relationship that has ended on bad terms and the lower court had failed to apply its judicial mind to the facts of the case, and mechanically framed charges.\nJustice Prasad observed that to arrive at the conclusion that sexual relations between the petitioner and prosecutrix were coerced, it is necessary to examine whether, at the stage of rendering a promise to marry, it was done with the intention of not keeping the promise and therefore, was false at the inception.\nHe said if it is found that the promise of marriage was genuine and that the marriage failed to fructify due to external circumstances, then the promise cannot be said to be false, and consent as per Section 90 of the IPC is not vitiated.\nThe Court said that as per Section 90, consent given under fear or misconception cannot be said to be consent and in this context, it becomes relevant to factor in the aspect that the prosecutrix and the petitioner were in a long-term relationship.\nAfter perusing the first information report (FIR) and the status report, the judge held that not only were they (prosecutrix and petitioner) in a long-term relationship but even a roka had taken place that was attended by all family members, indicating that the petitioner did indeed intend to marry the prosecutrix.\n“Just because the relationship ended on hostile terms, it cannot be said there was no intention of the Petitioner to marry the prosecutrix in the first place. Flowing from this, this Court is of the opinion that the consent so accorded by the prosecutrix for the establishment of a physical relationship was not predicated upon misconception or fear,\" the Court said. \nJustice Prasad added that the lower court had failed to accord any reasons to substantiate as to how there was sufficient material to proceed against the petitioner under Section 376(2)(n) IPC.\nHe said that the order has merely recorded the submission of the Additional Public Prosecutor (APP) that there is sufficient material on record to prosecute the petition under Section 376(2)(n) and proceeded at the behest of the prosecutor, without providing any reasons to justify its stand.\n“As has been stated above, the trial court is not a mere post office and must apply its mind to the facts of the case to arrive at the conclusion as to whether a prima facie case is made out against the accused that would warrant charges to be framed against them. The order dated March 8, 2021 has evidently failed to perform its duty and has rendered a mechanical order on charge without sifting or weighing the evidence before it,” the Court stated. \nThe lower court's order is replete with legal infirmities and deserves to be set aside, the High Court ruled.\nThe petitioner in the case was represented by advocate Badar Mahmood. Additional Public Prosecutor Neelam Sharma appeared for the State."}

Faiyyaz Mansuri who was booked under National Security Act, 1980 for an alleged Facebook post on Babri Masjid (Mohd. Faiyyaz Mansuri v. Union of India).\nA Division Bench comprising Justices Ramesh Sinha and Saroj Yadav opined that Mansuri's detention under NSA was justified but the delay by the government in disposing of his representation was not, and quashed the detention order on that ground.\n\"There was delay in disposal of the representation of the petitioner by the Central Government and having regard to the nature of detention and rigor of law, we are of the view that there was disproportionate delay at the end of the Central Government. For the reasons aforesaid, we are of the view that the plea of the detenue/petitioner that there is delay in forwarding the petitioner’s representation on the part of the respondent no.1 (Union of India), has substance and on this count alone, the impugned detention order is liable to be quashed,\" the Court ordered.\nIn its order passed on a Habeas Corpus plea, the Court emphasized that the Indian Constitution guarantees various freedoms and personal liberty to all persons, but the same should not be 'misused'. \n\"However, it should be kept in mind by one and all that the constitutional guarantee of such freedoms and liberty is not meant to be abused and misused so as to endanger and threaten the very foundation of the pattern of our free society in which the guaranteed democratic freedom and personal liberty is designed to grow and flourish,\" the order said.\nPosting provocative message through his Facebook wall strikes at the root of the State’s authority and is directly connected to ‘public order’, the court said.\nThe detenue had allegedly put up the following post on Facebook: \n\"Babri maszid ek din dubara banai Jayegi, jis tarah Turki ki Sofiya maszid banai gai thi.\" \nOn August 5, 2020 a written report was filed by one Sagar Kapoor, that the detenue/petitioner had posted provocative post with the intention of provoking the sentiments of Hindu society through his Facebook. One Samreen Bano made indecent comment to that post and was supported by some other persons, it was alleged.\nOn the basis of the said written report, a case was registered under Sections 153A, 292, 505 (2), 506, 509 of Indian Penal Code and Section 67 of Information Technology Act, 2008. During the investigation, Section 292 and 509 were dropped and Section 295A was added.\nLater, the applicant was sent to jail and subsequently he was booked under National Security Act and detained. \nThe counsel for applicant/accused submitted that police had filed the charge-sheet against the detenue without verifying the facts or evidence as mandated under Section 65-B of the Indian Evidence Act to connect a person with an information technology crime. \nHe also argued that in the FIR, four persons were named as accused and the main person, Samreen Bano, who allegedly made abusive comments, has not been arrested till date.\nIt was also argued that delay and latches by the government in considering the petitioner’s representation has infringed fundamental rights of the detenue enshrined under Articles 21 and 22 (5) of the Constitution of India. \nOn the other hand, Additional Government Advocate (AGA) argued that the Act/offence committed by the detenue/petitioner violated the rights of other religion and is in the nature of insulting the religious sentiments of one community. \nThe calculated tendency of this aggravated form of insult is clearly to disrupt public order, it was submitted. It was in the nature of insulting religion with deliberate and malicious intention of outraging the religious feelings of one class, submitted the AGA.\nThe Court held that the grounds on which petitioner was 'detained' by the authorities were justified.\n\"This Court, therefore, has no hesitation in holding that the instance of petitioner's activities enumerated in the grounds of detention, clearly show that his activities cover a wide field and fall within the contours of the concept of 'public order' Hence, there is no substance on the plea of the petitioner in this regard.\"\nHowever, on the issue of deciding petitioner's representation, the Court took into account the argument of the petitioner and held government's affidavit did not contain a day-to-day explanation while dealing with the petitioner's representation between October 25, 2020 to November 11, 2020.\n\"Having regard to the nature of detention and rigor of law, we are of the view that there was a disproportionate delay at the end of the Central Government.\"\nThe Habeas Corpus plea was, therefore, allowed and the detention order under NSA was quashed."}

Considering her age, and at the time of accident, she was wife of deceased, is sufficient ground that she is entitled for the compensation. Moreover after death of husband remarriage can not be a taboo to get a compensation,\" the Court held in the order passed on March 3.\nThe bench was seized of a plea filed by the Iffco Tokio General Insurance Company challenging the order of a Motor Accidents Claim Tribunal (MACT) by which the firm was held liable to compensate the respondent wife of one Ganesh, who died in an accident in May 2010. \nAs per the facts of the case, the woman's husband Ganesh, was travelling on a motor cycle as a pillion rider when the two wheeler hit an auto rickshaw which was being drive in a rash and negligent manner. He died while he was being treated. \nAt the time of death of her husband, the claimant-wife was 19 years old. Thereafter, she filed a claim petition for compensation.\nDuring pendency of the petition she re-married.\nThe insurance company highlighted this as a ground to deny compensation.\nIt also contended that it can't be held liable to pay the compensation as the autorickshaw was only permitted to ply within Thane district. \nHowever, Justice Dige rejected both the arguments.\n\"In my view the company have not examined any witness to prove that taking offending rickshaw outside the jurisdiction of Thane district was breach of terms of permit, and it amount’s to breach of terms and conditions of insurance policy.

{"ID": "id_639", "Summary": "The Allahabad High Court on Wednesday rejected a public interest litigation (PIL) petition seeking the recognition of Mathura's Shahi Idgah Mosque site as Krishna Janmabhoomi (birthplace of Krishna) and which had also sought the removal of the mosque from the disputed land.\nA bench of Chief Justice Pritinker Diwaker and Justice Ashutosh Srivastava passed the order today after it was reserved for judgment in September.\nThe Court dismissed the PIL after noting that the reliefs sought were already pending consideration before the High Court in related suits. \n\"Since the issues involved in the present writ (PIL) is already engaging attention of the Court in appropriate proceedings (i.e. the pending suits), we are not inclined to entertain the instant writ (PIL) and the same is accordingly dismissed,\" the Court's order stated. \nThe PIL plea was filed by advocate Mahek Maheshwari in 2020, who argued that numerous historical texts have documented that the site in question was in fact Krishna Janmabhoomi. \nFurthermore, the plea asserted that the historical roots of Mathura could be traced back to the time of the Ramayana, while Islam arrived much later, approximately 1,500 years ago.\nThe plea added that Shahi Idgah does not qualify as a legitimate mosque under Islamic jurisprudence since a mosque cannot be constructed on land acquired through force. On the other hand, according to Hindu jurisprudence, a temple retains its sacred status even if it lies in ruins, the petitioner said. \nAs such, the petitioner had urged the Court to order the transfer of the land to the Hindu community. Further, the petitioner prayed for the establishment of a legitimate trust for the Krishna Janmabhoomi Janmasthan, which would be dedicated to constructing a temple on the same land.\nAdditionally, the plea prayed for a court-monitored excavation using GPRS technology by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) at the disputed site, which is believed to have been constructed over Krishna Janmasthan.\nA civil suit is already pending before a trial court seeking similar reliefs. \nEarlier this year, a trial court in Uttar Pradesh, the Allahabad High Court and the Supreme Court had rejected the Hindu Trust's plea for a scientific survey of the disputed site."}

The words 'family members of victim' are to be substituted in place of the recitals to be deleted.\nThe High Court observed on Monday that the scope of proceedings before the High Court was two-fold:\nFirstly, monitoring of the CBI investigation into the alleged crime, and \nSecondly, the issue of illegal cremation of the deceased victim and all matters connected.\nTherefore, the Court disposed of the impleadment application by the accused with an observation that accused/applicants would have a right of hearing if at all any of their rights are adversely affected or likely to be adversely affected in the proceedings before the Court.\nResponding to an application seeking to restrain the media in their coverage of the case, the Court said that it expected the media to be guided by the pronouncements of the Supreme Court as in the case of Siddharth Vashisht @ Monu Sharma Vs.

The State refuted this contention and stated that there was no such move at all.\nThe erstwhile Superintendent of Police, Hathras, Vikrant Veer appeared before the High Court and made a statement that it was he and the District Magistrate who had taken the decision to cremate the victim's body in the night.\nNotably, during the course of arguments, the Court asked Senior Advocate SV Raju (appearing for the State), whether it was fair and reasonable to allow the District Magistrate to continue at Hathras during pendency of the investigation. \nOn this aspect, the Court pointed out that the Magistrate was involved in the thick of things. Therefore, the Bench questioned if it would be appropriate to shift him elsewhere during pendency of the proceedings, without there being any stigma attached to such an action and only to ensure fairness and transparency in the matter.\nRaju undertook to convey the issue to the State Government and come back to the Court with a response by the next date of hearing.\nThe affidavits filed on behalf of the District Magistrate, Hathras, the then Superintendent of Police and the State Government were also taken on record.\nThe matter will now be heard on November 25 at 3.15 pm.\nLast month, the Allahabad High Court took suo motu cognizance over the pre-dawn cremation of the 19-year old dalit woman who was stated to have been gang-raped and mutilated.\nThe victim succumbed to her injuries at Delhi's Safdarjung Hospital yesterday.

These funds, amounting to crores of rupees, were received by Newsclick through illegal means over a span of five years.\nThe funds were fraudulently infused by Neville Roy Singham, allegedly an active member of the Communist Party of China's propaganda department, through a complex network of entities, it was alleged.\nThey then moved the High Court challenging their arrest, remand and the FIR lodged against them in a case under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA).\nBefore the High Court, they argued that their arrest and remand were illegal since they were not supplied with grounds of arrest and the same was in violation of the recent Supreme Court judgment in Directorate of Enforcement vs Roop Bansal and Ors (M3M case).\nThey also claimed that not a penny was received from China as alleged by the Delhi Police.\nThe Delhi Police on the other hand claimed that the accused wanted to compromise national security and integrity.\nThey also said that the judgment in M3M case would not apply in the instant case since the same was delivered on the same day the arrest happened, i.e. October 3 and the Delhi Police were not aware about it.\nRead more about the arguments made by parties here.\nSenior Advocates Kapil Sibal, Dayan Krishnan and Siddharth Aggarwal along with Advocates Arshdeep Singh Khurana, Harsh Srivastava, Harshit Mahalwal, Sidak Singh Anand, Manan Khanna, Nikhil Pawar, Rupali Samuel, Sowjhanya Shankar, Shreedhar Kale, Chaitanya and Vibhu Walia appeared for Purkayastha.\nAdvocates Rohit Sharma, Rounak Nayak, Nikhil Purohit and Jatin Lalwani represented Amit Chakraborty.\nDelhi Police was represented through Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, Additional Standing Counsel Amol Sinha as well as Advocates Akhand Pratap Singh, Kshitiz Garg, Ashvini Kumar, Rahul Kochar, Chavi Lazarus, Zoheb Hossain, Vivek Gurnani, Baibhav and Manisha Dubey."}
{"ID": "id_650", "Summary": "The Karnataka High Court has recently pulled up the Koramangala Police for their shoddy investigation in a case where a man stood accused of sexually harassing and molesting his four-year-old minor daughter.\nIn an order passed last month, Justice M Nagaprasanna allowed a petition filed by the victim child's mother (wife of the accused) to direct further investigation in the case.\nUpon examination of the chargesheet by the High Court, it became evident that the investigation exhibited nine significant deficiencies.\nThe loopholes noted by the High Court included the failure of the police to record statements made by the victim incriminating the accused, the failure to seize mobile devices and laptops which were stated to have incriminating videos and photos, the omission of a report by a psychologist who examined the child and the failure to take statements from relatives. \n\"All the nine rungs which are in the considered view of the Court vital piece of evidence have been deliberately let off by the Investigating Officer. If this would not form the ingredients of a shoddy investigation, I fail to understand as to what would,\" Justice Nagaprasanna remarked. \nThe judge also opined that the investigation appeared to have been conducted by the police \"in a mortal hurry\" solely to meet the deadline for filing the chargesheet.\nThe Court further noted that despite the serious nature of the offenses alleged, the police did not request a custodial interrogation of the husband. \n\"On the bedrock of the principles laid down by the Apex Court ... and the lacunae that is projected by the petitioner and accepted in the course of the order, it would lead to an unmistakable conclusion that the case at hand requires further investigation,\" the High Court concluded. \nJustice Nagaprasanna proceeded to direct that the probe should be handed over to a different investigating officer since the earlier investigating officer appeared to have been partial to the accused.\nThe investigating officer so tasked with conducting the investigation further should conclude it within three months after being entrusted with the probe, the Court said. \n\"While further investigating, the Investigating Officer shall bear in mind the observations made in the course of the order,\" the Court added.\nThe wife (petitioner) of the accused had moved the High Court for relief after a sessions court dismissed her plea for further investigation last January.\nA complaint had been filed against her husband alleging that he was sexually perverted, addicted to watching pornography, and had been sexually harassing and molesting his four-year-old daughter.\nThe accused was stated to have persistently pressured his wife as well to have sexual relations in the presence of the minor child. The petitioner claimed that the accused would physically assault and verbally abuse her if she resisted such demands. \nShe proceeded to file a complaint under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (POCSO Act) in August last year. \nHer husband was arrested in the following month, but released on bail weeks later after a chargesheet was filed and after the police did not insist on keeping him in their custody. \nSince the High Court has now ordered a further investigation to be conducted in the matter, the trial court was asked not to proceed further with the case until the further investigation report is filed. \nSenior Advocate Sandesh J Chouta and advocate Sampreeth V represented the petitioner.

{"ID": "id_651", "Summary": "The Bombay High Court on Saturday dismissed the plea filed by businessman Raj Kundra assailing his remand to custody and subsequent orders of the Metropolitan Magistrate in the porn film racket case.\nJustice AS Gadkari held that the remand order of July 19, 2021 passed by the Magistrate and all orders of subsequent remand in the matter of the custody, were in conformity with law. \n\"The arrest by the investigating officer and remand to police custody by Magistrate is within the conformity of the provisions of law. The impugned order does not suffer from any error, which requires this Court to interfere with it under its jurisdiction under Article 227 of the Constitution of India\" the Court ordered. \nKundra was booked under Sections 292, 293 (sale of obscene material) under the Indian Penal Code, Sections 67, 67A (transmission of sexually explicit material) under the Information Technology Act and provisions of the Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Act.\nHe was arrested by the Mumbai Police on Monday and produced before the Metropolitan Magistrate at Esplanade, who remanded him to police custody till July 23, 2021,which was extended till July 27.\nOn Tuesday, the Magistrate remanded Kundra to judicial custody for 14 days.\nHis bail application was rejected on July 28, 2021 by the Magistrate Court.\nKundra's contentions challenging his custody were:\nThat the maximum punishment attracted by the offences alleged against him is upto 7 years;\nThat the notice by the police under Section 41A of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) was given despite admittedly having no intention to arrest Kundra;\nThat it was completely illegal to arrest him without complying with the requirement of law and the guidelines in the Arnesh Kumar judgment and In Re: Contagion.\nSenior Advocate Aabad Ponda, appearing for Kundra, had submitted that the reason claimed for adding Section 201 (causing evidence to disappear) of Indian Penal Code as a charge against his client was an afterthought to meet the requirements to tackle this petition.\nHe argued that the contentions of the Mumbai Police seeking his custody and extension of custody changed with each remand, and were not consistent.\nFurther, there was nothing on record to show that the evidence had been deleted when there was a panchnama made, Ponda added.\nHe argued that such an submissions was not made in the arrest, or first and subsequent remands, or charge during remand, or ground for further custody.\nChief Public Prosecutor Aruna Pai, appearing for the Mumbai Police, opposed the plea, stating that Kundra had been arrested only because he had refused to acknowledge the notice under Section 41A CrPC, which implied that there was no intention to co-operate from his end.\nShe added that Kundra was arrested because he was trying to destroy or had already destroyed some of the evidence that the agency was trying to recover.\nShe also argued that the investigating agency could not have stood there as “mute spectators” while evidence was being destroyed, as that would have ruined the purpose of investigation.\nShe concluded by pointing out that the evidence collected against Kundra had been considered by the Magistrate before he passed his orders remanding Kundra to custody.\nIn his plea before the High Court, Kundra also sought for interim bail pending the hearing of the petition, which was not granted by the Court.\nAfter hearing both sides at length, Justice AS Gadkari reserved the case for orders.\nKundra has also approached the Mumbai Sessions Court seeking bail after the Magistrate Court rejected his bail plea. \nThe Sessions Court has issued notice and will hear his plea on August 10, 2021."}
{"ID": "id_655", "Summary": "The Orissa High Court recently observed that the law holding that sex on a false promise of marriage amounts to rape, appears to be erroneous and that the matter deserves a serious relook [Santosh Kumar Nayak v. State].\nJustice SK Panigrahi raised concerns over the rationality of extending Section 90 (dealing with consent under fear or misconception) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) to Section 375, IPC (dealing with rape) to determine the validity of consent for sex given on a false promise of marriage.\n\" ... the automatic extension of provisions of Section 90 of IPC to determine the effect of a consent under Section 375 of IPC. deserves a serious relook. The law holding that false promise to marriage amounts to rape appears to be erroneous,\" the Court observed.\nThe Court made the comment after noting that there is a distinction between promises of marriage that are false from the very beginning and the cases where such promises may be genuine to begin with, but later not fulfilled. \nFurther, the Court also observed that there may be instances where the existing rape law is misused, thereby defeating its purpose. \n\"In fact, such cases are on rise, where both the persons, out of their own sweet will and choice, develop consensual physical relationship but when the relationship gets sour for some reasons, the women use the law as a lethal weapon for vengeance and personal vendetta. They, out of anger or frustration, tend to convert such consensual acts as incidents of rape. This misuse defeats the very purpose of the provision of law,\" the Court said.\nThe Court went on to express concern over whether the present law is sufficient to tackle varying concerns that arise in rape cases involving allegations of false promises to marry. Rape law often fails to capture the plight of victims from disadvantageous groups who are lured by false promises of marriage, the judge added. \n\"The rape laws should not be used to regulate intimate relationships, especially in cases where women have agency and are entering a relationship by choice. It is also equally disturbing, many of the complaints come from socially disadvantaged and poor segment of the society, rural areas, who are often lured into sex by men on false promises of marriage. The rape law often fails to capture their plight\", stated the order. \nThe Court also highlighted that a false promise of marriage is not one of the express grounds laid down by the lawmakers under Section 375, IPC for determining whether consent for sexual intercourse was valid or not.\n“Since the framers of law have specifically provided the circumstances when 'consent' amounts to 'no consent in terms of Section 375 of IPC, hence consent for the sexual act on the pretext of marriage is not one of the circumstances mentioned under Section 375 of IPC,\" the Court said. \nThe Court made the observations while allowing a plea for bail in a case involving allegations of rape on a false promise to marry. \nThe petitioner was alleged to have eloped with the victim after he made a promise to marry her. He was accused of having maintained a physical relationship with the victim for several days before abandoning her. After a first information report (FIR) was registered in the matter, the petitioner was arrested, prompting him to move the Court for grant of bail.\nThe petitioner's counsel highlighted that the victim, in the present case, was a major and that she had accompanied the petitioner willingly. It was further argued that the medical examination report indicated that there was no forceful sexual assault. \nThe State counsel argued that the petitioner had repeatedly committed sexual intercourse on the victim with an assurance of marriage. Further, it was submitted that the petitioner had clicked private photos of the victim before he abandoned her. \nThe Court noted that the medical report, prima facie, suggested that there was no forcible sexual intercourse. Further, the allegations that the petitioner had taken private photos of the victim appeared cloudy without a proper trial, the Judge observed. \nThe Court proceeded to opine that the benefit of bail ought to be given to the petitioner until that matter is decided by the trial court. \n“Truthfulness or falsity of the allegations, essentially pertains to the realm of evidence and the same cannot be pre-judged at this initial stage which warrants a trial to establish ... As the facts unfold, the victim being a major girl with sound mind, there seems to be no question of anyone being in a position to induce her into a physical relationship under an assurance of marriage,\" the Court observed.\nBail was granted subject to the condition that the petitioner cooperates with the investigation and that he would not threaten the victim or misuse his liberty. \nThe Court also clarified that the observations made in the bail order regarding the facts of the case should not come in the way or prejudicially affect the fair trial of the case.\nAdvocate Debasnan Das represented petitioner while Additional Government Advocate D Mund appeared for victim."}

[Aditya Kumar v. The State of Bihar & Anr]\nThe Supreme Court was told that two judicial officers were also allegedly involved in helping the police officer in an attempt at forum shopping.\nThe Bench of Justices Aniruddha Bose, Ahsanuddin Amanullah and Augustine George Masih opined that this larger issue cannot be left unattended, while dismissing an anticipatory bail plea by Aditya Kumar, the Indian Police Service (IPS) officer in question.\n“This Court will certainly not shut its eyes to the materials unearthed, since it relates not only to maintaining purity in judicial proceedings, but upholding public faith in the system at large. We are of the firm view that further directions are necessitated,” the order stated.\nEarlier, the Patna High Court, while dismissing Kumar’s plea for pre-arrest bail, had referred the matter against the two judicial officers to the Chief Justice. The top court has now directed the Patna High Court to apprise it about the action taken against the two judicial officers in question.\n“The Registrar General, Patna High Court is directed to submit, in a sealed cover, complete details of what action the High Court has taken, along with copies of relevant documents, pursuant to the reference made to ‘Hon’ble the Chief Justice for taking appropriate decision on the administrative side' apropos all such facts which have been noted in the Impugned Judgment,\" the Supreme Court order said.\nThe apex court further ordered the Economic Office Unit (EOW) of the Bihar Police to make available the entire case diary of the related criminal case in a sealed cover on the next date of hearing, December 12.\nKumar, the Superintendent of Police-rank officer who filed the bail plea, is alleged to conceived a plan with co-accused Abhishek Agrawal @ Abhishek Bholpalaka to dupe the then Director General of Police (DGP) in Bihar by creating a fake WhatsApp account using the profile picture of then Chief Justice Sanjay Karol, who is now a Supreme Court judge. \nIt was allegedly found that the co-accused used to make phone calls to the DGP in the name of the High Court Chief Justice to get a pending case against Kumar dropped. The investigation revealed that the accused were successful in making the DGP believe that he was the High Court Chief Justice.\nWhile dismissing Kumar’s anticipatory bail plea in March this year, the High Court had perused the case diary and found the involvement of two judicial officers with the accused persons. \nThey had allegedly tried to get Kumar’s case listed before a particular bench of the High Court, it was noted.\nAfter Kumar challenged the denial of pre-arrest bail, the top court initially granted him interim protection from arrest by an order passed in May this year.\nHis counsel argued that investigation has been completed and whatever allegations there are against him are based on statements made by the co-accused. \nIt was also submitted that at most, there may be some justification in charging Kumar under the Information Technology Act, but the provisions of Indian Penal Code do not apply. Ultimately, no benefit had accrued to Kumar, the Court was told.\nHowever, the EOW argued that Kumar was not a mere co-accused, but the main beneficiary of the crime, and that cogent evidence had emerged to physically link him with the co-accused.\nThe investigating agency also said that there were chats between the two judicial officers, who were in touch with the co-accused with regard to getting matters listed before a particular bench of the Patna High Court.\nConsidering the allegations, the Supreme Court ultimately rejected Kumar’s anticipatory bail plea and asked him to surrender within two weeks.\n“This Court is of the opinion that the petitioner is not entitled to the benefit of anticipatory bail, majorly on account of the seriousness and gravity of the alleged offences and apparent non-cooperation,” the order said.\nSenior Advocates Siddhartha Dave and SD Sanjay, along with Advocate Ashish Batra represented the petitioner.\nAdvocates Saket Singh, Sangeeta Singh and Niranjana Singh represented the State."}
{"ID": "id_66", "Summary": "The Calcutta High Court on Tuesday stayed the decision of the Union Home Ministry to deactivate the Aadhaar cards of a woman and her family members accused of being Bangladeshi nationals [Priya Das vs Union of India].\nSingle-judge Justice Sabyasachi Bhattacharyya noted that the authorities did not follow the procedure as mandated under the Citizenship Act, 1955 for stripping an individual of Indian citizenship and also the procedures envisaged under the rules governing Aadhaar.\n\"Before such adjudication and/or a formal enquiry being undertaken, the respondent authorities cannot, in any manner, take away the basic rights of the petitioner woman and her family as citizens of India, as in the present case,\" the Court said.\nThe Court noted that the woman's husband had initiated criminal proceedings against her alleging that she was a Bangladeshi national.\nHowever, the judge noted that at the time of enrolling for Aadhaar, the woman had submitted several documents indicating that she was an Indian citizen.\n\"Even if we assume for the sake of argument that the petitioner’s husband, against whom she has initiated a matrimonial suit and an alimony application, furnished certain documents, which are purportedly documents of her Bangladeshi nationality, there is no reason as to why ipso facto such documents, without further scrutiny, field enquiry and justified reasoning, would vitiate the documents produced by her regarding her Indian Citizenship,\" the Court said in the order.\nThe presumption might have been otherwise if such documents regarding Bangladeshi citizenship were discovered or recovered from the custody of the petitioners themselves, the Court added.\nIt further said that it is for the petitioner's husband to prove beyond all reasonable doubt that she and her family are Bangladeshi citizens and were so at the juncture when the documents-in-question including the Aadhaar Cards etc. were issued in their favour.\nThe Court was hearing a plea filed by a woman and her family members whose Aadhaar cards were deactivated by the MHA on information received from Central Security Agency (CSA) stating that the petitioner was a Bangladeshi citizen. \nThe Union government argued that since dual citizenship is impermissible under Indian Constitution, the Aadhaar cards were deactivated and consequentially her PAN and Voter ID cards were also suspended.\nFrom the criminal proceedings initiated by the husband against the petitioner, the Court noted that even the sub-inspector of police investigating the case was unsure as to whether the petitioners were Bangladeshi nationals. \n\"The relevant extract of the said report indicates that the accused persons, that is, the petitioners, who are a family, are holding a number of documents pertaining to identity proof of the said persons with regard to their Indian citizenship as specifically showed at this present juncture. It is very difficult to prove, found the police in their report, that the petitioners are Bangladeshi nationals,\" the Court noted.\nIt said that since the authorities failed to follow the due procedure, a strong prima facie case was made out by the petitioners to challenge the memoranda deactivating the Aadhaar. \n\"Insofar as the deactivation of the Aadhaar Cards during pendency of the writ petition is concerned, the same also prima facie appears to be de hors the procedure as laid down in the 2016 Regulations pertaining to Aadhaar Cards.

{"ID": "id_660", "Summary": "The Aurangabad Bench of Bombay High Court has held that candidates who are elected unopposed in local body elections, are also required to furnish accounts of election expenses incurred by them. \nThe judgment was rendered by a Bench of Justices SV Gangapurwala and Sunil P Deshmukh. \nThe Court observed that the recent trend among candidates is to publicise their candidature with much fanfare.\nEven while submitting their nomination forms, candidates opt for processions with bands, putting cut- outs, advertisements, etc which involve substantial expenditure, the Court said.\nHence, expenses are incurred by such a candidate even if there is no other candidate contesting election against the concerned person. \n\"It, thus, cannot be said in all the cases there would be no election expenses in contest free or unopposed elections and candidates getting elected unopposed, would stand exempted from tendering election expenses,\" the court held. \nThe matter was initially heard by a single-judge which noted a judgment passed by Bombay High Court in the case of Dipmala w/o Ravindra Chachane V/s. Additional Commissioner, Nagpur. \nThe single-judge noted that the Dipmala judgment gave an indication that for a particular post only if there are two or more candidates, it would amount to a contest and candidates incurring expenditure in such a contest are only obliged to tender their accounts.\nThe single judge also adverted to two orders passed by the State Election Commission (EC) - one, an order dated February 7, 1995 where a candidate was supposed to maintain an abstract of accounts of expenditure; and two, an order dated October 15, 2016 with regard to submission of expenses in election to the Parliament, Legislative assembly and local bodies.\nThe single-judge noted that the two orders of the Election Commission were not brought to the notice of the Bombay High Court in Dipmala. \nHence, the single judge referred the question to a larger bench after framing the following question to be considered by the larger Bench. \n“Whether a candidate elected unopposed, is required to tender his accounts of election expenditure under Section 14B (1) of the Maharashtra Village Panchayat Act, Section 16 (1- D) of the Maharashtra Municipalities Nagar Panchayats and Townships Act 1965 and section 15B (1) under the Maharashtra Zilla Parishad and Panchayat Samities Act, 1961, in view of the order dated 07.02.1995 and the Government Resolution dated 15.10.2016? ”\nAdvocate Jiwan J Patil appearing for the petitioners submitted that in order to prevent and deter candidates from misusing money, the provisions of the Village Panchayat Acts were introduced. \nHe, however, argued that non-furnishing of accounts within time, would not in all cases entail disqualification, as the vested discretion by the election authority ought to be exercised to maintain the election of the person who has been democratically elected. \nIn many a case, the candidate goes elected without any contest eliminating expenses required over election contest. \nIn such cases, Patil argued, \"non submissions of accounts while there are no election expenses worth the name, non compliance of procedure, may have to be appropriately construed without disturbing election of a person who has been democratically elected\".\nInterpreting the provisions under Maharashtra Village Panchayat Act, the Division Bench stated that the regulations were introduced to bring purity in elections and check the financial affairs and transactions of the candidates. \n\"Money, its power and infuence have strong propensity to subserve the cause of privileged class putting them in distinctly advantageous position,\" the bench observed.\nThe Court opined that the provisions emerged due to the \"unethical, unlawful and corrupt use of money to infuence, entice, induce people rather corrupting their conscience and/or may be a case to take disadvantage of poor condition of people forcing them to surrender their conscience and obtain votes\".\nThe regulatory provisions keep the candidates in check and restrict their unbridled tendencies, desires and ambitions and warns them not to drift to unethical means to have themselves elected, the Court further said. \nThe Division Bench also noted that in the Dipmala's case, neither of the State EC's order were referred to or brought to the notice of the Court. \nThe verdict came on the specific facts of the case, and no other judgment had laid down such a ratio that in all cases of unopposed elections, accounts need not be furnished, the Court noted.\n\"It, thus, cannot be said in all the cases that, there would be no election expenses in contest free or unopposed elections and candidates getting elected unopposed, would stand exempted from tendering election expenses,\" the Court ruled."}

Joint Seat Allocation Authority)\nSingle judge Justice Dinesh Kumar Singh volunteered to contribute the fee and handed over the money to the petitioner girl after court hours.\n\"Considering the facts of the present case, where a young bright dalit girl student has come before this Court seeking equity jurisdiction to enable to pursue her dream of getting admitted in the I.I.T., this Court on its own has volunteered to contribute Rs.15,000 the fee for allocation of the seat. The said amount has been handed over to the petitioner after court hours today itself,\" the Court noted in its order.\nThe Court also directed the University to create a supernumerary seat for the petitioner, if there is no seat vacant and asked the petitioner to report to the campus within three days, along with the necessary documents for admission.\n\"If there is no seat vacant in the said discipline, IIT BHU is directed to create a supernumerary post, which shall be subject to the admission of the petitioner being regularized in the event of any seat falling vacant in future as a result of exigency which may arise in the course of admission process,\" the order said. \nThe petitioner Sanskriti Ranjan had secured 95.6 percent marks in 10th and 94 percent marks in 12th.

Thereafter, the petitioner had applied for JEE Advanced and cleared the same with 1,469 rank in Scheduled Caste category.\nThe counsel for petitioner informed the Court that Ranjan was not able to pay the amount of ₹15,000 for seat acceptance as her father has been diagnosed with chronic kidney decease and was advised to undergo kidney transplant.\nIt was further submitted that petitioner and her father had written to Joint Seat Allocation Authority many times seeking extension of time for payment of fees but received no reply.\nReliance was also placed on the recent case of Prince Jaibir Singh before the Supreme Court in which the top court had come to the rescue of a 17-year-old Dalit student who had qualified for Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Bombay but missed out on a seat because of failure to remit seat acceptance fees on time due to technical glitches. \nThe apex court in that case had exercised its powers under Article 142 of the Constitution, to direct the creation of a seat in IIT for the boy after it was pointed out that student was unable to pay fees on time due to technical faults on the part of the bank for which he was not responsible.\nThe apex court had also said that the authorities should not take such a wooden approach in such cases but should understand the ground realities.\n\"Don’t take this wooden approach.

{"ID": "id_669", "Summary": "The Karnataka High Court recently rejected a petition challenging certain restrictions imposed by the Central government on import of polyethylene in India [All India HDPE/PP Woven Fabric Manufacturers Association v. The Secretary Government of India & Others].\nJustice M Nagaprasanna said the notification passed by the government only seeks to achieve a seal of the Bureau of Indian Standard (BIS) seal on every raw material (polyethylene) brought in to manufacture the final product (plastic).\nThe Court would be “loathe to” interfere with such a policy decision of the government, particularly of economic and quality standards, the single-judge said.\nThe BIS is a national standards body which permits the development, standardisation and quality certification of goods and the certification will be through BIS standard mark, it explained.\n“This Court does [not] sit over the decision of Government of India, to assess the quality and direct that such steps should not be taken,” Justice Nagaprasanna reasoned.\nThe Court was hearing a petition filed by All India HDPE/PP Woven Fabric Manufacturers Association, a union of manufacturers and suppliers of high density polyethylene, low density polyethylene and other allied products.\nThe petitioner had challenged the Central government’s 2021 notification stating that polyethylene should conform to the Indian standards.\nIt was argued that imposition of such a clause will restrict free movement of raw material. In particular, it was alleged that the move was aimed to help Reliance Industries which manufactures linear low density polyethylene.\nConsidering the submissions, the Court called the Association’s argument “preposterous” that the decision taken by the Centre has no nexus with the production of plastic.\nIt reasoned that if the raw material lacks the quality, the finished product also would be below par.\n“Therefore, the said submission is sans countenance, as it is fundamentally flawed,” the Court said.\nThe Court also rejected the argument that the notification would lead to monopolisation by the dominant manufacturer Reliance and called it “farther from truth”. \n“Though this Court would not consider the said submission unless there is adequate evidence of such cartelization, which is not placed before the Court by the petitioner, the learned Deputy Solicitor General of India has placed a chart of 50 manufacturers in the same industry, which includes manufacturers in India and abroad and 12 manufacturers of raw material. Reliance, is not the only but, five among the 12,” it said.\nThe Court also dismissed the reliance placed on a communication of the Plastics Export Promotion Council which had said the decision of imposition of BIS standard on import of polymers would have serious ramifications.\nIt is not an opinion of the Government of India but a narration of two factors - the grievance projected by the association and the opinion of the council, the Court opined.\nThe Court further observed that it cannot assume the role of a supreme adviser to the administration on policies. \nThe Court concluded that every raw material now that is sought to be brought under BIS is only to make it a quality final plastic product that would not become hazardous to the environment.\nIf the product under the programme “Make in India” is sought to be exported under the tag “Made in India”, quality insistence from the threshold would ensure that the final product would meet all the necessary global standards, it added.  \nFinding no merit in the petition, the Court rejected it.\nAdvocate N Raghavendra Rao represented the petitioner.\nDeputy Solicitor General of India H Shanthi Bhushan and advocate Sadhana Desai represented the Central government."}
{"ID": "id_67", "Summary": "The Karnataka Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) was established by the State government in a bid to shield corrupt politicians, ministers and officers from the watchful eyes of the Lokayukta, with an intention to weaken the Lokayukta, the Karnataka High Court said on Thursday [Chidananda Urs BG v State of Karnataka].\nIn a strongly worded and rather voluminous judgment running into 289 pages, a division bench of Justices B Veerappa and KS Hemalekha opined that the field occupied by the Karnataka Lokayukta Act was eroded by the constitution of the ACB. \nIt, therefore, quashed a State government order of 2016 creating the ACB, thereby, abolishing the body. \n“The very constitution of ACB by the government is to shield the corrupt politicians, ministers, and the officers from the watchful eyes of the Lokayukta and that Government is weakening the institution of Lokayukta to protect these persons from prosecution, inter alia under the provisions of the PC Act,” the judgment said.\nThis was nothing but a transgression by an executive administrative order to usurp the powers of Lokayukta, the Court added.\nThe High Court was hearing a group of petitions challenging notifications passed by the Government of Karnataka in 2016 establishing the ACB and giving it powers to investigate cases under the Prevention of Corruption Act.\nThe Court said that the Karnataka Lokayukta Act was enacted for the purpose of improving standards of public administration, by looking into complaints against administrative actions, including cases of corruption, favouritism and official indiscipline within the administration machinery.\nHowever, the same was made “paper tigers without any teeth and claws” on the executive order being passed in 2016.\nThe Court also noted that the ACB had not registered any criminal cases against the Ministers, Members of Parliament, Members of Legislative Assembly or Members of the Legislative Council, and had only registered a few cases against some authorities and conducted raids.\nThe petitioners had claimed that the notification was to make the Lokayukta defunct and would virtually defeat the very purpose for which it was constituted by creating a parallel body.\nThe State government, however, contended that the petitioners were under the wrong notion that by creating ACB, the powers entrusted to the Lokayukta were withdrawn since the ACB was working as a separate wing which had nothing to do with the institution of Lokayukta.\nThe Court, after hearing the arguments, took into account the fact that the notification establishing the ACB was passed on the recommendation of the Director General and Inspector General of Police based on the Supreme Court’s judgment in C Rangaswamaiah v Karnataka Lokayukta. The same was said to be done with the object of improving the quality of administration.\nHowever, the Court noted that if the State government actually wished to maintain the independence of the Lokayukta, it could have strengthened its hands by giving it more power or allowing the ACB to work under it.\n“Absolutely there is no independent application of mind by the State Government before passing the impugned executive order and the same is based only on the recommendation made by the DG & IG, thereby the executive order passed by the State Government cannot be sustained,” the judgment said.\nPertinently, the Court also examined the judgment in C Rangaswamaiah closely to conclude that it did not assist the State government in any way and was erroneously interpreted.\nFurther, the Court said such an executive order could only be passed through a consultative process with all stakeholders as per the Karnataka Lokayukta Act.\nExamining the executive’s power to make such a notification under Article 162 of the Constitution, the bench observed that the same was impermissible since executive instructions could only fill the gaps not covered by statutory rules, but could not be in derogation of them.\nThere is more scope for political influence in an executive order and the Chief Minister in power can misuse ACB to control his opponents within his party or the opposite parties, the Court said.\n“The conditions of the executive Government Order clearly depict that there is a possibility to favour the party in power or the party men,” the judgment said.\nThe division bench bemoaned that even after 75 years of Independence, no political party in the country dared to allow an independent authority to discharge its duties in a transparent manner in the general public’s interest.\nOn the menace of corruption, the bench said that it would prove very dangerous if a corrupt public servant continues to hold office, as it would erode the already shaken confidence of the people in such institutions besides demoralizing the other honest public servants.\n“If honest public servants are compelled to take orders from proclaimed corrupt officers on account of the suspension of the conviction, the fall out would be one of the shaking system itself,” the Court opined.\nWith these observations, the Court concluded that the State Government was not justified in constituting the ACB by an executive when the Karnataka Lokayukta Act, 1984 occupied the field to eradicate the corruption.\n“All subsequent notifications issued pursuant to the impugned Government Order dated 14.3.2016 for the purpose of formation and working of ACB, are also liable to be quashed,” the bench ordered.\nAll proceedings pending before the ACB were directed to be transferred to the Lokayukta."}
{"ID": "id_670", "Summary": "The Karnataka High Court recently held that exclusion of a married daughter for grant of an identity card (I-card) to dependents of ex-servicemen is violative of Articles 14 and 15 of the Constitution [Priyanka Patil v Kendriya Sainik Board].\nSingle-judge Justice M Nagaprasanna underscored that marriage of a woman does not change her status as a daughter and, therefore, struck down the words “till married” in the guidelines for grant of I-card.\n\"If the son remains a son, married or unmarried; a daughter shall remain a daughter, married or unmarried. If the act of marriage does not change the status of the son; the act of marriage cannot and shall not change the status of a daughter,\" the Court observed.\nIt, therefore, directed Karnataka Examination Authority to consider the petitioner's case under the ex-servicemen quota for the post of assistant professor, in terms of the notification dated August 26, 2021.\n\"I hold that exclusion of married daughter for grant of an I-card in terms of guideline 5(c) of the guidelines issuance of I-cards to dependants of ex-servicemen to be violative of Articles 14 and 15 of the Constitution of India and accordingly, I strike down and annihilate the words \"till married\" in the aforesaid guideline.\"\nPertinently, the Court said the word 'men' in the title part of word ex-servicemen, would \"demonstrate a misogynous posture of an age old masculine culture\" and hence the title, wherever it reads as ex-servicemen in the annals of policy making of the government, should be made 'ex-service personnel'.\n\"Since it is in the realm of rule making or a policy making which is the domain of the Union Government or the State Government as the case would be, it is for the Union Government or the State Government to address this imperative need of change of nomenclature wherever it depicts to be ‘ex-servicemen’ to that of ‘ex-service personnel’ which would be in tune with ever evolving, dynamic tenets, of Article 14 of the Constitution of India,\" the Court ordered.\nThe judgment was delivered on a plea by one Priyanka Patil, a married daughter of an ex-serviceman \nShe moved the Court against Karnataka Examination Authority for issuance of identity-card as her father's dependent.\nThe Karnataka government had on August 26, 2021 called for application to fill up the vacant posts of Assistant Professors in the Government First Grade colleges across the State. \nThe notification provided for reservation to ex-servicemen or the ward of ex-servicemen.\nThe counsel appearing for Priyanka contended that the guideline permits issuance of identity- card both to the daughter or son of an ex-serviceman. But the rider was that with respect to daughters, it would be issued only till the daughter gets married. \nThis criteria, it was contended, is arbitrary, discriminatory and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution.\nHe further said that but for the fact that the petitioner was married, she would have been entitled to issuance of the card which would depict her to be the ward of an ex-serviceman and it would have thus, made her eligible for reservation. \nOn the other hand, Deputy Solicitor General H Shanthi Bhushan refuted the submissions by petitioner, arguing that the moment the daughter gets married, she loses the status of being a dependent.\nFurther, it was pointed out that the guidelines lay down a cap of 25 years of age, both for the daughter and the son and no person is given the card for any benefit or even participation in any recruitment process after such person has attained 25 years of age.\nTherefore, it was submitted that there is no discrimination between sons or daughters once they reach the age of 25.\nThe bench noted that the issue in the present case did not concern a statute, but was regarding a policy in the form of a guideline. \nIt is therefore, on a lower pedestal than that of a statute, the Court said.\nIf statutes can be held to be violative of the tenets of Article 14 for the reason that it is discriminatory resulting in gender bias, a policy in the form of a guideline would pale into insignificance, if it portrays such discrimination even remotely, the Court said.\nFurther, the Court noted that the guideline after the age of 25 years was applicable uniformly for both sons and daughters.\nBut if the daughter is less than 25 years and gets married, then she loses the benefit of being a ward of an ex-serviceman for the purposes of issuance of an I-card, the Court observed.\nThis suggests that she has to remain unmarried, if she has to get the benefit of issuance of an I-card in her favour, which by itself would generate certain benefits to the wards of the ex-servicemen.\nThese are not the times where women have no role to play at all, the Court said.\nIt, therefore, opined that, there has to be a change in the mindset of the rule making authority or the policy makers and it is only then there can be recognition of commitment of the values of the Constitution, as equality should not remain a mere idle incantation, but has to be a vibrant living reality.\n\"It must be remembered that extension of women's right is the basic principle of all social progress,\" the Court added."}

{"ID": "id_673", "Summary": "The Supreme Court on Thursday delivered a split verdict in the challenge to the Karnataka government order (GO) effectively empowering government colleges in the State to ban the wearing of hijab by Muslim girl students in college campus [Aishat Shifa vs State of Karnataka].\nJustice Hemant Gupta who headed the bench upheld the government decision while Justice Sudhanshu Dhulia struck it down. \n\"There is divergence of opinion.

I have held the ratio in Bijoy Emmanuel squarely covers the case,\" Justice Dhulia ruled.\nBackground\nThe challenge before the Supreme Court is against a Karnataka High Court decision from March 15 upholding the Karnataka government order.\nThe Karnataka High Court had on March 15 upheld a Karnataka government order (GO) effectively empowering college development committees of government colleges in the State to ban the wearing of the Islamic headscarf in college campuses.\nThe petitioners - Muslim girl students from various colleges in Karnataka - had approached the High Court after they were denied permission to attend classes on account of wearing hijab.\nA three-judge Bench of then Chief Justice Ritu Raj Awasthi and Justices Krishna S Dixit and JM Khazi held that:\n- Hijab is not a part of essential religious practices of Islam;\n- Requirement of uniform is a reasonable restriction on the fundamental right to freedom of expression under Article 19(1)(a);\n- The government has the power to pass the GO; no case is made out for its invalidation.\nOne of the pleas before the top court argued that the High Court \"failed to note that the right to wear a Hijab comes under the ambit of ‘expression’ and is thus protected under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution.\"\nIt is also contended that the High Court failed to take note of the fact that the right to wear Hijab comes under the ambit of the right to privacy under Article 21 of the Constitution of India.\nWith regard to uniform, the pleas state that the Karnataka Education Act, 1983, and the Rules made under the same, do not provide for any mandatory uniform to be worn by students.\nArguments before Supreme Court\nThe appellants before the Supreme Court contended that this was a case of State failing to provide reasonable accommodation to a student exercise her right under Articles 19 and 21.\nThey also underscored that only if an attire disrupts public order, it can be restricted and it was the responsibility of the State to ensure an atmosphere was created where one could exercise their fundamental rights.\nRegarding the issue of Essential Religious Practice Test (ERP) and whether hijab is essential to Islam, the appellants contended that the only issue that needed to be considered was whether the restriction was deemed to be a valid Constitutional restriction.\nOn the other hand, some of the appellants also took a stand that everything in the Quran was mandatory and nothing was directory. Therefore, wearing the hijab was essential to Islam.\nThe appellants also claimed that the government order discriminated against on the grounds of both religion and sex.\nThe State government, on the other hand, maintained that the order was \"religion-neutral\" and did not target any particular community.\nThe court was informed that the female Muslim students challenging the hijab ban never wore hijab to educational institutions until 2021, but suddenly started the practice on advice by someone else when a movement designed to create an agitation was started on social media by the Popular Front of India.\nIt was also the government's submission that an ERP was only one that could be traced back to the origin of a religion itself or was so compelling that one could not fathom the religion without it."}

In any case, the operative part of the order is very clear and there was absolutely no ambiguity.\"\nOnly to avoid creating any further hurdles, the High Court clarified its order by adding Section 302 in its previous order.\nThe Court also asked the trial court to explain its stand through a report to be furnished to the Court within 10 days.\nOther than murder, Shaikh was also charged with offences under Sections 306 (abetment to suicide), 307 (attempt to murder), 494 (marrying again during life-time of spouse), 498(A) (cruelty by husband or his relatives), 504 (intentional insult), 511 (attempt to commit offence) of the IPC.\nThe informant in the case, who is the deceased had allegedly poured petrol on herself and visited the applicant's house with whom the informant's husband was allegedly having an extra marital affair. \nVagal submitted to the Court that the informant held serious grudge against the applicant and her intention to implicate the applicant in a false case was clear as she had carried the match stick with herself.\nThe Court conceded that at this stage sufficient doubt had been created against the prosecution case, the investigation was over and chargesheet had been filed. In view of this, bail was granted. \nThe trial court's refusal to abide by the clear directions of the High Court \"seriously affected the applicant's valuable right of getting bail at the earliest\", Justice Kotwal noted. \nHe expressed his concern that despite his order, the applicant had to suffer in jail for more period than was necessary, particularly when she has a 10-month-old child with her. \n\"Considering the repeated concerns expressed by the Hon’ble Supreme Court regarding unnecessary crowding of the jail, the attitude of the trial court is not proper in this case\" Justice Kotwal said reprimanding the trial court."}

The State finally refused permission just before the petitioners approached the High Court. \nThe broad reasons behind the State refusing permission included the existence of mosques and churches and a regional office of the DMK along some of the proposed routes and potential traffic congestion on some narrow roads, the Court noted.\nSuch grounds, the Court held, could not be considered as valid ones for refusing permission.\n“The tenor of the rejection order certainly not in tune with secular or democratic way of governance. It is neither in obedience or compliance of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India dictum. By citing the existence of the structures, place of worship of other religion or office of some organizations, which do not share the same ideology of RSS, the request of RSS to conduct procession and public meeting is rejected. This order is contrary to the principle of secularism which is the foundation of our Constitution of India,” the Court said.\nThe Court accordingly allowed a batch of petitions filed by local and State-level members of the RSS seeking such permission.\nIt however, directed the State authorities and the participants of the route march to ensure the route march and public meetings are held “peacefully.”\nSenior Counsel G Rajagopalan, G Karthikeyan and NL Rajah and advocate Rabu Manohar appeared for the petitioner RSS members.\nAdvocate General R Shunmugasundaram, Government advocate S Santosh, Advocate AG Shakeenaa, SPP and Senior Counsel Hasan Mohammed Jinnah and Government Advocate Udhaya Kumar appeared for the State government and TN Police.\nThe same issue had come up before the Court in October last year when the RSS sought the State government's permission to carry out its march and public meetings at several locations across the State to mark Gandhi Jayanti and 75 years of India’s independence.\nHowever, the State government had refused permission citing intelligence reports anticipating law and order problems. The RSS had then approached the Madras High Court.\nOn November 4 that year, a single-judge had given the RSS permission to conduct the march subject to certain conditions like restricting the march indoors or in enclosed spaces.\nOn February 10, a division bench of the High Court had lifted these restrictions and emphasised the importance of protests in a healthy democracy."}
{"ID": "id_679", "Summary": "The Madhya Pradesh High Court recently observed that when a girl, who has attained the age of discretion, leaves her parents' house to be with a boy who facilitates the same, it will not amount to kidnapping or abduction [Manoj Sahu vs State of Madhya Pradesh].\nJustice Dinesh Kumar Paliwal, therefore, set aside an order of a trial court at Umariya district of Madhya Pradesh convicting the appellant for abducting a girl in December 2019. \nThe judge noted that neither could the prosecution prove the case of kidnapping against the accused nor the age of victim.\n\"In this case prosecution has failed to establish that at the time of commission of offence the age of prosecutrix was below 18 years of age. Even if it was on the border line, there is sufficient evidence to establish that she attained the age of discretion. Where a prosecutrix at the age of discretion leaves her parental home and the accused simply facilitates her in fulfillment of her desire, it can not be said to be an act of kidnapping or abduction,\" the judge observed.\nThe factual matrix of the case was that in 2016 the alleged minor victim aged 17 year and 6 months had left her house for school but did not return. \nIncidentally, the same day, the appellant who lived in the same village, was also untraceable and the girl's father alleged that he might have lured and kidnapped his daughter.\nA first information report was registered against the appellant at Umariya Police Station based on the father's complaint for the offence of kidnapping under Section 363 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). \nThe trial court convicted the appellant leading to the appeal before the High Court.\nIn his order, Justice Paliwal noted that neither the girl nor her parents could show any evidence to prove that her age was below 18 years old.\nThe Court noted that the victim had deposed that she had on her own free made a call to the appellant, went to Nagpur with him and remained with him for 6 to 7 months before coming to Umaria. \nFurther, the High Court said that there was no evidence that the accused had taken the girl forcibly or that she was below 18 years of age.\n\"There is no evidence on record to show that she was taken forcibly or was induced by appellant/accused to go to Nagpur. On meticulous scrutiny of evidence of prosecutrix it can be easily inferred that she who was above 18 years of age at the time of occurrence had gone with the accused voluntarily\", the judgment stated.\nTherefore, the Court acquitted Manoj."}
{"ID": "id_68", "Summary": "In order to prove that a will is genuine and where its attesting witnesses are not found, it is not enough to merely examine a random witness who claims that he saw the attesting witness sign the will, the Supreme Court recently held [Moturu Nalini Kanth vs Gainedi Kaliprasad].\nRather, the bench of Justices CT Ravikumar and Sanjay Kumar underscored that Section 69 of the Indian Evidence Act should be strictly complied with. \nSection 69 deals with cases where the attesting witness (es) cannot be found. \nIn such cases, the provision says that (in order to prove the authenticity of a will) there should be proof that the attestation by at least one attesting witness is in his handwriting and that the person executing the will (executant or the testator) has signed the document in his handwriting. \n\"For the purposes of Section 69 of the Evidence Act, it is not enough to merely examine a random witness who asserts that he saw the attesting witness affix his signature in the Will. The very purpose and objective of insisting upon examination of at least one attesting witness to the Will would be entirely lost if such requirement is whittled down to just having a stray witness depose that he saw the attesting witness sign the Will,\" the Court explained. \nThe Court was dealing with an appeal by one Nalini Kanth (appellant) who claimed that he was adopted by a septuagenarian woman (testator) when he was less than a year old in the 1980s and that he was entitled to a share in her property.\nThe alleged adoptive mother passed away three months after the purported adoption ceremony, leaving behind a freshly made will and entrusting the duty to carry out her funeral rites to her newly adopted son. As per the new will, Nalini Kanth was to inherit her property. \nWhat followed was a challenge to this claim by the grandson of the deceased woman, who stated that he was the real claimant to the property. \nThe trial court ruled in favour of Kanth. However, on appeal, the High Court reversed the order and held that the adoption deed itself was not sustainable. \nKanth then challenged the High Court order before the Supreme Court. \nThe top court found several aspects that threw doubt on the authenticity of the will as well as Kanth's 'adoption.'\nIt found that the contents of the will appeared to have been dictated by a woman who was not the actual testator. \nThe scribe who transcribed the contents of the disputed will said that he did not even see the person whose will was being made, nor did he see the testator (executant/ alleged adoptive mother) sign the will. Further, the attesting witnesses were also not seen signing the document. \nIn this backdrop, the top court noted that Section 69 of the Evidence Act could have been made use of to prove the validity of the will. However, no witness was examined who was familiar with the signature of either of the attesting witnesses or who could vouch for the same or produce an admitted signature before the trial court.\n\"The contention that Section 69 of the Evidence Act does not require actual proof of the handwriting of at least one attesting witness and proof of the signature of the executant being in that person’s handwriting cannot be accepted,\" the Court added. \nMoreover, the adoption itself was thrown into doubt on account of various discrepancies. \nThe top court emphasised that an actual act of \"giving and taking\" of the child in adoption is an essential requisite under Section 11(vi) of the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956, which did not take place in this case. \n\"We find that there is no convincing evidence of that ‘act’ also in the case on hand. Interestingly, there are no pictures of the actual ‘giving and taking’ of the child in adoption,\" Supreme Court said.\nThe Supreme Court concluded that the very adoption itself was not believable and that Nalini Kanth could not, therefore, be treated as the testator's heir by adoption.\nThe apex court also found it strange that the testator expected Kanth to perform her funeral rites, given that Kanth was a toddler when the testator passed away.\n\"It is difficult to believe that a woman of such advanced years would willingly take on the responsibility of caring for an infant at that age,\" the Court further noted.\nAll of these factors ultimately led the top court to dismiss Kanth's claim to the woman's property. \nAccordingly, his appeal was dismissed and the High Court's order upheld."}

The grant of child care leave to the appellant cannot be used to disentitle her to maternity leave under Rule 43 of the [Central Civil Servcies] Rules of 1972 ... Unless a purposive interpretation were to be adopted in the present case, the object and intent of the grant of maternity leave would simply be defeated\" the Bench noted. \nThe Bench was hearing a matter where a government employee, working as a nurse at the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh (PGIMER), was denied maternity leave for her biological child for already having availed such leave for two of her other kids. \nThe two children were her husband's kids from his previous marriage. \nThe Central Administrative Tribunal and the Punjab & Haryana High Court had dismissed her plea for allowance as per maternity leave benefits in the Central Civil Service Rules of 2013.\nThis led to the present appeal before the Supreme Court. \nThe counsel for the respondents had submitted that the purpose of restricting maternity leave to the two eldest surviving children was to encourage smaller families. \nJustice Chandrachud, however, said that her plight of having kids from her husband's previous marriage was not voluntary.\n\"She got married into such a family. So your argument won't apply.\"\nThe Bench made it clear that grant of maternity leave is intended to encourage women to join and continue in the workplace. \n\"It is a harsh reality that but for such provisions, many women would be compelled by social circumstances to give up work on the birth of a child, if they are not granted leave and other facilitative measures. No employer can perceive child birth as detracting from the purpose of employment. Child birth has to be construed in the context of employment as a natural incident of life and hence, the provisions for maternity leave must be construed in that perspective\" the Court said.\nIt, therefore, held that the appellant is entitled to the grant of maternity leave, and set aside the orders of the High Court and the Tribunal. \n\"The OA filed by the appellant shall in consequence stand allowed and the appellant shall be granted maternity leave under Rule 43 in terms of the present judgment. The benefits which are admissible to the appellant shall be released to her within a period of two months from the date of this order.\"\nAdvocate Akshay Verma appeared for the appellant, and advocate Sudarshan Rajan represented the respondents with the exception of the Tribunal."}

No hard and fast rule can be applied. There are myriad situations in the case of matrimonial discord between parents, where the child’s passport application may have to be considered by the authorities,” the court said.\nThe court said that the Passport Manual 2020 and the Office Memorandum (OM) issued by the Ministry of External Affairs in February 2022 recognise several situations where the exclusion of the name of father from a minor's passport is permissible.\nIt rejected the argument that the OM would apply only to single unwed parents. \n“Passport Manual 2020 clearly recognizes several situations/ conditions where the exclusion of the name of the father from the minor’s passport is permissible. Clause 4.1 itself clearly enables a single parent to apply for a passport without mentioning the name of the other parent. Clause 4.2 carves out a specific category relating to unwed single parents,\" the bench said. \nIt further noted that the language used in clause 4.1 is merely single parent. \n\"Clause 4.3, clearly mentions that in the case of married parents the name of the father shall be furnished by the other single parent having the custody of the child, irrespective of the status of the marriage i.e divorce, divorce pending, separated etc., However, the mere furnishing of the name does not result in the conclusion that the name of the father has to be compulsorily mentioned. It would depend on the circumstances of each case,” the court said.\nThe court was dealing with a plea filed by a single-mother and her minor child seeking deletion of the name of the biological father from the passport of the latter.\nIt was stated that the father had deserted the woman during her pregnancy. The settlement between the two revealed that the neither the woman nor the son were given any alimony or maintenance and the exclusive custody of child was to be with the mother.\nAfter considering the case, the bench said that the facts in the case were quite peculiar and, therefore, Clause 4.5.1 of Chapter 8 and Clause 4.1 of Chapter 9 would be applicable here.\n“In the unique and peculiar circumstances of this case, it is accordingly directed that the name of the father of Petitioner No.2 (child) be deleted from the passport and the passport be re-issued in favour of the minor child without the name of the father,” the Court finally ordered.\nJustice Singh, however, clarified that this order shall not be treated as a precedent.\nSmita Maan, the petitioner, appeared in person.\nCentral Government Standing Counsel (CGSC) Rakesh Kumar along with advocates Sunil,Mr. Giriraj Shrama and Prince Roshan appeared for the Central government\nThe Delhi government was represented through its Additional Standing Counsel Mehak Nakra and Abhishek Khari."}

It further means that the party workers of Bhartiya Janata Party will accept such person/persons as their leader. This imputation is prima facie defamatory in nature,\" the Court said while refusing Gandhi's plea.\nThe case arose after BJP leader Navin Jha filed a complaint against Gandhi, alleging that Gandhi delivered a speech on March 18, 2018 criticizing the BJP and accusing Shah of being involved in murder.\nInitially, a magistrate court at Ranchi dismissed Jha's complaint prompting him to file a revision petition before the Judicial Commissioner in Ranchi.\nThe judicial commissioner in Ranchi on September 15, 2018 overturned the order that dismissed the complaint petition and sent it back to the magistrate court.\nThe judicial commissioner directed the magistrate to review the evidence on record again and issue a fresh order regarding the determination of prima facie material to proceed with the matter.\nThereafter, the magistrate passed a fresh order on November 28, 2018 and concluded that there was sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case against Gandhi under Section 500 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) which penalises defamation. Consequently, the magistrate issued a summons for Gandhi's appearance.\nGandhi then moved the High Court challenging the Ranchi judicial commissioner's order of September 15, 2018.\nThe High Court observed that, on the face of it, the statement suggested that Gandhi implied that the leadership of the BJP was intoxicated with power and consisted of deceitful individuals.\n\"It further means that the party workers of Bhartiya Janata Party will accept such person/persons as their leader.

RR Kishore]\nSection 6A had provided that prior Central government sanction was mandatory before the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) could conduct investigations in corruption cases against Union government bureaucrats from the rank of Joint-Secretary onwards.\nHowever, in a 2014 decision, in the case of Subramanian Swamy vs Director CBI, the apex court struck down Section 6A (1) on the ground that it was violative of Article 14 (right to equality) of the Constitution of India. \nIn the 2014 decision, the top court had held that there cannot be a distinction between officials based on their status and rank.\nThe 2014 ruling had, however, not clarified what would happen to existing cases being probed by the central agency.\nA constitution bench was, therefore, constituted to examine whether the 2014 decision would affect existing corruption cases. \nA bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul, Sanjiv Khanna, Abhay S Oka, Vikram Nath, and JK Maheshwari has now answered this question in the affirmative and held that the 2014 judgment would have retrospective effect. \nThe Court clarified that Section 6A will be considered as never having been in force.\nThe bench, however, added that it has not decided on any case or appeal on merits.\n\"Once a law is declared to be unconstitutional, being violative of Part-III of the Constitution, then it would be held to be void ab initio, still born, unenforceable and non est in view of Article 13(2) of the Constitution and its interpretation by authoritative pronouncements. Thus, the declaration made by the Constitution Bench in the case of Subramanian Swamy (supra) will have retrospective operation ... this Court has not delved into the other issues and arguments not germane to the reference order,\" the Court said.\nThe verdict, reserved on November 3 last year, came on a case dealing with the following questions of law: \n(i) Whether Section 6A of the DSPE Act is part of procedure or it introduces a conviction or sentence? \n(ii) Whether Article 20(1) of the Constitution will have any bearing or relevance in the context of declaration of Section 6A of the DSPE Act as unconstitutional? \n(iii) [Whether] The declaration of Section 6A of the DSPE Act as unconstitutional and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution would have a retrospective effect or would apply prospectively from the date of its declaration as unconstitutional?\nThe Court has determined that Section 6A is a part of the legal procedure exclusively applicable to senior government servants.\n\"Section 6A of the DSPE Act does not lay down or introduce any conviction for any offence. It is a procedural safeguard only which is enumerated in Section 6A of the DSPE Act with regard to making of an investigation or enquiry of an offence under the PC Act, 1988. Section 6A of the DSPE Act also does not lay down any sentence nor does it alter any existing sentence for an offence.\"\nFurther, it found that Article 20(1) of the Constitution had no bearing on the constitutionality of Section 6A of the DSPE Act.\nArticle 20(1) lays down that no person shall be convicted of any offence except for violation of the law in force at the time of the commission of the act.\n\"Article 20(1) of the Constitution only and only confines to conviction and sentence. It does not at all refer to any procedural part which may result into conviction or acquittal and/or sentence ... Change in procedure post the offence not attracting Article 20(1) of Constitution has been the settled law.\"\nIn the instant case, the accused was arrested while accepting a bribe. The accused had challenged the prosecution for want of sanction. The Delhi High Court had earlier directed the central agency to get the necessary approvals and restart the probe. \nWhile a challenge to the High Court decision was pending before the top court, the 2014 decision in the Subramanian Swamy case was delivered. \nSolicitor General (SG) Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Central government, had submitted that Article 20 does not apply to procedural provisions. \nSenior Advocates Arvind Datar and Amit Desai, appearing for an accused (one Manjit Singh Bali), argued that Section 6A of the DSPE Act had been an immunity not just from conviction but also from investigation, and that such procedural safeguards are part of Article 20.\nHe added that after a provision is struck down, the Court must specify as to how it would take effect with respect to being prospective or retrospective. \nDuring the course of the hearings, Justice Kaul had earlier suggested that perhaps the courts can clarify this aspect as and when needed.\nAdditional Solicitor General (ASG) SV Raju, appearing for the CBI, stated that Section 6A had not been an immunity against trial, which can commence without sanction."}

The marriage was never consummated due to the unilateral decision of the wife to refuse sexual intercourse for considerable period without having valid reason, the bench noted.  \nThe Court further noted that despite the said contention of the husband, the wife didn't contest the same and therefore, the contentions or pleadings of the husband cannot be discarded and has to be accepted as it is.\nThe Court said the family court erred in holding that the denial on part of wife to consummate a marriage would not be a ground to dissolve a marriage.\n\"We are unable to accept the findings of the Family Court in the issue of absence of consummation of marriage or physical intimacy. The Supreme Court has already accepted such an act (of refusing to consummate marriage) of the wife as mental cruelty,\" the bench underlined.\nFurther, it said that there cannot be a straight-jacket formula or fixed parameters for determining mental cruelty in matrimonial matters.  \n\"The prudent and appropriate way to adjudicate the case would be to evaluate it on its peculiar facts and circumstances while taking the relevant factors in consideration,\" the Court explained.\nIt further noted that the wife was very much aware that the husband would leave India in a short period of time after the marriage. \n\"During this period, the husband was hopeful to consummate the marriage but the same was denied by the wife and certainly this act (of wife) amounts to mental cruelty,\" the Court held.  \nHence, it quashed and set aside the judgment of the family court. \nThe husband had appeared as a party-in-person. \nNone appeared for the Wife."}

UOI & Ors.].\nThe plea was filed by one Manoranjan Roy, a tax volunteer who accused the RBI of failing to follow proper procedures and helping undeserving beneficiaries to get their unaccounted ₹500 and ₹1,000 notes exchanged during the demonetisation drive.\nRoy relied on information obtained through the Right to Information Act (RTI Act) and annual reports to claim that RBI engaged in a huge scam. He also filed a complaint with the Central Economic Intelligence Bureau in 2018.\nHowever, a division bench of Justices AS Gadkari and Sharmila Deshmukh observed that this complaint failed to disclose the commission of any offence or any irregularity or illegality as alleged by Roy. \nIn view of this, no criminality could be fastened upon RBI which could attract even an inquiry, the Court said.\n“It cannot be disputed that the RBI plays an important role in shaping the economy of our country and the courts should refrain from delving into the monetary regulatory framework unless it is shown to the satisfaction of the court that there is a need for an investigation by an independent agency,” the Court added.\nThe Court also observed that Roy had been persistently seeking an investigation into the statutory functioning of the RBI since 2015. \nHowever, his claims of irregularities were not supported by any independent financial expert, the bench found. \n“Neither the pleadings nor the complaint is supported by the report of an independent financial expert demonstrating that the discrepancies point out to the commission of an offence so as to entail a detailed inquiry or investigation,” the Court noted in its September 8 judgment.\nIn the absence of such information, the High Court opined that the petition is nothing but a fishing enquiry and dismissed the same. \n“In our opinion, the present Petition is nothing but a fishing inquiry into what the Petitioner perceives to be a scam based on various figures set out in the annual reports as well as the information given under the RTI.

{"ID": "id_704", "Summary": "A woman cannot be forced to give birth to the child of a man who had sexually assaulted her, the Allahabad High Court held recently while considering a plea to terminate a 25-week pregnancy carried by a 12-year-old who was raped.\nTo fasten the responsibility of motherhood on women who are sexually assaulted would violate their right to live with dignity and result in unexplained miseries, the Court said. \nA Bench of Justice Mahesh Chandra Tripathi and Justice Prashant Kumar added that the woman has a right to say yes or no to being a mother.\n\"In the case of sexual assault, denying a women right to say no to medical termination of pregnancy and fasten her with responsibility of motherhood would amount to denying her human right to live with dignity as she has a right in relation to her body which includes saying Yes or No to being a mother. Section 3(2) of the MTP Act reiterates that right of a woman. To force the victim to give birth to child of a man who sexually assaulted would result in unexplainable miseries (sic),\" the judgment stated. \nThe main issue before the Court was whether it could allow a plea for abortion made by a 12-year-old rape victim who was deaf and mute and whose pregnancy had exceeded 24 weeks. \nThe minor girl was subjected to rape and sexual assault multiple times by her neighbour. However, due to her inability to speak, she could not narrate her ordeal to anyone for a long time, the Court was told. \nLater, when her mother enquired about the same, the victim used sign language to disclose that she had been raped. \nHer mother then lodged a first information report (FIR) for rape and offences under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO Act). \nWhen the victim was medically examined last month, it was found that her pregnancy was at 23 weeks. \nA request to terminate the pregnancy was eventually placed before a Medical Board on June 27. The Board opined that since the pregnancy had exceeded 24 weeks, the Court's permission was required before the abortion could be conducted. \nThe Court noted that there were provisions in the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act (MTP Act) that specifically laid down rape and minority of the mother as grounds to terminate a pregnancy that was up to 24 weeks. Further, the Act also provided for a presumption that a rape victim's mental health would be adversely affected by a pregnancy resulting from rape. \nThe Court acknowledged that the MTP Act did not ordinarily permit termination of pregnancies beyond 24 weeks, except where there were significant fetal abnormalities.\nHowever, the Bench pointed out that constitutional courts, including the Supreme Court, have allowed the termination of pregnancies beyond 24 weeks in exceptional cases. \nTaking a humanitarian view of the matter, and given the urgency, the Court proceeded to order a medical hospital to examine the child within a day's time. A report was also directed to be submitted by the hospital in sealed cover by July 12. \nAdvocate Raghav Arora represented the petitioner."}

Under the circumstances also the reliance placed upon Section 4(1)(2) of the RTI Act is also misconceived and misplaced.\"\nThe order was passed on a plea by journalist and transparency activist Saurav Das, filed through advocate Prashant Bhushan.\n\"Citizens have a legal and constitutional right to proactive disclosure of chargesheets because the right to know is a fundamental right emanating from the Right to Freedom of Speech and Expression enshrined under Article 19(1)(a)...to induce transparency, it is incumbent on the Respondents to make available chargesheets on their websites and enable public access to chargesheets so that the citizenry can stay informed, and the press can faithfully and accurately report on criminal trials,\" the plea stated.\nThe petitioner also flagged the issue of fake news that can arise from selective or inaccurate leaks of chargesheets, leading to media trials.  \n\"Since the entire chargesheet is not available in the public domain, selectively leaked information can be used to form biased opinions by spreading propaganda-laden content, manufactured especially to mislead and confuse a largely social media audience, thereby leading to unsubstantiated claims by interested parties.\" \nIn this regard, the petitioner relied on Section 173 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), which deals with how final reports by investigative agencies are to be handled by a magistrate.\n\"With the filing of the charge-sheet, the investigation is closed and the defence that investigation might get impeded does not stand at all.\"\nDuring the hearing of the matter on January 9, Bhushan had submitted that the Court is only to pass similar directions like was done in the case of Youth Bar Association, where first information reports (FIRs) were directed to be uploaded online within 24 hours.\nThe Court in its judgment today, however, said that a chargesheet cannot be equated to an FIR since a chargesheet is not a public document under the Indian Evidence Act. \nAdvocate Ria Yadav also appeared for the petitioner."}

The first plea in this regard was moved by M Shivaraju. The State Election Commission (SEC) filed the second plea, while the third petition was moved by Ravi Jajan.\nAdvocate General Prabhuling Navadgi, appearing for the State, had supported the recently enacted Karnataka Municipal Corporation Third Amendment Act, 2020, (Amendment Act).\nThe State Legislature had amended the Karnataka Municipal Corporations Act to increase the number of wards from 198 to 225, pending the enactment of a separate law for the administration of the BBMP.\nNavadgi argued that a validly constituted legislation can only be struck down on three limited grounds – for lacking legislative competence, for violating fundamental rights, and if found to be ‘manifestly arbitrary’. In the absence of such a finding on these limited grounds, the government cannot be directed to ignore a law validly enacted by the State Legislature, he added.\nOn the prayer raised by the petitioner seeking timely conduct of BBMP elections, Navadgi clarified that the State government had no objection to the same. In fact, he said that it would wholeheartedly welcome all directions with respect to the timelines within which the new delimitation process and subsequent elections are to be held.\nRegarding timely conduct of BBMP elections, Navadgi clarified that the government had no objection to the same. In fact, he said that it would wholeheartedly welcome all directions with respect to the timelines within which the new delimitation process and subsequent elections are to be held.\nAppearing for one of the petitioners, Professor Ravivarma Kumar argued that the State Election Commission (SEC) had addressed nearly a dozen communications urging the government to perform the statutory duty of delimitation and reservation of wards from July 2018, to no avail. Therefore, the SEC was forced to approach the High Court seeking directions to the State, said Kumar.\nEither the SEC or the petitioners have to approach the Court each time to compel the State to conduct elections, he argued. In 2015, there was a delay in holding BBMP elections, and in 2020, there is a delay in holding Grama Panchayats elections, Kumar elaborated.\nKumar also pointed out that the BBMP's term came to an end on September 10 this year. He also informed the Court that there is no provision in law to appoint an administrator.\nSenior Advocate KN Phanindra, representing the SEC, submitted that it may not be possible to hold elections to the BBMP for one year, as the process of delimitation to carve out 225 new wards will take six months. Thereafter, another six months would be required to fix reservation and to prepare a new voters list, he said.\nThe plea filed by Shivaraju submitted that as per Article 243-U (3), there is a mandatory obligation on the part of the State government to ensure that the elections to the BBMP are conducted before the expiry of such term, i.e. before September 10 in the present case.\nIdeally, the steps to conduct elections ought to have been taken several months in advance so as to facilitate the conducting of elections before the said date, says the plea.\nHowever, till date, absolutely no steps have been taken on the part of the State to prepare electoral rolls, to notify reservations, etc. to the 198 wards in Bengaluru. The respondents have wilfully disobeyed to fulfil their constitutional duty of conducting timely elections, the plea averred.\nOn these grounds, the plea had sought to direct the State to conduct elections to the BBMP in accordance with Article 243-U and Section 8 of the Karnataka Municipal Corporations Act, 1976.\nThis apart, the plea also challenged the Amendment Act as it seeks to increase the number of wards to 225."}

Such an apocalypse would adversely affect the growth of the country,” the Court noted. \nAfter a detailed consideration of the facts and material on record, the High Court held that the balance of convenience in this matter lay with the people of the country at large \nIt emphasised that should the predictions regarding third wave turn out to be true, children of the country could be affected and the damage will be catastrophic.\nIt, therefore, stayed the State decision. \n“It is in the interest of the public to stay the operation of cabinet decision dated June 25 and to direct the government not to permit pilgrims to reach Char Dham temples,\" the order said. \nIt also suggested live streaming of the ceremonies so that devotees can witness the same from their homes. \nA report was sought from the State regarding the same. \nDuring the hearing of the case on Monday, the Bench also took exception to the affidavit filed by the State stating that the same was plagued with vague and unclear data.\n“The Government must be honest with the Court. It has purposely tried to mislead the Court with its data. The High Court cannot be taken lightly by the Government. You can be hauled up for perjury,” the Court said. \nChief Justice RS Chauhan noted that the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Kumbh Mela was very similar to the one submitted for the Char Dham Yatra pointing out the obvious concern of how the State had failed to implement the SOP for Kumbh. \n “Yet it is common knowledge that despite the best intentions of the State Government the district authorities singularly failed to implement the SOP. A large segment of the pilgrims neither wore a mask nor maintained social distancing nor used sanitisers or soap to wash their hands. In fact, lakhs of people were permitted to gather at the banks of the Holy Ganges and bathe,” the Court noted. \nThe Bench further highlighted the lapses on the part of the Uttarakhand government during Ganga Darshan. \nThe Court observed that there were glaring examples of the State government’s inability to implement its own SOPs despite their repeated reassurance.\n“Even recently, on the occasion of Ganga Darshan a crowd of more than 1 Lakh congregated together at Haridwar to take a holy bath in the Ganges. Even then the crowd failed to adhere to the SOP and the civil administration failed to strictly implement SOP. This is the fourth occasion that the State Government is promising that the SOP would be implemented strictly,” the Court said. \nThe High Court also revisited the devastation caused in the State of Uttarakhand after the Kumbh Mela, visuals from which caused embarrassment to the country and shocked the world community.\n“Suddenly our country was painted as a renegade, and as an irresponsible member of international community. Suddenly, flights coming from India were stopped by other countries.”\nThe Court also questioned the State with respect to implementation of the 'dos and don'ts' laid down in the SOP. \nAs per the procedure, there is a ban imposed on gutka, pan and tambaku but no clarification was provided in the affidavit or the hearing regarding how people will be prevented from chewing paa, gutka or tambaku in such a large crowd.\nFurther, the Bench found the procedure for implementation of sanitisation and handwashing unclear.\nOn being questioned regarding maintenance of Covid-19 protocol, it was submitted that best efforts will be made to ensure that compliance . \nHowever, the Chief Justice stated, “It is one thing to try and another to succeed. Can you assure us that if there is a death due to Covid-19 and the same is caused due to the Char Dham Yatra, you will compensate each such death with 4-5 Lakhs.”\nIt was observed that a similar question was raised regarding the Ratha Yatra in Orissa before the Supreme Court of India.\n“At that time, tackling the first wave, the Hon’ble Supreme Court directed the State of Orissa to ensure that all entry points to the city of Puri should be closed during the time of the Ratha Yatra in order to prevent people from joining the Yatra. The Hon’ble Supreme Court had also ordered a curfew in the city of Puri.”\nAfter a detailed consideration of the facts, the High Court held that the balance of convenience in this matter lay in favour of interest of public at large and stayed the government decision. \nThe Court also recommended a safer alternative to the devotees to witness the Yatra from the comfort of their homes.\n“This Court is well aware of the high religiosity of our people. Therefore, on an earlier occasion this Court had suggested that keeping in mind, people’s devotion live-streaming of all ceremonies carried out at Char Dham should be done.”\nReplying to the Advocate General's submission that live streaming of Char Dham is against the customs and prohibited by our Shastras, the Court stated that our ancestors were not aware of this technology and, therefore, the shastras could not have prohibited it. \nFurther, it was noted that this approach is being implemented by several other temples across the country.\n“The government must ensure that live streaming is done throughout the length and breadth of the country.”\nA report was sought regarding the same which has to be submitted before the Court by the next date of hearing.\nThe Bench also observed that since the Order of the State dated 25 June was not actually under challenge, it cannot be stayed. \nHowever, the Court shirked technical hurdles with the intent to protect citizens.\n\"Technicalities of law cannot come in the way of protection of the people. The writ petitions deal with the ways and means of containing the spread of COVID-19 pandemic.. over a period of time, this Court has been monitoring the steps taken by the State Government for containing the spread of COVID-19 pandemic.”\nThe Court listed the matter for further consideration on July 7."}
{"ID": "id_716", "Summary": "State cannot discriminate against men, the Rajasthan High Court recently said while quashing an October 1996 order of the Rajasthan State Electricity Board (RSEB) appointing only women as lower division clerk (LDC) under a compassionate scheme [Ashish Arora vs Rajasthan State Electricity Board].\nReferring to provisions of Articles 14 and 16, the Court held that the same indicate that in matters of recruitment to employment, the State will not discriminate between men and women and that a citizen will not be ineligible for employment or office under the State on the ground of sex only.\n\"The exclusion of male candidates for getting compassionate appointment on the post of LDC is based solely on gender discrimination and the same is also in violation of Rajasthan State Electricity Board Ministerial Staff Regulations, 1962,\" the Court held.\nSingle-judge Justice Anoop Kumar Dhand noted that Article 14 of the Constitution of India prohibits the State from denying any person equality before the law or equal protection of the laws and Article 15(1) prohibits discrimination on the ground of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth.\n\"Therefore, no citizen shall be discriminated on the grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth. Article 16 takes its root from Article 14 and ensures equality of opportunity in the matters of employment under the State. Therefore, the fundamental right to equality means that persons in like situations, under like circumstances, should be treated alike,\" the judge observed in his April 26 order.\nThe judgment was passed on petitions filed by two men who argued that despite them possessing the eligible qualifications, the RSEB did not appoint them as LDCs citing the government order of October 17, 1996. The petitioners pointed out that they were instead given the job of helper (group I).\nThe RSEB, however, justified its October 1996 decision saying that since large number of men had applied under the compassionate scheme, they were given jobs as helpers while women were taken as LDCs since only few of them applied.\nThe Court, however, noted that such an order was in violation of the Constitutional provisions as well as Rajasthan State Electricity Board Ministerial Staff Regulations, 1962.\nArticle 14 of the Constitution of India ensures equality and its main object is to protect persons similarly placed against discriminatory treatment, the judge underlined.\n\"The equality before law guaranteed under Articles 14, 15 and 16 of the Constitution of India is a constitutional admonition against both the legislative and executive organs of the State. Therefore, neither the legislature nor the Rule making Authority can make a law or a Rule, issue any guidelines or circulars or even administrative instructions, which would be in violation of Articles 14 and 15,\" the Court said\nA classification by the State should be rational and have a reasonable nexus with the object sought to be achieved.\n\"The respondents cannot discriminate against the petitioners to get appointment on the post of LDC merely because similar female candidates were less in number in comparison to male candidates. Thus, the order of the RSEB is held to be violative of Articles 14 and 16 and accordingly the same is hereby quashed,\" the bench ruled.\nIn the present case, the challenge was not against a statute but a guideline and such guideline stands at a much lower pedestal than a statute, the Court said.\n\"The issue in hand does not concern a statute, but a guideline in the form of a policy; a policy in the form of a guideline, it is therefore, on a lower pedestal than that of a statute. If statutes are held to be violative of the tenets of Article 14 by the Constitutional Courts for the reason that it depicts discrimination resulting in gender bias, a guideline in the form of policy would pale into insignificance, if it portrays such discrimination, even to its remotest sense,\" the bench observed.\nWith these observations, the bench quashed the RSEB order.\nAdvocate Punit Singhvi appeared for the petitioners.\nAdvocates Aveesh Mourya and HC Mourya represented the State authorities."}

{"ID": "id_718", "Summary": "The Patna High Court has given the green light for political parties to erect hoardings and banners on private property during an election campaign, with the written consent of the owner/occupier of the property (Century Business Pvt Ltd v. Chief Electoral Officer & Ors).\nThe Court was considering a petition filed by Century Business, which was commissioned by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to put up 950 hoardings on its properties across Bihar.\nThe matter involved the interpretation of Section 3 of the Bihar Prevention of Defacement Act, 1987. The provision allows private property owners to consent in writing to the use of their property by a person or persons contesting an election. The question arose as to whether occupiers/owners could similarly permit political parties to use their property.\nThe Single Bench of Justice Ashutosh Kumar opined that permitting only individual candidates as opposed to political parties to raise hoardings would effectively \"emasculate\" the legislature’s intention in enacting the 1987 Act.\nHolding that the reference to the Representation of People Act and political party symbols indicated that political parties could also erect hoardings, the Bench stated:\n\"A political party does not exist in vacuum and is not an abstract entity. It consists of persons.\"\nCentury had earlier sought the permission of the Chief Electoral Officer to put up hoardings. The Electoral Officer rejected the request, stating that Section 3(3) of the 1987 Act specifically allowed occupiers of property to give written consent to put up campaign hoardings and posters only to persons contesting an election.\nDuring proceedings before the High Court, counsel for the Electoral Officer reiterated the stance taken earlier. It was contended that the legislature had deliberately excluded political parties as a class from the privilege of putting up hoardings, since individual candidates were constrained by budgetary limits and would not spend more than was necessary.\nOn the other hand, if a political party were allowed to put up hoardings on private property “the entire State would stand defaced and it would be very difficult to restore the same without spending huge public money\", it was contended.\nThe petitioner pointed out that most candidates contest elections as a member of a political party and there could not be a dichotomy between person/persons and the parties to which they belonged.\nCentury referred to a similar law against the defacement of property that was in force in Jharkhand. In that state, the Chief Electoral Officer permitted political parties to put up hoardings.\nThe petitioner also submitted that allowing hoardings would help in controlled campaigning and prevent crowding amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe Court held that allowing political parties to put up hoardings would prevent piecemeal and sporadic hoardings and that there would be lesser chances of defacement of public and private property beyond redemption.\nAdditionally, the Court accepted the petitioner's reference to the legal position in Jharkhand stating \"no two standards can be applied in interpreting an Act or Rule in two different contiguous States\".\nTherefore, the petition was allowed.\nSenior Advocate S.D. Sanjay and Advocate-on-Record Raju Giri represented the petitioners, while Advocate Siddharth Prasad appeared for the Chief Electoral Officer.\nRead the Judgment:"}

It was contended that the size of the panel to represent the Central government is not fixed and that the government does not invite applications for appointment or renewal of the panel.\nNischal argued that the appointment of advocates as government counsel is contrary to the law laid down by the Supreme Court in State of Punjab v.

State of Kerala & Ors.].\nWhile doing so, single-judge Justice PV Kunhikrishnan made some observations regarding the importance of summer vacation for the well wellbeing of students. \n\"After a hectic academic year, the students need a break. That is why the summer vacation is given to the students. The students should enjoy the vacations and rejuvenate for their next academic year. Holiday breaks allow the students to shift their focus from traditional study materials. They can reach to their other ambitions in extracurricular activities, which they are generally not able to address during the school year,\" the judge said in his order.\nHe emphasised that children need to enjoy leisure time with their family and friends especially since a hectic academic year awaits them.\n\"Summer vacation is necessary to the students for spending time with their kith and kin and for a mental break. Concentrating on school books alone would not be sufficient for the children. Let them sing, let them dance, let them eat their favourite food leisurely without the fear of next day’s home work, let them enjoy their favourite television programmes. Let them play cricket, football or their favourite sports items and let them enjoy trips with their kith and kin. A hectic academic year is coming. Before that, a break is necessary for the student community. The students of 10th standard and Higher Secondary School definitely need a break before they enter their decisive academic year in their life,\" Justice Kunhikrishnan said. \nThe order was passed on a petition seeking an interim direction to the Regional Director of CBSE to give permission for conducting vacation classes in CBSE Schools.\nThe State's Director of General Education (DGE) had issued a circular objecting to vacation classes.\nThe Kerala CBSE School Management Association then moved the High Court against the circular.\nThe circular had cited prevalent weather conditions and also advocated enjoyment of vacation by the students, as grounds to argue against vacation classes.\nOn May 9, another single-judge had ordered a two-week interim stay on the circular and permitted vacation classes to continue.\nWhen the matter came up before Justice Kunhikrishnan on May 24, he noted that the previous interim order had relied on the 2018 judgment of the High Court in ISS (English Medium) Senior Secondary School, Perinthalmanna v. State of Kerala. \nIn it, the Court had observed that if there are no objections from parents, teachers and students, special classes can be conducted during the summer vacation on the condition that the school authorities will provide basic facilities. \nJustice Kunhikrishnan found that he could not agree with this decision. \nHe noted that Rule 1 Chapter VII of Kerala Education Rules says that all schools shall be closed for summer vacation every year on the last working day of March and reopened on the first working day of June unless otherwise notified by the Director. \nAs far as the present petition goes, the Court noted that there was no challenge to this Rule. \nMoreover, while considering a batch of similar petitions in 2019, a division bench of the Court had upheld the authority of the DGE to issue the kind of circular that was under question in the present petition. \n\"In such situation, I am of the considered opinion that the order passed by the DGE is the need of the hour. This Court need not invoke the powers under Article 226 of the Constitution of India to interdict an order passed by the DGE, which is in tune with Rule 1 of Chapter VII KER. Therefore, I am not in a position to agree with the dictum laid down in ISS (English Medium) Senior Secondary School's case (supra). It requires reconsideration.

{"ID": "id_728", "Summary": "The Madras High Court on Friday urged the State government to formulate a procedure for registration of 'Deed of Familial Association' which will give a stamp of approval to same-sex relationships and enhance the status of persons in such relationships in society.\nJustice N Anand Venkatesh said that such a provision could safeguard the rights of members of the LGBTQIA+ community and ensure that they are able to live without being disturbed or harassed.\nThe judge also noted that the right to choose to have and live in a relationship and the right to protection from harassment was recognised by the majority opinion of the Supreme Court in the Constitution Bench decision in Supriyo @ Supriya & Anr. v Union of India.\n\"In the considered view of this Court, the proposal that has been brought forth by the petitioner, prima facie sounds convincing. This is more so, since the apex court in the Supriyo's case, has categorically recognized the right of choice of two persons to have relationship. In view of the same, such persons must have protection to live in the society without being disturbed or harassed. For that purpose, the Deed of Familial Association will at least give some respect and status to such relationship,\" the Court said.\nJustice Venkatesh, therefore, directed the Social Welfare and Women Empowerment Department, which is already in the process of finalizing a policy for the LGBTQIA+ community, to consider a system for registering deeds of familial association.\n\"While undertaking this exercise, this suggestion/proposal given by the petitioner can be taken into consideration and the State can come up with a procedure for registration of such Deed of Familial Association and the scope of such a deed.

This suggestion given by this Court shall be kept in mind while finalizing the policy for LGBTQAI+ community,\" the order stated. \nThe order was passed on an intervening application moved in a case that originally began with a plea by a lesbian couple seeking protection from their relatives. Over the course of hearing the matter, the Court had issued several directions in an effort to further the welfare of LGBTQIA+ persons.\nThe intervenor in this instance sought a direction to the concerned authorities to issue suitable orders to recognize the deeds of familial association.\nAccording to the intervening petitioner, the purport of this deed is to ensure that two persons will have the right to live in a relationship. While continuing with that relationship, they will also have the right to protection. \nIt was also submitted that harassment of persons falling within the community is a daily affair which has to be countered through some means in the available legal framework. Therefore, if the parties enter into a contract in the form of a deed of familial association, whenever questions are asked or their safety is in danger, the deed could come to their aid. \nThe counsel told the Court that deed cannot go beyond its purpose or seek any further status in the light of the majority judgment of in Supriyo's case. \nIt was also brought to the notice of the Court that such a contract that is entered into between two individuals is not barred under the Indian Contract Law and hence, it was contended that this proposal that has been made by the petitioner can be taken into consideration by the government and a stamp of approval can be given. \nAccording to the petitioner, the deed of familial association will be confined to:\nharassment or violence or ill-treatment by society or even the biological families; and\ndiscrimination that can impact gainful employment, housing and assimilation in society.\nThe Court opined that the proposal of the petitioner was prima facie convincing and issued directions to the concerned authorities to take it into consideration while drafting a policy for the LGBTQIA+ community."}

{"ID": "id_730", "Summary": "The Bombay High Court recently clarified that under Protection Of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, half of life imprisonment would mean imprisonment for 10 years [Suresh Kashinath Kamble vs The State of Maharashtra].\nJustice Sarang V Kotwal held that since the term 'life imprisonment' is not defined under POCSO Act, it would have to be given meaning in consonance with its meaning in the Indian Penal Code (IPC).\n\"The wording ‘life imprisonment’ is not defined under POCSO Act. However, those words are used under IPC and, therefore, reference will have to be made to IPC provisions and they will have to be relied on,\" he held.\nSince as per Section 57 of IPC, for calculating fractions of terms of punishment, imprisonment for life shall be reck­oned as equivalent to imprisonment for twenty years, half of the same would amount to 10 years, the Court concluded. \nThe Court was dealing with an administrative order in a case in which it had imposed half of a life sentence on a POCSO convict. The superintendent of the concerned prison addressed a letter to the Court registry as he was unsure what half of life imprisonment would mean.\nAdvocate Drupad Patil, amicus curiae, stated that Section 2(2) of POCSO Act and Section 57 of IPC cover the issue completely and that the court had clarified the issue in the case of Chandrakant Vithal Pawar Vs. State of Maharashtra. \nSection 2(2) of POCSO Act states that the words not defined under the Act shall be assigned meaning from their definitions under the IPC, the Code of Criminal Procedure, the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, and the Information Technology Act.\nSection 57 of IPC provides that for calculating fractions of terms of punishment, imprisonment for life shall be reck­oned as equivalent to imprisonment for twenty years.\nAccording to Patil, these provisions and the judgment were clear and the superintendent had no reason to seek guidance from the Court in this regard. \nThe Court agreed and stated that Section 57 IPC leaves no doubt as to how sentence should be calculated when the accused is sentenced to suffer half of life imprisonment. \n\"It provides that in such case when the fractions of imprisonment for life is to be calculated then life imprisonment should be reckoned as equivalent to imprisonment for twenty years,\" it said.\nThus, the Court held that half of life imprisonment in the case would mean imprisonment for ten years."}

In a March 2021 order, the NGT also passed a slew of directions on such issues. \nOne such direction was to take an independent assessment of flow in all the drains reaching Yamuna within two months. Further, the NGT had also directed that an action plan to be submitted for setting up Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) within definite and monitorable timelines.\nAs such, in November 2021, the NGT declined to entertain the execution application filed by the appellant under Section 25 of the NGT Act. \nThe NGT opined that there was no case for taking recourse to its powers under Section 25, and added that the appellant could have sought the remedy provided under Section 26. Section 26 deals with the penalty for failure to comply with the orders of the NGT.\nHowever, the Supreme Court noted that the NGT had erred in its approach and opined that the Tribunal should have exercised its power to execute its orders under Section 25. The Supreme Court held:\n\"We are of the considered view that the observation of the Tribunal that there was no case for executing the earlier order under Section 25 is misconceived. The Tribunal is entrusted with the wholesome power to ensure that its orders are complied with. The absence of sewerage facilities is an important aspect which would merit the exercise of powers by the Tribunal under Section 25. The invocation of the power to levy a penalty under Section 26 will not necessarily sub-serve the purpose.\"\nTherefore, the Court allowed the appeal.

Times and again the judicial verdicts of the Apex Court and other Courts have shown their concern and anguish in such matters,\" the Court said. \nThe Court said that police force is a disciplined force enshrined with the pious duty of maintaining law and order and the accused's release may have an adverse effect on the trial.\nIn the present case, the Court said that there was nothing on record to show that the death of the person in custody was a natural death.\nThe Court was hearing a case of custodial violence which took place in 1997 in which the applicant, Sher Ali was one of the accused.\nOn March 2, 1997 one Om Prakash Gupta was allegedly arrested and taken into custody where he died allegedly after assault by the police personnel.\nThe police in order to conceal the same, conspired with the doctors of District Hospital, Shahdol and tabled the admission of Prakash in the hospital one hour prior to his death to show that the death had occurred in the hospital though Prakash had died at Police Station itself.\nThe son of the deceased sent a representation to the Senior Superintendent of Police by registered post but no action was taken. \nLater, a First Information Report (FIR) was registered on the basis of the complaint by the son for offences under Section 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 364 (kidnapping in order to murder) of Indian Penal Code. \nThe counsel for applicant submitted that he has been falsely implicated in the case and the death of Om Prakash was natural and even the doctors after the postmortem could not give any definite opinion about the cause of death. \nFurther it was submitted that FIR was based on totally false and frivolous allegations and there was no corroboration of the version of the prosecution that the deceased died a custodial death.\nOn the other hand, the Additional Government Advocate (AGA) opposed the bail and submitted that beating of the deceased in police custody was evident from the fact that he had received two contusions on his body and the site of the injuries are fleshy part of the body which could have happened only on assault.\nAfter examining the record and submissions, the Court said that it was a case of custodial violence and death was not natural. \n\"The deceased as per the postmortem report has received injuries on his body which are suggestive of assault on him by hard and blunt object. There is no finding in the postmortem examination report which would be suggestive of any heart problem or cardiac arrest/heart attack. There is nothing to show that the death was natural,\" the Court said. \nIt, therefore, said that bail cannot be given at this stage and referred to the fact that Supreme Court had on September 23, 2020, directed the trial court to proceed with the trial on a day-to-day basis and make an endeavour to conclude it within a period of one year.\nThe Court also adverted to the observations by the Supreme Court on custodial violence in the landmark case of DK Basu Vs. State of West Bengal.\n\"Custodial death is perhaps one of the worst crimes in a civilised society governed by the rule of law. The rights inherent in Articles 21 and 22(1) of the Constitution require to be jealously and scrupulously protected. We cannot wish away the problem. Any form of torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment would fall within the inhibition of Article 21 of the Constitution, whether it occurs during investigation, interrogation or otherwise,\" the Court quoted from DK Basu. \nThe bail plea of Sher Ali was, therefore, rejected."}

Section 14 of the Family Courts Act was introduced to “wither away the rigours of the Indian Evidence Act”, the High Court further noted.\n\"The legislature, while broadly mandating for application for CPC to proceedings before a Family Court, has vested discretion in favour of such Family Court to devise a procedure on its own ... the Family Court has been empowered to take any material into evidence which as per its opinion furthers the cause of effective adjudication of a matrimonial dispute ... Family Courts are not fully bound by provision of CPC,\" the High Court's order stated. \nThe Court made the observation while dismissing a husband's plea challenging an order passed by a family court, whereby his application raising objections to his estranged wife's affidavit of evidence was rejected.\nThe husband's counsel contended that the wife had sought to produce additional evidence in violation of the CPC and the Indian Evidence Act. \nThe Court, however, dismissed the husband's appeal, opining that the family court was not fully bound by the CPC or the Evidence Act. \n\"A family Court is well within its powers to take into evidence any material, which in the judicial discretion of such Family Court, may be essential for effectively adjudicating a lis before it whether or not such material fulfills the requirements of Indian Evidence Act, 1872. However, while exercising such discretion, the family court ought to bear in mind that receiving of such material by way of evidence does not violate the basic principles of our legal system\", the High Court said. \nThe Court also noted that the CPC provision cited by the husband's counsel, which concerns the filing of applications for permission to submit additional documents, was not a mandatory provision when it came to family court cases. \n\"Order VIII, Rule 1-A CPC of 1908 is not mandatory provision and rather it is a directive in nature only especially with respect to the proceedings under Family Court Act, 1908. A Family Court will be well within its judicial discretion to take into evidence any material in terms of sub-rule (3) of order VIII, Rule 1-A of CPC, 1908 without any formal application for grant of leave by the defendant. However, while exercising such discretion the Family Court is required to pass a reasoned order\", the Court held.\nThe High Court proceeded to uphold the family court's decision and dismiss the husband's appeal."}

Those judgments would not apply in the cases where for separate incident, may be involving in same cognizable offence, separate FIRs have been registered. The evidence in reference to each FIR would also be in reference to the individual case,\" the Court said. \nThe Court, therefore, dismissed a plea praying that after first FIR, every subsequent FIR should have been taken to be statement under Section 162 of Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) and police authorities should, therefore, not produce the petitioner for remand in each FIR. \nThe Court was hearing a matter wherein FIRs were registered against Noble Cooperative Bank Limited and other accused for allegedly cheating around 3 lakh persons to the tune of Rs. 4,000 crores.\nThe petitioner was the Chief Executive Officer of Noble Cooperative Bank Limited which operated the accounts of investor company Garvit Innovative Promoters Limited (GIPL). \nGIPL was incorporated to carry out business of rental of bikes. The company had taken investments from the public for purchase of bikes to be rented out.\nThe rental received out of it was to be paid to the investors. The investments made by various investors came into the bank account of GIPL which were in Noble Cooperative Bank.\nA request was then made by the GIPL to Noble Cooperative Bank to issue around 2,61,000 cheques for distribution of dividend and monthly rental to the investors.\nOn this note, it was submitted before the Court that these cheques were issued by the bank without the knowledge of the petitioner.\n\"There was no approval by him for printing of 2,61,000 cheques for its issuance. The allegations of fraud, if any, could have been made against GIPL and the officers of the Cooperative Bank for issuance of cheques without the knowledge and permission of the petitioner.\" the petitioner submitted. \nHundreds of FIRs were registered against the petitioner.\nPursuant to the same, the petitioner was produced for remand in reference to each FIR. The petitioner contended that after first FIR, every subsequent FIRs should have been taken to be statement under Section 162 CrPC.\nA prayer was, therefore, made to the Police authorities not to produce the petitioner for remand in each FIR; rather subsequent FIR be taken as statement under Section 162 CrPC.\nIn this regard, the following prayer was made:\n\"To direct the direct the Police authorities to treat Case Crime No. 385 of 2019 as the Main Case Crime and to merge all the other Case Crimes/FIRs registered in Bike-Bot matter at PS: Dadri and elsewhere in State of UP, as statements u/s 162 of the Cr.P.C. and to merge these subsequent FIRs in main Case Crime No. 385/2019.\"\nThe Court, however, noted that registration of a number of FIRs against the petitioner by different persons was in reference to their own transactions.\n\"It has been disclosed that 2,61,000 cheques were issued by the Noble Cooperative Bank Limited to various investors. It was involving huge amount. The issuance of the cheques by the bank is said to be on the instruction of the GIPL. The allegations further show transfer of the amount received from the investors leaving hardly any balance in the bank account of GIPL. The transfer of the entire amount was in the knowledge of the bank yet they issued around 2,61,000 cheques. The amount involved therein is not negligible but running in crores. The investors lodged first information report in reference to their own transaction,\" the Court noted. \nThe petitioner placed reliance on TT Antony judgment of the Supreme Court in this regard. \nThe High Court, however, noted that in TT Antony, the second FIR came out of the first FIR. \n\"The significance of the word “same incident” is relevant for the reason that FIRs are not out of same incident giving rise to one or more cognizable offences. It is out of separate transactions by different investors, therefore, the judgment of the Apex Court in the case of TT Antony would not be applicable to the facts of this case,\" the Court ruled. \nSimilarly, Amish Devgan's was a case where several FIRs in different States were registered pursuant to a television telecast wherein anchor Amish Devgan was said to have made objectionable comments. \n\"The broadcast was heard by many persons resulting in registration of several FIRs. The facts aforesaid show that FIRs therein were also out of the same incident,\" the Court said. \nSame was the case with Arnab Goswami judgment, the Court said. \nThe petition was, therefore, dismissed."}

{"ID": "id_756", "Summary": "“What is the procedure to be followed by a Court when a case record goes missing”, the Kerala High Court pondered on Monday, while hearing a petition seeking the recovery of a will misplaced by a District Court. (Safarulla v. Gracy Josephine Lambie)\nJustice CS Dias was faced with this question after certain petitioners approached the High Court aggrieved at the rejection of their application for a document in the custody of a District Court.\nThe Judge highlighted that the document’s loss should have been brought to the notice of the District Judge and a thorough search be undertaken thereafter. If needed, the High Court should be informed as well, Justice Dias states in his order.\nReturning the application for the document to the petitioners, only to state that the authority was not in a position to issue the certified copy of the document sought, was unsustainable and erroneous, especially as the document was in the custody of the Court, the Bench ruled.\nThe petitioner, in this case, is a co-owner of some property measuring 6.88 acres. The property originally belonged to one Andrew Rodger Lambie, who bequeathed the property in favour of his wife by an unregistered Will.\nAfter Lambie’s death, his wife filed a petition before a District Judge at Thalassery seeking a letter of administration. The will was annexed to the petition submitted to the court. Accordingly, the ownership of the property vested in the woman.\nSubsequently, the woman sold her property to some others who assigned it in favour of the petitioner's mother and other relatives. The property now vests in the petitioner and his siblings.\nDesiring to construct a building upon the property, the petitioner and his siblings approached a bank for financial aid. The bank, however, insisted upon a certified copy of Lambie’s Will.\nThe petitioner and his siblings approached the District Judge, submitting an application for a copy of the will. The Record Clerk at the Court returned the application with an endorsement, stating that the will could not be traced.\nIn proceedings before the High Court, the District Judge informed the High Court that the Record Clerk had undertaken a thorough search of the chest and almirah in the court, to no avail. Hence, the District Court was “not in a position to issue the certified copy of the Will”.\nThis particular reason was not specified in the endorsement on the application, the judge admitted in his communication to the High Court. \nThe search was undertaken because the application had stated that the record of the will was in a sealed cover with the Sheristadar, the judge additionally stated in his letter to the High Court.\nThe Court concluded that it was evident that the will was misplaced while in the keeping of the District Court, while it was in ‘custodia legis’.\nPointing out that it had last year issued a detailed communication to all Subordinate Courts to handle situations where important case records were misplaced by the courts, the Court pointed out that the Record Clerk had no authority to return the application.\nThe Record Clerk ought to have informed the District Judge about the missing document, after which a proper search should have been promptly ordered, Justice CS Dias emphasized.\nThereafter, if the document was still not found, the High Court was to be intimated and as a last resort, the reconstruction of records ordered, the Judge stated, relying on the High Court’s memorandum.\nOn these terms, the Court set aside the endorsement and the return of the petitioner’s application, declaring these to be erroneous and unsustainable in law.\nRead the Order:"}

{"ID": "id_758", "Summary": "Observing that just because she is an old lady she isn't entitled to get any relief, the Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court, last week refused to grant bail to a 63-year-old woman booked for aiding her 65-year-old husband to commit rape on a minor girl [Zubeeda vs Union Territory of J & K]\nSingle-judge Justice Sanjay Dhar observed that the accused is not entitled to relief merely because she is an old lady.\nThe Court noted that the 14-year-old victim was under the guardianship of the accused couple as her parents had sent her there to learn embroidery work from Zubeeda's husband.\n\"The material on record shows that the victim was sent by her father to the house of the petitioner to learn embroidery work. Thus, the victim was under guardianship of the petitioner and her husband. A bond of trust and confidence must have been reposed by the victim but the accused by indulging in abhorrent behavior with her, have shaken her trust and confidence and brought a bad name to the relationship of a child with her guardian who were as good as her parents,\" Justice Dhar observed.\nThe judge further noted that this isn't an ordinary case where the accused is a young person.\n\"It is not an ordinary offence where the perpetrator of the crime is a young boy but it is a case where the perpetrators of the crime happen to be the persons aged more than four times that of the age of the victim. The gap in the age of the accused and the victim makes their alleged act more heinous and it shows an element of perversion in the offence alleged. The position of the petitioner qua the victim makes the offence all the more heinous. Thus, merely because the petitioner happens to be a woman does not entitle her to concession of bail in these circumstances,\" the judge added.\nAs per the First Information Report (FIR) lodged by the victim's parents, they had sent her to the accused couple's house to learn embroidery. The victim lived for a week with them and during this time, the accused raped her twice.\nThe victim testified even before the trial court that the petitioner Zubeeda had sprinkled some liquid on her face, which made her unconscious and after she gained sense, she found herself lying naked. She further stated that Zubeeda used to make her sleep between her and her husband.\nThe judge further noted from the FIR that the issue came to light after the victim returned to her parents and the accused called her saying he would take care of abortion charges if she gets pregnant. He had even offered to pay ₹4,000 to Rs 5,000 to the victim's father for not reporting the case to the police.\nIn its orders passed on May 21, the bench noted that Zubeeda is involved in commission of offence under Section 376/109 Indian Penal Code read with Sections 4 and 17 of the POCSO Act.\n\"Abetment of an offence carries the same punishment as is provided for that offence. Section 376(3) IPC provides punishment in a case where rape has been committed upon a woman under 16 years of age. As per this provision, the punishment provided for such offence is not less than 20 years, which may extend to imprisonment for life. Thus, the offences for which the petitioner is facing trial are serious in nature,\" the bench noted.\nThe judge further noted that the trial in the case has just commenced and that only the victim's statement has been recorded so far while most prosecution witnesses including her parents are yet to be examined.\n\"The statements of other prosecution witnesses including the father and three more relatives of the prosecutrix are yet to be recorded. If the petitioner is admitted to bail at this stage, there is every apprehension that the prosecution witnesses, who happen to be the close relatives of the victim, would be influenced by the petitioner,\" the judge said in the order.\nThe Court said that in the cases involving offences of serious nature falling under IPC or POCSO Act, where the victim happens to be a minor child, the Court has to be alive to the need for protecting the victims and the witnesses and it is duty of the Court to ensure that victim and witnesses, in such serious matters, are made to feel secure while deposing before the Court. \n\"This can be ensured only if the statements of the victim and the material witnesses are recorded while keeping the accused behind the bars,\" the single-judge stated.\nThe judge, therefore, rejected the bail application.\nSenior Advocate BA Bashir and advocate Falak Bashir appeared for the bail applicant.\nGovernment Advocate Sajad Ashraf represented the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir."}

[In Re Subhash Kumar Advocate]\nJustices Saumitra Dayal Singh and Rajendra Kumar-IV were dealing with a matter wherein a lawyer had appeared for his father in a matrimonial dispute against his mother. Surprised by this aspect of the matter, the Court observed,\n\"It cannot be for Courts to advise lawyers to choose their clients. It has always been left to the wisdom of the learned members of the bar. The basic learning that any member of the bar imbibes at the initial years of practice tell him to not appear for his blood relatives.

Yet, the father - son duo before us would appear to take no less. That's the tragic part of this case,\" the Court said. \nPertinently, the Court was dealing with a contempt case concerning the lawyer and his father (his client). The lawyer and his father were alleged to have disrupted proceedings before a family court. After the family court judge sent a written complaint over the incident to the High Court, contempt proceedings were initiated against the lawyer and his father. \nThe High Court observed that court proceedings are formal proceedings which must be conducted in a dignified manner and without disruptions. Any grievance has to be addressed only by filing an appropriate application, appeal or a mention, the Court added.\nHowever, these commonly enforced practices may take a back seat in an emotionally charged atmosphere, such as when a lawyer is appearing for his relative, the Court observed.\n“What more catastrophic or precipitative ingredient could have existed than a son (lawyer) appearing for his father (litigant) that too in a matrimonial case with his (lawyer's) mother!” the High Court added while referring to the case at hand.\nThe contempt case was initiated on a the reference made by the Additional Principal Judge, Family Court at Aligarh in 2022. \nOne reference was against a litigant, Subhash Kumar and the other was against his son and his lawyer, Shubham Kumar. Both were accused of behaving in an unruly matter in the family court, despite warnings. \nThe lawyer is also alleged to have shouted that \"he is a practitioner of the Allahabad High Court and that he knowns how to deal with petty courts,\" while threatening to lodge a complaint against the Presiding Officer.\nThe High Court took a dim view of the allegations and also raised doubts over the sincerity of the apology tendered by the lawyer and his father.\n\"On a query made, if the contemnors were seeking forgiveness. Both, first stated 'Yes'. However, when questioned for what, the answer was ridiculous to say the least as they both stated 'जो हमने करा नहीं (for what we did not do)'\", the Court observed. \nNevertheless, the Court decided to close the contempt proceedings to avoid wasting time meant for genuine litigants. \n\"We do not have time to take our gaze away from the cause of justice and to devote the same to punish the contemnors as per the rules of law. Our time would be better utilized and is needed to address the cry for justice by genuine litigants. It does not merit to be wasted on the jesters and/or deviant lawyer and litigant that these contemnors are. They are far too less deserving of that,\" the Court said.\nThe bench observed that it is not for the Court to force a litigant or his lawyer to tender an apology. The Court, however, added that it has not absolved either the lawyer or his father for their conduct.\nThe Court also appreciated the family court judge for doing all she could to ensure that the decorum of the court was maintained before parting with the matter."}

The victim was also said to have stated she cannot live without him, the Court noted.\n“This contradicts the prosecution’s version that when the deceased refused to leave the petitioner, he killed her,” the bench said.\nAccording to the case details, the police on May 10 in 2016 received information from the accused that he was going to die by suicide and that the woman who was with him had shot herself. \nThe police later found the accused on the driver’s seat in a car and the victim dead in the passenger's seat.\nThe investigation revealed that the victim and accused were in a relationship for several years. The victim-woman was married and had children; the accused was also married to another woman. The prosecution alleged he killed her after she refused to leave him.\nAfter hearing the submissions and looking into the evidence, the Court accepted the contention that the accused and victim were in a cordial relationship and that their families were known to each other. \nThe Court, however, rejected the prosecution’s theory that the victim and her husband had advanced some money to the accused which he was not returning.

Custodial interrogation of applicant / accused is required to be carried out to unearth the entire conspiracy hatched between him and a number of co-accused persons.\"\nAs per the prosecution case, Navneet Kalra, along with other co-accused, \"hatched a conspiracy\" to wrongfully make money by \"inducing\" the public to buy his oxygen concentrators at an \"exorbitant rate\" amid a raging pandemic.\nDelhi Police opposed Kalra'a anticipatory bail on the ground that the investigation was at a very early stage and that Kalra's custodial interrogation was imperative to further unearth his relationship with other parties.\nIt was argued that no anticipatory bail could be granted to \"influential persons\" who have the potential to tamper with evidence. \nThe prosecution contended that Kalra had made \"crores of rupees\" by inducing the needy public to believe that his oxygen concentrators were \"premium\", \"German\" and \"sufficient for two persons\".\nRelying on a report from Sri Ram laboratory, the prosecution asserted that the sample oxygen concentrator had come out as having \"poor quality\" and were \"not working\".\nKalra, on the other hand, claimed that he was being \"framed\" based on content on social media and was made a scapegoat to divert attention from more pressing issues. \nIt was submitted that the oxygen concentrators seized from his restaurants were authenticated and properly imported, and were sold after raising invoices. \nOn the allegations that the concentrators were being sold at exorbitant prices, Kalra highlighted that the government authorities itself had not fixed a ceiling price for the machines.\nThe Court opined that there was prima facie incriminating evidence on record against Navneet Kalra to the effect that contrary to the brochure, the concentrators being sold by him were not manufactured with \"German collaboration\" and were manufactured in China. \nConsidering the lab reports, the Court added that the average output in terms of Oxygen purity of two samples was found to be 32.7 % & 38.2 % and with the laboratory room air, the Oxygen concentration was found to be merely 20.8 %.\nWith regards the allegations of price manipulation by Kalra, the Court noted, \n\"As per statement of one aggrieved, the applicant/accused had firstly quoted the price of Oxygen concentrator as Rs. 49,999/- and on the next day, he forced him to pay Rs. 55,000/- owing to his urgent requirement.. The applicant/accused is reported to have collected advance payments from several needy persons for supply of Oxygen concentrators and he kept on postponing the delivery on the pretext of shipment being held-up. He kept on increasing the price of the same and eventually, he neither supplied the product to several persons, nor refunded their advance amounts.\"\nThe anticipatory bail was accordingly rejected. \nSenior Advocate Vikas Pahwa with Advocate Vineet Malhotra appeared for Kalra.

{"ID": "id_765", "Summary": "The Bombay High Court recently quashed the death sentence of a man convicted of killing and raping a teenager on the ground that the accusation of murder could not be proven [Ashok Baban Mukane vs The State of Maharashtra]\nA Bench of Justices Sadhana Jadhav and Prithwiraj Chavan while hearing a confirmation plea of a death sentence along with an appeal against the same sentence, ruled that while the accusation of rape was proven beyond all reasonable doubts, the prosecution failed to establish the charge of murder. \nAs a result, it held that the case does not meet the criterion of the rarest of rare cases, as held by the sessions court.\nThe Court, therefore, set aside the death sentence but upheld the sentence of life imprisonment handed down by the trial court for rape.\nThe incident occurred on September 5, 2013, as the victim was returning home. According to the prosecution, she was walking along the railway lines when the accused approached her and raped her. After she resisted him, he supposedly killed her by hitting her on the head with a blunt object.\nThe Additional Sessions Judge convicted him for murder and rape and sentenced him to death for the offence of murder and life imprisonment for the offence of rape.\nThis led to the present appeal before the High Court. \nAfter being convinced that the deceased was murdered and raped, the court reasoned that, because the murder weapon could not be retrieved and there were no signs of resistance on the accused, the two offences may have been perpetrated by different individuals.\n“There is every possibility of committing rape upon the victim when either she was unconscious or there is every possibility of she being brutally assaulted by someone else before she was subjected to rape by the appellant,” Justice Chavan’s judgement read.\nThe Court determined that there was no clear evidence presented by the prosecution to show that the appellant was the one who inflicted injuries on the victim, such as suffocation, neck compression, or striking her on the head with a hard and blunt item.\nThe bench held that the sessions court erred in convicting the accused of the offence of murder in the absence of convincing and satisfactory evidence on record. \n“No doubt, in normal circumstances, one may be compelled to think or presume that due to resistance from the victim while attempting to commit rape, the appellant might have smothered her face with a bag or throttled her neck resulting into her death. However, as already stated, in the absence of any marks or bruises or abrasions on the person of the appellant, it is difficult to reach such conclusion. Moreover, the Investigating Officer had failed to produce hard and blunt object alleged to have been used in giving blows over the head of the victim,” the Court noted.\nThe Court further remarked that if the bag had been used to smother the victim, there would have been some evidence in the form of saliva or other liquid sticking to it, and thus disregarded the idea of the appellant smothering her.\nIt, therefore, concluded that the prosecution failed to establish any nexus between the death of the victim and the appellant and therefore, set aside the appellant's conviction of the offence of murder under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code. \nThe conviction for rape under section 376(1) of the IPC was maintained and the convict was directed to serve the sentence for the same.\nThe District Legal Services Authority, Thane, was ordered to pay ₹5 lakh in compensation to the victim's mother within six months, and the plea was dismissed.\nAdvocate Shashikant Chaudhari along with advocates Snehal S. Chaudhari, Pranot Pawar and Gyanprakash R. Pal appeared for the appelant. APP Veera Shinde appeared for the State."}

{"ID": "id_770", "Summary": "The State is not doing charity by paying compensation to citizens who are entitled to such payment when their land is acquired by the government, the Supreme Court recently observed [Sudha Bhalla and ors vs Rakesh Kumar Singh and ors].\nThe Court made it clear that the State and its instrumentalities cannot project that they are being gracious in compensating such landowners.\nA bench of Justices BR Gavai and Sandeep Mehta added that the right to property under Article 300-A of the Constitution is still a constitutional right.\n\"Depriving a citizen of his Constitutional Right to use the land for 20 years and then showing graciousness by paying the compensation and beating drums that the State has been gracious, in our view, is unacceptable. The State is not doing charity by paying compensation to the citizen for acquisition of land,\" the Court said. \nThe Court was dealing with a contempt case initiated against officials of the Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) who had failed to adequately compensate certain landowners whose land was acquired by the authority in 2004.\nThe top court noted that a compensation award was passed in December 2023 only after the issue of contempt notices to the GDA.\nThe Court dismissed the contention that the GDA has now provided the sought by the landowners. Among other observations, the Court noted that the GDA had taken seven long years to conclude that the land acquired was not residential land but agricultural land.\nAn argument on behalf of the GDA that the delay has worked out well for the landowners since they would now get a \"handsome amount\" as compensation under the 2013 Land Acquisition Act, instead of a lesser amount under the earlier 1956 land acquisition law also failed to impress the Court. \n\"This argument on behalf of the State or its instrumentalities after holding the land of a citizen for a period of 20 years and then taking a plea that the land owners are getting benefited, is something unpalatable,\" the Court said. \nHowever, it closed the contempt of court proceedings after finding it plausible that there may have been miscommunications between the GDA and the lawyers who represented the authority in Court. \nThe Court concluded that there was no wilful disobedience of the court's orders by the GDA and disposed of the contempt case. \nHowever, the Court clarified that it has not decided on the validity of the compensation award and that the landowners were still free to challenge the same if required. \nAny such challenge should be decided on within six months, the Court added. \n\"If the GDA or its officers make an attempt to prolong the proceedings, the Court or the authorities would be free to draw an adverse inference and decide the proceedings within the aforesaid period,\" the Court further observed. \nSenior Advocate Dama Seshadri Naidu briefed by a team from Vachher and Agrud appeared for the land-owners.\nSenior Advocates Mukul Rohatgi, Siddharth Luthra, and Ravindra Kumar appeared for the alleged contemnors (officials of the GDA).\nSolicitor General Tushar Mehta appeared for the Ghaziabad Development Authority."}

{"ID": "id_775", "Summary": "The Nagpur bench of the Bombay High Court on Thursday upheld the life sentence of a 55-year-old man, who raped a minor girl and impregnated her and later abandoned her at a hospital when she was in labour [Harishchandra Sitaram Khanorkar vs State of Maharashtra].\nBesides the girl's testimony, the bench also found the scientific evidence in the form of DNA reports credible and establishing the guilt of the appellant.\nIn this regard, a division bench of Justices Rohit Deo and Urmila Joshi-Phalke said that DNA testing has the capability to not only exonerate the wrongly convicted but also to identify the guilty.\n\"The DNA testing has an unparalleled ability both to exonerate the wrongly convicted and to identify the guilty. It has the potential to significantly improve both the criminal justice system and police investigative practices,\" the Court said.\nThe Court rejected the contention of the convict that he had given shelter to the victim, looked after her and even got her admitted to a good school after her father died and mother had entered into a second marriage.\n\"The trust of the victim is betrayed by the accused. The accused was under moral obligation to protect the child in the background that he was having his own daughter but he destroyed her future life. He had destroyed her physical body and degraded the very soul of helpless girl. He has violated her privacy and personal integrity and also caused serious psychological as well as physical harm to her,\" the bench observed in the order.\nIt further said that rape is not merely physical assault but it often destructs the whole personality of the victim, and therefore, matters of such allegation must be dealt with utmost sensitivity.\nThe appellant was arrested after the victim's mother lodged a complaint against him on December 2, 2013 alleging that he had raped her minor daughter on several occasions and impregnated her. The mother claimed that the victim in question was her daughter from her first marriage. \nHowever, after her husband died, she performed a second marriage and left the victim at the appellant's house. \nThe appellant, the victim alleged had raped her first time when she was in class 9 and it happened repeatedly. This came to light when she told her mother about the continuous abdominal pain, which on medical examination was found to be a seven-month pregnancy.\nWhen the girl was to deliver a child and was in labour pain, the appellant had rushed her to a hospital in an inebriated condition and left her while she was in agony.\nThe trial court convicted him for rape under Section 376 of Indian Penal Code and sentenced him to life imprisonment along with fine of ₹25,000. \nThe convict then moved the High Court by way of the present appeal challenging the same. \nThe High Court held that the evidence of the victim was trustworthy and nailed the appellant.\n\"Children are the greatest gift of humanity and the sexual assault on children is the most heinous crime,\" the bench observed.\nBesides the girl's testimony, the bench also found the DNA reports credible. \nSpeaking about the sentencing in such cases, the bench underscored that a civil society has a ‘fundamental’ and ‘human’ right to live free from any kind of fear, threat, danger or insecurity at the hands of anti-social elements and that the society legitimately expects courts to apply doctrine of proportionality and impose suitable and deterrent punishment that commensurate with the gravity of the offence.\nWith these observations, the bench dismissed the appeal.\nAdvocates AS Dhore, Sheikh Sohailuddin and Yash Bangale appeared for the Appellant. \nAdditional Public Prosecutor MJ Khan represented the State."}
{"ID": "id_776", "Summary": "A division bench of Telangana High Court recently directed the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) to watch the Telugu movie ‘Vyuham’ and take a decision with regard to its certification on or before February 9 [P Ram Gopal Varma vs Telugu Desam Party]. \nA single-judge had earlier set aside the censor certificate issued to the movie in December 2023 after Telugu Desam Party (TDP) moved the Court alleging that the movie was defamatory to the party and its leaders.\nJustice Surepalli Nanda had also directed the CBFC to reconsider its decision in accordance with the law within a period of three weeks. \nThe judgment of the single-judge was challenged by the movie director P Ram Gopal Varma and producer Ramadhutha Creations before a division bench.\nThe division bench of Chief Justice Alok Aradhe And Justice Anil Kumar Jukanti agreed with the reasoning of the single-judge in setting aside the censor certificate. However, it modified the order by directing an expeditious decision on film certification.\nThe Court reasoned that the producer has a fundamental right under Article 19 of the Constitution of India to allude to true incidents with his perspective.\nIt also said that the producer has invested money for producing the film and is required to book the theatres in advance to ensure the release of the movie.  \n“It is directed that the Chairman shall re-constitute the Revising Committee, if not already constituted, and the Revising Committee shall view the movie and duly communicate its decision for certification of the film to the appellants on or before 09.02.2024,” ordered the Court.\nIn the appeal against the single-judge’s judgment, it was argued that a political party cannot maintain a writ petition, much less a petition for alleged defamation. \nIt was also contended that Form VIII in the Cinematograph (Certification) Rules, 1983 does not require the Revising Committee to record reasons for grant of ‘U’ certificate to a movie.\nConsidering the submissions, the Court at the outset observed that artistic freedom is a fundamental right. \n“The freedom of creation by artistic means is a fundamental right and is covered under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution of India. However, the same can be regulated. The Cinematograph Act, 1952 is an Act to make provision for the certification of cinematograph films for exhibition and for regulating exhibitions by means of cinematographs.”\nOn whether TDP could have filed a writ petition, the Court held the political party to be an aggrieved person and opined that it cannot be said to be a stranger having no right.\nThe Court rejected the argument that the Revising Committee of CBFC was not required to assign any reasons while granting ‘U’ certificate to a film with excisions. \n“On perusal of Rule 24(9) of the Certification Rules, it is evident that each member of the Revising Committee before leaving the preview theatre [has to] record his recommendations in writing in Form VIII set out in Second Schedule spelling out in clear terms the reasons therefor…,” said the Court.\nThus, the Court agreed with the conclusions of the single-judge. However, it directed an expeditious decision on the film certification. \nSenior Counsel A Venkatesh and advocates Pasham Mohith and Rajagopallavan Tayi represented the appellants.\nSenior Counsel Unnam Muralidhar represented the Telugu Desam Party.\nDeputy Solicitor General Gadi Praveen Kumar appeared for the Union of India and CBFC."}
{"ID": "id_777", "Summary": "The Kerala High Court, in an order declining a decree of divorce, lamented the casual and selfish manner in which the younger generation treats marital relationships [Libin Varghese v. Rajani Anna Mathew].\nA Division Bench of Justices A Muhamed Mustaque and Sophy Thomas opined that the increasing instances of divorce - effected by extra-marital affairs - may be the result of a rise in consumer culture, and that live-in relationships are on the rise.\n\"Now-a-days, the younger generation think that marriage is an evil that could be avoided to enjoy free life without any liabilities or obligations. They would expand the word ‘WIFE’ as ‘Worry Invited For Ever’ substituting the old concept of ‘Wise Investment For Ever’. The consumer culture of ‘use and throw’ seems to have influenced our matrimonial relationships also. Live-in-relationships are on the rise, just to say good-bye when they fell apart,\" the Court said in its judgment.\nThe Bench further opined that the destruction of once solemn marital ties would affect society as a whole.\n\"Kerala, known as God’s own Country, was once famous for its well knit family bondage. But the present trend it seems to break the nuptial tie on flimsy or selfish reasons, or for extra-marital relationships, even unmindful of their children. The wails and screams coming out of disturbed and destroyed families are liable to shake the conscience of the society as a whole. When warring couples, deserted children and desperate divorcees occupy the majority of our population, no doubt it will adversely affect the tranquility of our social life, and our society will have a stunted growth\" the judgment stated.\nIn the judgment authored by Justice Thomas, the Court recalled that marriage once was once considered as solemn and was the foundation of strong family units and in turn, a strong society.\nIn this regard, the judgment quoted Confucius:\n“Marriage is the union of two different surnames, in friendship and in love, in order to continue the posterity of the former sages, and to furnish those who shall preside at, the sacrifices to, heaven and earth, at those in the ancestral temple, and at those at the altars to the spirits of the land and grain.”\nPertinently, the Court held that parties to a marriage cannot walk away from each other by seeking the assistance of a court of law to obtain a decree of divorce and then go on to legalise their extra-marital relationships.\n\"Courts cannot come to the aid of an erring person to legalise his activities, which are per se illegal. If the husband having unholy alliance with another woman wants to avoid his lawfully wedded wife and his three little children, he cannot seek the assistance of a court of law to get his present relationship legalised by dissolving his lawful marriage, without any valid reasons for the same,\" the judgment stated.\nThe Court was considering an appeal moved by a man against the order of a family court which dismissed his divorce petition under Section 10(1)(x) of the Divorce Act, 1869.\nThe case of the appellant husband is that he got married to the respondent-wife in 2009 and had three girl children together. But later, his wife allegedly developed some behavioral issues and kept picking quarrels with him for no reason, alleging an illicit relationship with another woman. She failed to perform her marital duties and was physically and mentally abusive towards him, he claimed.\nThe respondent-wife opposed these claims and said that the husband was concocting reasons so that he can leave her and their children and pursue the extra-marital affair that had commenced some time around 2017. She claimed that the husband's own mother and close relatives were aware of the extra-marital affair.\nFrom the testimonies of some witnesses, the Court found that the wife's claim seemed to be true. It also noted that the husband had no hesitation to question the chastity of his own aged mother, as she was supporting the respondent.\nIt also opined that the wife's reaction to the affair was normal human conduct and would not establish a case of behavioural abnormality or cruelty on her part.\n\"When the wife had reasonable grounds to suspect the chastity or fidelity of her husband, and if she questions him, or expresses her deep pain and sorrow before him, it cannot be termed as a behavioural abnormality, as it is the natural human conduct of a normal wife. The normal human reactions or responses from a wife, on knowing that her husband was having illicit connection with another lady, cannot be termed as behavioural abnormality or cruelty on the part of the wife, so as to dissolve their marriage\", the Court said.\nThe Court stated that mere quarrels, ordinary wear and tear of matrimonial relationships or casual outbursts of emotional feelings cannot be treated as cruelty warranting a divorce. \nSince the wife was still willing to reunite with the husband and since no act of cruelty that would cause the appellant to apprehend that continuing in the marriage would be harmful to the appellant was established by him, the Court held that he is not entitled to get a decree of divorce on the ground of matrimonial cruelty.\n\"If the appellant is ready to come back to his wife and children, they are ready to accept him, and there is nothing to show that the chances of an amicable reunion is foreclosed forever. So the finding of the Family Court, Alappuzha, that the appellant is not entitled for a decree of divorce on the ground of matrimonial cruelties is liable to be upheld\", the judgment stated."}
{"ID": "id_778", "Summary": "The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) on Wednesday upheld the ₹1,337.76 crore fine imposed by the Competition Commission of India (CCI) on Google for abuse of its dominant position in the Android market.\nHowever, in a major relief for the tech giant, the Bench of NCLAT Chairperson Justice Ashok Bhushan and Dr Alok Srivastava, Member (Technical), set aside four key directions issued by the CCI.\nThe Court aside the directions issued in paragraphs 617.3, 617.9, 617.10, and 617.7 of the CCI order. \nHere is a brief summary of what these directions stated: \nParagraph 617.3 -- Google shall not deny access to its play services Application Programming Interface (APIs) to disdvantage Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), app developers and its existing or potential competitors.\nParagraph 617.7 -- Google shall not restrict uninstalling of its pre-installed apps by the users.\nParagraph 617.9 -- Google shall allow the developers of app stores to distribute their app stores through Google Play Store.\nParagraph 617.10 -- Google shall not restrict the ability of app developers in any manner to distribute their apps through side-loading.\nIn a detailed order, the Appellate Tribunal found that the investigation conducted by CCI into Google's conduct was not in violation of principles of natural justice. \nThe order also held that the pre-installation of entire Google Mobile Services (GMS) on Android phones does amount to unfair use. \n\"The Appellant by making pre-installation of GMS suite conditional to signing of AFA/ACC for all Android devices manufacturers, has reduced the ability and incentive of devices manufacturers to develop and sell self-device operating or alternative version of Android and Android Forks and thereby limited technical and scientific development, which is breach of provisions of Section 4(2)(b)(ii) of the Act,\" the Tribunal held. \nNCLAT had reserved its orders in the matter on March 20. The Appellate Tribunal had earlier refused to grant any interim relief to Google. The matter then travelled to the Supreme Court, which also denied relief to the company. However, the apex court requested the NCLAT to decide the matter by March 31.\nIn addition to the penalty, the CCI also directed Google to cease and desist from participating in anti-competitive practices and directed it to modify its conduct within a defined timeline. The Commission had found:\nMandatory pre-installation of the entire Google Mobile Suite with no option to un-install the same amounts to imposition of unfair condition on the device manufacturers;\nGoogle used its dominant position in the online search market resulting in denial of market access for competing search apps;\nGoogle leveraged its dominant position in the app store market for Android OS to protect its position in online general search;\nGoogle leveraged its dominant position in the app store market for Android OS to enter as well as protect its position in online video hosting platform (OVHP) market through YouTube;\nGoogle, by making pre-installation of Google’s proprietary apps (particularly Google Play Store) reduced the ability and incentive of device manufacturers to develop and sell devices operating on alternative versions of Android.\nThe Commission thus issued the following directions to Google which could aid in modifying its conduct:\nOEMs should not be forced to pre-install a bouquet of applications, and and shall not be restrained from deciding the placement of pre-installed apps, on their smart devices;\nLicensing of Play Store to OEMs shall not be linked with the requirement of pre-installing Google search services, Chrome, YouTube, Google Maps, Gmail or any other app;\nGoogle shall not offer any monetary or other incentives to OEMs for ensuring exclusivity for its search services;\nGoogle shall not incentivise or obligate OEMs for not selling smart devices based on Android forks.\nGoogle shall not restrict uninstalling of its pre-installed apps by the users;\nGoogle shall allow users, during the initial device setup, to choose their default search engine for all search entry points. Users should have the flexibility to easily set as well as easily change the default settings.\nBelow is a brief summary of arguments made before the NCLAT.\nArguments for Google LLC\nSenior Advocate Arun Kathpalia appeared for Google LLC and argued that CCI's order suffers from confirmation bias and is based on a similar order of the European Commission (EC) in 2018.\nIt was stated that the company's agreements do not prevent equipment manufacturers from pre-installing competing apps with similar functionality.\nKathpalia refuted the CCI finding that Google reduced the ability and incentive for manufacturers to develop and sell devices operating on alternative versions of Android by making pre-installation of Google's apps mandatory.\nHe further said mere dominance in a market does not mean abuse of dominance, and the reason Google is popular among users is because of its effectiveness. Google is the most searched term on Bing, the search engine owned by Microsoft, Kathpalia said.\nArguments for CCI\nAdditional Solicitor General (ASG) N Venkataraman presented the CCI's case before the NCLAT.\nHe said that Google's policies in India can be summed up in five phrases: digital feudalism, digital slavery, technological captivity, chokepoint capitalism and consumer exploitation.\nHe argued that the companies that did not sign Google's contracts have gone extinct.

[Jai Govind v State]\nThe youth in this country are under the influence of the social media, movies, TV serials and web series and often land in the company of the wrong persons, the Court said. \nAs a result, cases involving allegations of rape on false promises of marriage, instigation to commit suicide, murder or culpable homicide, and false implication for differences arising during the relationship are on the rise, the judge said. \nJustice Siddharth made these observations while granting bail to a man accused of abetting the suicide of a woman, who the judge observed had “hopped from one affair to another with a number of boys” before she died by suicide in frustration when her family opposed these relationships or because of her incompatibility with the boys she befriended.\n\"This is one of the many cases coming to the court where the youth in this country are spoiling their lives due to lure of free relationship with the member of the opposite sex aping western culture and not finding any real soulmate in the end,\" the Court observed.\nIndian society is in the state of confusion on whether to permit their young children to adopt the western norms or to keep them firmly within the bounds of Indian culture, the Court added.\nIndian families continue to struggle with accepting their children's choice of life partners, often stumbling over issues of caste, religion, and financial status, the Court proceeded to observe. \nThis leads to various outcomes, such as their children eloping to marry their chosen partners, instances of suicide, or hasty engagements in an attempt to fill the emotional void left by previous unsuccessful relationships, the Court said. \n\"The young generation, unaware of the consequences of following the western culture is entering into the relationships being aired on the social media, movies etc., and thereafter ,after denial of social recognition to their choice of partner they become disillusioned and behave, sometimes against the society, sometimes against their parents and sometimes also against the partner of their choice when they do not find any way out from the predicament wherein they get landed after entering into such relationship,\" the Court further said.\nSocial media and movies show multiple affairs and infidelity to the spouse to be normal, the Court noted.  \n“This inflames the imagination of impressionable minds and they start experimenting with the same but they do fit (sic) in the prevailing societal norm,” the Court said.\nIn the present case, the bail applicant and the deceased woman were involved in a love affair.\nThe prosecution claimed that the applicant, along with others co-accused in the case, had kidnapped and raped the victim for days before she was abandoned in a market. Following the incident, the victim was stated to have committed suicide by ingesting mosquito repellent.\nThe applicant denied these allegations. His counsel argued that after the deceased woman was in a close relationship with another man before she passed away, and that a complaint was not registered against this man because of his close relation with a sitting member of the legislative assembly (MLA).\nWhile considering the rival submissions, the Court noted that this appeared to be a case where the deceased woman initially had a relationship with the bail applicant, before she developed a relationship with another boy. \nThe bench added that the woman may have died by suicide out of frustration, after she was unable to find a clear path between the two relationships. \nThe Court ultimately allowed the applicant's release on bail and directed the lower court to expedite the trial and preferably conclude it within two years.\nThe bail applicant was represented by advocates Vineet Vikram and Imran Ullah, while State was represented by advocate Vipin Kumar."}

In this light, the authorities had erred in alleging that the gameplay facilitated by the petitioner was taxable at 28 per cent.\nThe petition also pointed out that the Respondents' entire case was built on the erroneous surmise that the activities undertaken by Gameskraft were an actionable claim and not a service.\nIn this regard, it was submitted that if interim relief was not granted to the petitioner, it would cause irreparable loss of goodwill and reputation. Therefore, the show-cause notice was sought to be stayed.\nThe issue stemmed from a raid conducted by the GST authorities on Gameskraft's office in November 2021, which culminated in an order by which all the company's bank accounts were attached.\nPertinently, the quantum of amount alleged to be evaded by Gameskraft was at first marked at ₹419 crore.

{"ID": "id_788", "Summary": "The Supreme Court recently dismissed a plea by a lawyer seeking allotment of her late father's chamber in the Supreme Court premises. [Anamika Dewan v Registrar, Supreme Court of India and Ors.]\nJustices Hrishikesh Roy and Prashant Kumar Mishra noted that the petitioner was not a practicing lawyer on the day of her father's demise and was therefore, disentitled to favorable consideration under the allotment Rules.\nThe plea was moved by advocate Anamika Dewan. Her father, Balraj Dewan, was an Advocate-on-Record (AoR) in the Supreme Court and was allotted a chamber in 2006-2007. He passed away in June 2021 and his daughter enrolled as a lawyer about two years later in July 2023.\nWhen the petitioner's representation to the competent authority for allotment of her late father's chamber was not favourably considered, she moved the apex court.\nRule 7B of Lawyers’ Chambers (Allotment and Occupancy) Rules provides that in case of death of an allottee of a chamber, the children of the allottee may be allotted a portion of the chamber if the Allotment Committee is satisfied that the person is practicing in the Supreme Court. \nThere is also a provision to allot only one-half of the chamber to the surviving child/spouse.\nSenior Advocate Meenakshi Arora, appearing for the petitioner, stated that on the day the petitioner applied for the allotment of the chamber, she had become a lawyer.\nShe underlined that in January 2023, the Court had directed facilitation of the petitioner to make a representation to the Allotment Committee. \nArora argued that since the petitioner had made a fresh representation which was considered on a date when she had already become a lawyer, the allotment could be made sympathetically based on Rule 7B.\nThe Court stated that under Rule 7B, the right of consideration accrues on the death of the allottee and that the date of death could not be shifted based on the date of consideration of the application for allotment.\n\"There could be cases when the committee may not be able to consider an application immediately on death. There could also be a situation of the application being kept pending for one reason or the other,\" the Court emphasized.\nTherefore, the Court concluded that if the date of consideration of application or the date of qualification of the applicant is taken into consideration, the operation of Rule 7B would be inconsistent and will generate varying results. \n\"In our understanding, the right for consideration under Rule 7B accrues on the date of death of the allottee. This will avoid any inconsistency in the manner of consideration,\" the Court explained.\nTherefore, the Court concluded that on the day of the death of her father, the petitioner was not a Supreme Court lawyer and therefore, was not entitled to favourable consideration under Rule 7B. \nAccordingly, the Court found the plea devoid of merit and dismissed it."}

State of Uttar Pradesh and Others].\nSingle-Judge Justice Ashutosh Srivastava was of the view that under the Act, a woman has the right to avail maternity leave even after the birth of child and this benefit can even be extended in a case of a legal adoption of a child of less than three months.\n\"The Act of 1961 was enacted to secure women's right to pregnancy and maternity leave and to afford women with as much flexibility as possible to live an autonomous life, both as a mother and as a worker, if they so desire,\" the Court observed.\nThe Court was hearing a petition moved by one Saroj Kumari, seeking issuance of a writ of certiorari against the order passed by the District Basic Shiksha Adhikari, Etah, whereby, she has been denied maternity leave on the ground that maternity leave cannot be granted after child birth. The order also stated that the petitioner can only apply for child care leave under the Act.\nThe petitioner was posted as headmistress of the primary school of Heerapur in Etah district in the institution run by the Board of Basic Education, Prayagraj. The service conditions of the petitioner were governed by the provisions of Uttar Pradesh Basic Education (Teachers) Service Rules, 1981.\nOn October 15, 2022, the petitioner gave birth to a girl child and after discharge from the hospital, she immediately applied for maternity leave for the period from October 18, 2022 to April 15, 2023 (for 180 days). However, the same was rejected on the ground that annexures in support of maternity leave were incomplete.\nThe petitioner applied again for maternity leave on October 30, 2022 in the prescribed proforma, but it rejected by the District Basic Education Officer, Etah with remarks that the petitioner is not entitled to maternity leave after child birth and is only eligible for child care leave and therefore, she can only apply for child care leave.\nAggrieved, the petitioner approached the High Court.\nBefore the Court, the petitioner stated that the 1961 Act was enacted by the parliament to regulate employment of women in certain establishmenta for certain period before and after child birth and to provide maternity leave benefit and certain other benefits. \nTherefore, the denial of the maternity leave to the petitioner on the ground that the child was born, and therefore the petitioner is not entitled to the maternity leave is per se illegal and erroneous.\nIt was also submitted that the child care Lleave is distinct from the maternity benefit and operate in different fields and relegating the petitioner to avail child care leave was totally unwarranted. \nMoreover, it was highlighted that the respondents stopped the salary of the petitioner since November and December, 2022.\nOn the other hand, the respondents have supported the rejection order and stated that there was no infirmity in the same.\nThe Court examined the purpose of enactment of the 1961 Act, which is to regulate the employment of women in certain establishments for certain periods before and after child-birth and to provide for maternity benefit and certain other benefits.\nThe Court further analysed Section 5 of the Act, which talks about payment of maternity benefits to a woman for the period of her actual absence beginning from the period immediately preceding the day of her delivery, the actual day of her delivery and any period immediately following that day. The provision further provides for the maximum period for which any woman shall be entitled to maternity benefit.\nConsidering the preamble and the provisions of the 1961 Act, the Court observed,\n\"These provisions have been made by Parliament to ensure that the absence of a woman away from the place of work occasioned by the delivery of a child does not hinder her entitlement to receive wages for that period or for that matter for the period during which she should be granted leave in order to look after her child after the birth takes place. \nThe Court underlined that Section 5 entitles a woman to maternity leave even after the birth of the child.\n\"From the perusal of the Preamble of the Act, Section 5 (1), third proviso to sub-section 3 of Section 5, sub-section 4 of Section 5, it is more than apparent that the Maternity Benefit can be extended even after birth of a child. It can even be extended in a case of a legal adoption of a child or less than three months.\"\nHowever, the Court cautioned that the maternity leave may not be granted for entire 180 days or 26 weeks.\nWith regard to the option of child care leave put forth before the petitioner by the order of the District Basic Education Officer, the Court placed reliance to decision of the Supreme Court in Deepika Singh v. Central Administrative Tribunal and others (2022), and stated,\n\"Availability of child care leave to the petitioner or grant of the same cannot dis-entitle the petitioner for grant of maternity benefit. Maternity benefit and child care leave both operate in different fields and are mutually exclusive.\"\nRegarding the interpretation of the provisions of the 1961 Act, the Court was of the view that a purposive interpretation is required to be adopted since the grant of maternity leave is intended to facilitate the continuance of women in the work place.\n\"It is a harsh reality that but for such provisions many women would be compelled by social circumstances to give up work on the birth of the child if they are not granted leave and other facilitative measures. No employer can perceive child birth as detracting from the purpose of employment. Child birth has to be construed in the context of employment as a natural incident of life and the provisions of the Maternity Benefit Act are required to be construed in that perspective,\" the Court observed.\nTherefore, the Court set aside the order passed by the District Basic Education Officer, Etah, who had refused to grant maternity leave to the petitioner after birth of child.\nFurther, the Education officer was directed to release the arrears of salary and pay the salary month to month to the petitioner as and when the same falls due.\nLastly, the Court ordered the officer to pass fresh orders keeping in mind the provisions of the Act. \nAdvocate Satyendra Chandra Tripathi appeared for the petitioner.\nAdvocate Shailendra Singh appeared for the respondents."}

We may, however, clarify that the findings rendered in the judgment are on the footing that the exercise of power made in the year 2019 under clauses (1) and (3) of Article 370 of the Constitution is valid. We are aware that the issue of the validity of the exercise of the said powers is the subject matter of petitions pending before this Court. Therefore, we have not dealt with the issue of validity,\" the Court said.\nThe bench had on December 1 reserved judgment in the plea challenging the notifications for the delimitation of assembly constituencies in J&K, after hearing the counsel for two days. \nThe petition was filed by two Srinagar residents, Haji Abdul Gani Khan and Dr Mohammad Ayub Mattoo, challenging the increase in the number of seats from 107 to 114 in the UT claiming that the same was ultra vires Articles 81, 82, 170, 330 and 332 of the Indian Constitution and Section 63 of the Jammu & Kashmir Re-organisation Act, 2019.\nIt was contended that the respondents had no power to establish a Delimitation Commission under Section 3 of the Delimitation Act since only the Election Commission could carry out the process of delimitation after the notification of the Parliamentary and Assembly Constituencies Delimitation Order, 2008.\nThe plea also pointed out that Article 170 of the Constitution provides the next delimitation to be taken up after 2026, however, the Union Territory of J&K was singled out.\nSenior Advocate Ravi Shankar Jandhyala, appearing for the petitioners, had submitted that increasing the number of seats was in violation of the constitutional amendment which froze any delimitation exercises till 2026. \nHe had also pointed out that four northeastern States were excluded from the exercise, which was a violation of Article 14 (right to equality before the law).\nJustice Oka had repeatedly posed the question as to why the present plea, filed under Article 32, had not challenged the validity of provisions of the Jammu & Kashmir Reorganisation Act that allows delimitation. \nSection 62(2) of the said Act provides for re-adjustment of constituencies in the Union Territory by a Delimitation Commission. \nSolicitor General (SG) Tushar Mehta, appearing for the respondents, had argued that Reorganisation Acts have been used in the past to increase the number of MLAs. \nThe SG had argued that the legislative intent of the Reorganisation Act was to take care of temporary exigencies and peculiar circumstances, and that is why the commission conducted the first delimitation exercise, and the ECI can follow. \nThe top court in its judgment made it clear Article 170 is not applicable to the legislature of the Union Territory.\n\"The reason is that the Legislative Assemblies of the concerned Union Territories will be governed by the law made by the Parliament in accordance with Article 239A and not by the provisions of Chapter III of Part VI. As Article 170 is not applicable to the Legislature of the Union Territory of J & K, the main thrust of the argument that certain provisions of the J&K Reorganisation Act and actions taken thereunder are in conflict with Article 170 and in particular Clause (3) thereof is clearly misconceived and deserves to be rejected\", the Court explained. \nFailure of the legislature to modify the time limit provided in sub-Section (6) of Section 10 of the 2002 Delimitation Act cannot be ground to hold that the Central government is powerless to appoint a Delimitation Commission for the UT of J&K, the Court.\nIf that is done the provisions of Section 62 of the J&K Reorganisation Act will be rendered nugatory, the Court reasoned.\n\"A statute cannot be interpreted in a manner that will render some of its provisions otiose. A statute must be construed and interpreted in such a manner as to make it workable,\" the bench explained.\nOn the exclusion of four north-eastern States (Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, Nagaland) from the 2020 delimitation notification, the top court observed that the two cannot be compared.\n\"In its applicability to the Union Territory of J & K, Sections 4 and 9 of the Delimitation Act, 2002 stand amended by requiring readjustment to be carried out on the basis of the census figures of 2011. In case of the North Eastern States, there is no such amendment. Therefore, two unequal cannot be treated as equals. Hence, the argument based on the violation of Constitutional provisions including Article 14 deserves to be rejected.\"\nSimilarly, the manner in which delimitation exercises have since been carried out and implemented in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, as well as Uttar Pradesh/Uttarakhand can also not be relied upon, it was held. \n\"In both the Acts [UP and AP Reorganisation], there is no provision which is pari materia with clause (b) of subSection (1) of Section 62 of the J&K Reorganisation Act which amended the provisions of the Delimitation Act 2002 in its applicability to the newly formed Union Territories by substituting the year 2001 with 2011.\"\nBesides Senior Counsel Jandhyala, advocates Sriram Parakkat and MS Vishnu Shankar represented the petitioners. \nSG Tushar Mehta and advocate Kanu Agrawal represented the respondents."}

By conducting Indian Premier League (IPL) and exercising control over this tournament, founded by the BCCI in the year 2007, which is the most attended cricket league in the world and ranked 6th by average attendance amongst all sports leagues is the major sporting event in the world to be broadcast live on various channels,\" the judge noted.\nHence, though the Memorandum of Association of the BCCI prescribe that the income, funds and properties of the BCCI shall be utilized solely for promotion of objects of BCCI, to aid and assist financially, or otherwise to promote, encourage, advance and develop the game of cricket, the fact that the Board engages itself in it’s various commercial activities would mean that BCCI is 'shop' under under the provisions of Mumbai Shop and Establishment Act.\nConsequently, it will come under the ambit of ESI Act, the Court ruled.\n\"I have no hesitancy to hold that the nature of activities conducted by the Board are commercial in nature and hence, covered under the term ‘shop’ for the purpose of ESI Act and notification issued thereunder,\" the judge held.\nThe Court was hearing an appeal filed by the BCCI challenging decision of the ESI Court in Mumbai, which had held that the board can be categorised as \"shop\" under Mumbai Shop and Establishment Act and would, therefore, be covered by ESI Act.\nThis decision was taken following a surprise inspection by an Insurance Inspector in April-May 2011, wherein employees and their salaries, present on the board office premises were examined. \nSubsequently, a notice was sent in Proforma C-18 dated July 1, 2014, claiming contribution amount to the tune of ₹5,04,075 as Employees State Insurance Contribution for the period commencing from May 2007 to March 2014.\nThe BCCI on the other hand, claimed that it couldn't be covered under the ESI Act, since it is a governing body for cricket in India and its primary object is to administer, promote and control the game of cricket throughout the country, including women’s cricket and to encourage formation of State, regional and other cricket associations. Therefore, it is not covered or registered as ‘shop’ under the provisions of Mumbai Shop and Establishment Act.\nIn her order, Justice Dangre noted that the ESI Act, 1948, seeks to secure maintenance of health of an insured workman by recognising the right to medical benefit as a fundamental right under the Constitution.\nIt is intended to confer certain benefits upon the employee in case of sickness, maternity and employment injury and to make provision for certain other benefits.\n\"Thus, the enactment is intended to operate as a beneficial piece of legislation to attain general welfare of the employees,\" the judge held.\nTo categorise the BCCI as a shop, the judge adverted to the \"systematic commercial profit making activity\" of the Board, which has it’s source of income on different counts like holding of international tours, income from IPL, selling rights of broadcasting the cricket matches, sponsorship, sale of tickets, etc.\n\"The Board is admittedly involved in entertaining and carrying out systematic commercial activity and is engaged in providing services to public at large by engaging its employees, organizing events, promoting cricket as a source of entertainment and thereby collecting funds. It is also engaged in acquisition or purchase of movable or immovable assets, tangible or intangible and authorised to sale or transfer the same for achieving its objectives,\" the judge noted further.\nTherefore, the Court upheld the decision of the ESI court to hold that BCCI falls under the ambit of ESI Act.\nAdvocates Aditya Thakkar, Ranjit Shetty and Rahul Dev along with Argus Partners appeared for the BCCI.\nAdvocates Shailesh Pathak and Jay Vora represented the respondents."}
{"ID": "id_80", "Summary": "In a significant judgment passed on Thursday, the Supreme Court called for a committee including the Chief Justice of India to appoint members of the Election Commission of India (ECI).\nIn its verdict, the Constitution Bench also went on to comment on independence of Election Commissioners, the rise of money power and criminalisation in politics, and more. \nWatch the operative part of the Judgment\nHere are ten things the Court said in its judgment.\n1. There is huge surge in the role of money power and criminalisation of politics. Certain sections of the media have forgotten their invaluable role and have turned unashamedly partisan.\n2. A law cannot be perpetuation of what is existing, of the executive having the absolute say in appointments...Political parties would have a reason to not seek a law, which is clear to see. A party in power will have an insatiable quest to remain in power through a servile Commission. \n3. EC has to be independent, it cannot claim to be independent then act in an unfair manner. A person in state of obligation to the government cannot have an independent frame of mind. An independent person will not be servile to those in power.\n4. What is independence? Competence is not to be bound by fear. Qualities of competence have to be supplemented by independence. An honest person would ordinarily unflinchingly take on the high and mighty. A common person will look up to him to ensure that democracy is preserved.\n5. An EC that does not guarantee rule of law is against democracy. In its wide spectrum of powers, if exercised illegally or unconstitutionally, it has an effect on the outcome of political parties.\n6. Ends cannot justify wrong means. Democracy can succeed only as all stakeholders work on it to maintain the purity of the election process so as to reflect the will of people. With rise in media coverage and others, the propensity of misuse of election machinery lies.\n7. Any process that seeks to improve the election process before this Court must be considered. Once results are out, matter largely becomes a fait accompli. Lincoln declared democracy to be by, for and of the people. Government should run as per the laws.\n8. The powers of appointment are capable of being misused, this may be writ large across the country. The fate of political parties and their candidates rests in the hands of the ECI, vitally important decisions are taken by those who helm its affairs.\n9. Democracy can be achieved only when the governing parties attempt to uphold it in letter and spirit. We find that the ECI has been charged with the duty and powers to hold elections for states and Parliament. It is duty-bound to act in a free and fair manner.\n10. Hallmark of a substantial and liberal democracy must be borne in mind, democracy is inextricably linked to the power of the people. The power of the ballot is supreme, capable of unseating the most powerful parties.\nWatch the pronouncement of judgment below:"}

The petitioners as officers of the second respondent could have sometimes remarked about his lapse or the way he conducted himself in the office or while discharging the duties. That cannot be given with a criminal colour and portrayed as offences of intimidation, harassment or humiliation contemplated under the Special Act,\" the Court said.\nCourt proceedings cannot be used as a weapon to wreak the vengeance, the single-judge underscored.\nIt, therefore, quashed the proceedings initiated before a trial court against three senior officials of Air India, who were charged under the Act for allegedly having harassed their subordinate belonging to the SC/ST community. \nThe Court also said that all parties to the case were Air India employees, the alleged offence should be considered as one that occurred at the workplace and the petitioners were 'public servants' as defined under Section 21 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). \nHence, the prosecuting agency should have obtained prior sanction under Section 197 of the Criminal Procedure Code before filing its chargesheet, the Court stated.\nAs per the complainant, the alleged harassment and humiliation had taken place on several occasions between the years 2018 and 2019. The complainant had accused three senior officials of such harassment. \nHowever, the Court said that prosecution had not inquired into the specific allegations made against the three accused persons and had simply filed one common chargesheet that too, after much delay, the judge said.\n\"For every occurrence, individual complaints ought to have been made at the relevant point of time as against each accused and such allegations cannot be combined in one complaint and culminate into a single charge sheet,\" the High Court said. \nFurther, the single-judge noted that records showed that the complainant had the habit of making multiple complaints to his superiors and had sent at least 120 emails and letters of complaints over the years to senior authorities. \nHe had also faced disciplinary proceedings for several lapses at work, including an incident that had delayed an Air India flight's take-off by an hour and a half. \n\"In all probabilities, the materials do not disclose any cognizable offence against the petitioners in respect of the charges leveled against them.

{"ID": "id_81", "Summary": "A Full Bench of Bombay High Court on Friday ruled that persons convicted under the Protections of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act cannot be granted emergency (COVID-19) parole under the Maharashtra Prisons (Mumbai Furlough and Parole (Amendment) Rules, 2020 (Parole Rules).\nThe court ruled that the proviso to Rule 19 of the Parole Rules which bars prisoners convicted under certain special laws from availing parole would include POCSO prisoners too though POCSO is not expressly provided in the said proviso. \nThe judgment was rendered by a Bench of Justices KK Tated, GS Kulkarni and NR Borkar which heard the matter after a Division Bench of Justices SS Shinde and MS Karnik referred the issue to a larger bench in view of conflicting judgments by different Benches of the High Court.\nThe Full Bench framed two questions of law which they answered as follows:\n1. Between the judgments of Vijendra Malaram Ranwa and Sardar s/o. Shawali Khan, the interpretation of Rule 19 of the Parole Rules was accurate in the Sardar s/o. Shawali Khan judgment.\n2. The proviso under Rule 19 (dealing with emergency parole) includes the special act of POCSO Act, thereby, implying that the emergency parole rules cannot apply to the convicts under the POCSO Act.\nIn May this year, the Maharashtra Government had issued a notification amending Rule 19 of the State's Prison and Parole Rules to allow the release of prisoners on COVID-19 emergency parole. \nHowever, a proviso was also inserted to Rule 19 to specify that these provisions would not apply to those convicted under Special Acts \"like MCOC, PMLA, MPID, NDPS, UAPA etc.\"\nThe court held that the list is not exhaustive but only indicative of the legislative intent to carve out exception for prisoners who are convicted for serious offences under the specified as well as non-specified Special Acts which should include POCSO and TADA.\n\"The reference as made in the proviso to certain special Acts is certainly not exhaustive and it would include within its ambit other similar Acts where the offences are serious. The Court cannot be oblivious that when the accused is sentenced for seven years and above under the provisions of the POCSO Act, it is certainly a conviction for a serious offence affecting the society at large,\"\nthe High Court said.\nThat the proviso uses the words “like” and “etc” is a significant indication of the legislative intent that the list of special Acts enlisted is not exhaustive, the court added.\nDuring arguments made on Thursday evening, advocate Rupesh Jaiswal, appearing for the Petitioner, had contended that because the POCSO Act does not find a place in the proviso, the prisoners convicted under the POCSO Act can avail benefit of emergency parole. \nSince the POCSO Act was not expressly mentioned, he contended that convicts under the POCSO Act were also entitled to COVID-19 emergency parole.\nHe also pointed out that unlike the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crimes Act (MCOC) or Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, which provide additional restrictions on bail, the POCSO Act did not have any special restrictions for bail.\nIt was further submitted that all convicted prisoners are entitled to parole when it comes to emergency parole under Rule 19 of the Parole rules. \nJaiswal added that the purpose of parole was to release the convict who has served three-fourth of his sentence so that he can mix with the general populace.\nThe Court also heard submissions made by the Public Prosecutor before delivering the judgment. \nWith the legal issues before them answered, the court directed the registry to place the plea before appropriate Bench for decision on the individual case on merits."}

Grace Industries Ltd had made false representations regarding kiln infrastructure and production capacity,\" the Court said.\nIt was further noted that in most cases, conspiracy was not supported by direct proof and was backed only by circumstantial evidence.\nIn this case, the same was satisfied, the Court held.\nThe issue had germinated when two parliamentarians, Prakash Javadekar and Hans Raj Ahir, along with one one political leader advocate Bhupendra Yadav made a complaint to the Central Vigilance Commissioner in March 2012 regarding corruption by Ministry of Coal officials by free allotment of coal during the period of 2006-2009.\nAs per the charge sheet, the accused in the years between 2005 – 2011 entered into a criminal conspiracy with the object of cheating the Ministry of Coal to procure allocation of “Lohara East Coal Block” in favour of GIL.\nThe charge sheet stipulated that this conspiracy was carried out by making false claims about the company’s net worth, equipment, existing capacity, status of procurement and installation of plant and machinery in the application form.\nAnother former director of GIL, Seema Gupta and the ex-director of Geology & Mining, Maharashtra Vishwas Sawakhande were acquitted.\nWhile arguing on the point of sentence, the CBI submitted that a loss to the tune of ₹1.86 lakh crores was caused to the government exchequer due to this coal block allocation scam.\nIt was stated that as a result of the scam, the Supreme Court had to cancel the allocation of 214 coal blocks allocated to different companies.\nAdditionally, it was stated that the scam caused companies to stop coming forward to mine coal blocks and despite availability of ample coal, there was a shortage of supply and coal was being imported.\nOn the other hand, former coal secretary Gupta and Ex Joint Secretary Kropha’s counsel said that there was no allegation that the two ever sought or received any personal benefits from GIL or its director.\nFurther, in response to the CBI’s argument relating to the loss suffered by the country was due to the government’s refusal to agree to the proposal to introduce bidding for the purposes of allocating coal blocks.\nFurther, it was submitted that Gupta and Kropha were both senior citizens, who were not flight risks and were in a precarious financial situation.\nTherefore, leniency while awarding sentence was urged.\nSpecial Judge Bhardwaj took note of the fact that sentencing was the most important stage after conclusion of the trial in a criminal case where mitigating and aggravating circumstances were to be considered by the court.\nWith this principle in mind, the decision on sentence was pronounced. \nAdvocate Sanjay Kumar appeared for the CBI. \nAdvocates Akshay Ringe, KK Patra and Rahul Tyagi appeared for the convicts. \nAdvocate KK Patra also acted as the Amicus Curie."}

{"ID": "id_831", "Summary": "Mere claim of two adults living together for a few days will not be sufficient to attach legitimacy to a live-in relationship, the Punjab & Haryana High Court recently observed, dismissing a plea by a 20-year-old boy and a 14-year-old girl who claimed to be in live-in relationship and sought protection to their life and liberty from their relatives.\nThe Court noted that the concept of live-in-relationship between two adults of opposite gender has got recognition in India also, as the legislature has injected some legitimacy in this kind of alliance, while promulgating “Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005” and liberally defined “domestic relationship” in Section 2(f).\nHowever, it has to be constantly borne in mind that the length of the relationship coupled with discharge of certain duties and responsibilities towards each other are elements which would make such relationship akin to the marital relations, Justice Manoj Bajaj said. \n“To attach legitimate sanctity to such a relation, certain conditions are required to be fulfilled by such partners. Merely because the two adults are living together for few days, their claim of live-in-relationship based upon bald averment may not be enough to hold that they are truly in live-in-relationship,” the Court ruled.\nThe Court also did not view favourably, the tendency of large number of young people to file petitions before the Court claiming to be in live-in relationship.\n“Majority of such petitions contain formal symbolic averments, grounds with imaginary cause of action, and are rarely founded upon 'actual' or 'real' existence of threat, and these types of cases consume considerable time of this court, that too at the cost of many other cases waiting in line for hearing,” the Court remarked.\nIn the instant case, the contention of petitioners was that they were in love but the girl’s parents were opposed to the relationship.\nThe parents of the girl started making arrangements for her marriage even though she was below the legal age of marriage.\nShe then left her house and contacted the boy and they decided to reside together in live-in-relationship till they attain marriageable age.\nThey alleged that the parents of the girl then started threatening them whereupon they sent a representation to the police but since there was no action they were constrained to move the Court.\nThey also submitted that till date, there was no physical intimacy between the petitioners as they are waiting to attain the statutory marriageable age, therefore, the private respondents have no right to interfere in their life.\nThe Court said that two adults have the right to live together and Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 to an extent legitimises such relationships.\nHowever, as per the 2013 judgment of the Supreme Court in Indra Sarma v. VKV Sarma, there are conditions to attach legitimate sanctity to such relationships.\nThis include duration of relationship, shared household, pooling of resources and financial arrangements, domestic arrangement, sexual relationship, children, socialisation in public etc.\nIn the instant case, the Court noted that the girl is only 14 years old and the boy was representing her claiming himself to be the next friend of minor.\n\"Besides, the writ petition is not signed by any of the petitioners and in support of the pleadings, only the affidavit of petitioner No.1 (boy) has been filed,\" the Court further observed. \nIt further stated that though, as per averments in the writ petition, entire blame has been put upon the natural guardians of the minor girl to set up compelling circumstances for her to voluntarily leave the house of parents, in order to join the company of the boy, but there is no pleading by him that his interest is not adverse to the interest of the minor and he is acting for the welfare of the minor girl.\nMoreover, the Court also noted that the petitioner is already an accused in case of kidnapping the minor girl and, therefore, his stand to claim himself as lawful representative of minor girl is not worth acceptance. \nFurther, the representation to the police, the Court said, was also vague and bereft of any material facts and details. \n\"Thus, it is apparent that the present petition has been filed hastily by petitioner No.1 to put up a defence to the above FIR registered at the instance of respondent No.5 (father of the girl),\" the Court said dismissing the plea. \nThe Court also ordered the Police to ensure that the custody of the minor girl is restored to her parents."}
{"ID": "id_833", "Summary": "The Delhi High Court recently observed that arresting an individual merely on allegations has the potential to destroy their reputation, and it is therefore necessary to apply great care and circumspection while dealing with arrests at the pre-conviction stage (Radhye Shyam v State).\nThe observations came from Justice Subramonium Prasad as he granted anticipatory bail to a man accused of raping an employee working in his company’s human resources department. The man, named Radhye Shyam, allegedly even forced few other women in his company to have physical relations with him.\nJustice Prasad said that whether the accused had sexual intercourse with the complainant consensually or not will be dealt with by the trial court and it would refrain itself from commenting on the case’s merits.\n“This Court finds it pertinent to note that consequent arrest of an individual on the basis of mere allegations has the potential to destroy the reputation of the said individual. Therefore, it is necessary to apply great care and circumspection while dealing with arrest at a pre-conviction stage,” the Court said.\nThe woman had joined the company, M/s Dabas Securities and Allied Services in June 2020. The allegation was that in November 2020, the accused allured her to meet him at a hotel and had forceful sexual intercourse with her. The man allegedly raped her again in December 2020. However, when he tried to do the same act again in January 2021 the complainant refused.\nThe man then fired her from the company. However, she joined the job again after talking to the reporting manager who said that she too had been similarly harassed by the owner.\nAs she joined, she was given a promotion and a raise. She later came to know that a receptionist at the company was also forced into having sexual relations with the man. As she narrated the incident to one of her colleagues he called the accused and told him to desist from exploiting his employees. The accused then got a First Information Report (FIR) registered against him for criminal intimidation.\nAppearing for Shyam, Senior Advocate Mohit Mathur, argued that the petitioner and the complainant were in an employer-employee relationship which later developed into a consensual physical relationship. He added that the woman had sexual relations with him on three different occasions and even travelled to Agra for a business trip where she stayed with him for three days. \nHe further contended that if the complainant had been raped, she out to have lodged an FIR immediately but in the present case this was done nearly six months after the first alleged incident.\nThough the trial court had earlier dismissed the man’s bail application in July, the High Court now noted that two witnesses who were employees of the company have already left and therefore, the man is not in a position to influence them.\n“Further, mere apprehension of tampering with evidence or influencing the witnesses cannot be a ground for rejecting an application for anticipatory bail,” the Court said.\nApart from Mathur, the petitioner was also represented by advocates Damanpreet Kohli, Manish Malhotra, Tarun Gaur and Harsh Gautam. The State was represented by Additional Public Prosecutor Meenakshi Chauhan."}

{"ID": "id_836", "Summary": "The parameters for cruelty for awarding death penalty are set very high by the Supreme Court that it is close to impossible for courts to award capital punishment to a convict even if his actions are extremely diabolical, the Madhya Pradesh High Court recently observed [Ankit Vijayvargiya vs State of Madhya Pradesh].\n\"This court is of the considered view that with the parameters of cruelty set so high nowadays for an offence to fall under the ambit of rarest of rare, as has also been recorded by the Supreme Court in the case of Mohammad Firoz vs State of Madhya Pradesh, it is, if not impossible, but is very difficult for any person to get the death penalty no matter how diabolic his actions are,\" the judgment passed on June 15 stated.\nA division bench of Justices Subodh Abhyankar and Satyendra Kumar Singh further said that even if a convict is awarded death sentence, the same is not acted upon within a reasonable time, thereby, losing its deterrent value.\n\"It is also seen that even when the death penalty of an accused is affirmed by the Apex Court,, it would still not be acted upon, leading to further suffering by the victims of the heinous crimes. The kith and kin of such victims who are also the victims, spend their lifetime in the hope that they would get some solace, some justice but all their hopes are crushed under the procedural system. This court is of the view that 'capital punishment' which is not awarded or executed within a reasonable time, loses its importance as a deterrence, as people have a very short memory and such offences usually get into oblivion, waiting for the next one to happen,\" the judgment said. \nTherefore, the bench deemed it fit to direct the government to reconsider the provision of death sentence \"as a mode of punishment as deterrence so that at least the victims of such crimes would get on with their lives, accepting their fate and would be saved from nurturing a false hope for decades altogether.\"\nThe observations were made while commuting the death sentence of a 30-year-old, convicted of rape and murder of a minor girl. \nThe appellant one Ankit Vijayvargiya, a resident of Mhow in Madhya Pradesh, was convicted and handed down death sentence by a sessions judge on February 24, 2020. \nThe man was convicted for offences under Sections 363 (kidnapping), (366A) inducing a minor for sex, 376AB (raping the minor), 302 (murder), and 201 (destroying evidence) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and for the offences of penetrative sexual assault and aggravated penetrative sexual assault under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO Act).\nAs per the prosecution case, on December 2, 2019, the appellant had picked up the minor victim, who was sleeping on a footpath along with her parents. He took her to an abandoned bungalow and raped her and since she was crying a lot, he strangulated her to death.\nThe bench in its judgment noted how the appellant had strangulated the minor girl breaking her neck, damaging her wind pipe and other internal organs. It also noted that the material on record was sufficient to convict the appellant and thus upheld his conviction.\nHowever, the bench noted that the sessions court while granting him death sentence, did not consider the mitigating circumstances in his favor.\n\"Considering the totality of the evidence brought on record, viz., the death sentence was awarded to the appellant on the same day on which he was found guilty, depriving him of his valuable right to bring to the notice of the court any mitigating circumstances in his favour, the injuries suffered by the victim, and the fact that the appellant who himself is a father of a minor daughter, is aged 30 years with no criminal record, chances of his rehabilitation cannot be ruled out. We find it fit to impose a sentence of twenty years instead of death penalty on the appellant,\" the bench held.\nThe Court, therefore, commuted his death sentence to imprisonment for 20 years. \nAdvocate S K Meena appeared for the appellant while the State was represented by Government advocate Amit Singh Sisodiya."}

This was challenged before the Supreme Court;\n- The High Court relegated the parties to their remedy before the Andhra Pradesh Wakf Tribunal;\n- The appellants argued that the writ jurisdiction of the top court could not be excluded simply because statutory remedies are available;\n- Respondents argued that whether subject land is Wakf property was the exclusive jurisdiction of the Tribunal;\n- The Supreme Court, however, held that the Wakf Board’s decisions are subject to writ jurisdiction;\n - State government, as a juristic entity, can protect its property through the writ court, just as any individual could have;\n- Land dedicated for pious purposes was not immune from vesting with the State.\nThe judgment was delivered in an appeal by the State of Andhra Pradesh (now, Telangana) challenging a notification dating back to 2006 issued by the Wakf Board declaring land measuring 1,654 acres and 32 guntas as wakf property.\nThe challenge was first preferred before the Andhra Pradesh High Court, which dismissed the pleas while holding that whatever properties are treated as wakf cannot be reversed because they always remains as wakf properties. The High Court also laid down principles to be followed with respect to wakf property.\nIt further held that all disputes that arise relating to wakf property were to be adjudicated only by the Wakf Tribunal.\nThe appellants argued that the notification was issued without following any procedure, simply on the grounds that certain lands were not notified previously. It was also argued that the High Court’s writ jurisdiction could not be excluded only because there exist alternative statutory remedies.\nIt was further contended that Manikonda village, where the wakf property was located, was jagir land and subsequent to the commencement of the Abolition Regulation, conditional grants made in favour of temples, mosques or any institutions established for religious and pious purposes stood abolished.\nOn the other hand, the State firmly argued that whether the subject land is wakf property and whether the same was wrongly included in the list of wakfs exclusively fell within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Wakf Tribunal.\nAnother argument advanced by the respondent was that if a document shows that there is dedication for a pious or charitable or religious purpose, the right of the person dedicating the property is extinguished and the ownership is transferred to the Almighty.\nWhile dealing with the several issues that came up before the Division Bench, a detailed history of the subject matter was rendered in the judgment. The Court discussed the background of Hyderabad State and its administration immediately prior to accession and soon thereafter. The Jagir Abolition Regulation, the Atiyat Enquiries Act, the Abolition of Inams Act and the historical background of Wakf vis-a-vis Hyderabad were discussed.\nWhile carrying out this lengthy discussion, the judgment acknowledged the efforts of Justice V Ramasubramanian, one of the judges on the Bench, in tracing the history of questions relating to land disputes in the judgment Raj Kishan Pershad and Ors. v. Joint Collector-I.\nOn its detailed examination of precedent and statutory provisions, the Bench found that the High Court erred in relegating the parties to the statutory remedy.\n“Since the question was in respect of interpretation of the statutes and the documents primarily issued by the Sovereign, the matter needs to be examined on merits as detailed arguments have been addressed by learned counsel for the parties,” it was recorded.\nFurther, to establish that the writ jurisdiction of the Court was not barred, it was stated that the State government, as a juristic entity, had a right to protect its property through the writ court, just as any individual could have invoked the jurisdiction of the High Court.\n\"Therefore, the State Government is competent to invoke the writ jurisdiction against the action of the Wakf Board to declare the land measuring 1654 acres and 32 guntas as wakf property,\" the Court held.\nThe Court also categorically lay down that land dedicated for pious and religious purposes was not immune from vesting with the State.\nTherefore, the appeal was allowed and the notification of the Wakf Board was quashed. The land was vested in the State free from any encumbrances. 90% of the gross basic sum referred was made payable to the Dargah in terms of Section 10(2)(i) of the Andhra Pradesh (Telangana Area) Jagirs (Commutation) Regulation.\nSenior Advocate V Giri appeared for the State, while Senior Advocate Huzefa Ahmadi represented the State Wakf Board. \nSenior Advocate CS Vaidyanathan argued for the Telangana Infrastructure Development Corporation."}

She (petitioner) then moved the High Court seeking the quashing of this application.\nThe Court concluded that the mother was mandatorily required to report the offences to the police or SJPU under the POCSO Act.\nIn this context, the Court also opined that the email written by the petitioner to the school informing them about the bullying and sexual harassment faced by her son makes it clear that she had knowledge about the commission of offences under POCSO Act much before she gave the information to the school authorities.\n“As such, prima facie, the mother was mandatorily required to inform the local police or the SJPU about the same as per Section 19 of the POCSO Act,” the Court said.\nThe Court rejected the contention that she had performed her duty by informing the school in accordance with its Child Protection Policy. \nIt reasoned that statutory provision would override and will precede over any school policy. \nHowever, the Court also opined that the petition moved by the mother is clearly premature as no order has been passed yet on the application moved by Khanna.\nIt added that the trial court would have to apply its mind to decide whether to summon her as a proposed accused or not.\nMeanwhile, the High Court also dismissed the petition moved by Khanna against the trial court’s decision to first issue a notice to the victim’s mother on her application.\nKhanna's contention was that there is no procedure for serving notice upon the proposed accused either under Section 319, CrPC, Section 193, CrPC or under Section 33 of the POCSO Act.\nRejecting the argument as meritless, the Court opined that every case has its own facts and circumstances that may compel the court concerned to adopt a procedure not barred by law.\n“No doubt, it is true that Section 33 of the POCSO Act or Section 193 CrPC do not provide for serving a notice to the proposed accused, but at the same time, there is no such bar to serve a notice in the facts and circumstances of a particular case,” it added.\nThe Court also reasoned that the proposed accused in the case is the mother of the victim and the complainant herself.\nShe is also the victim, being the mother of a deceased child, the Court said, adding the trial court did not commit any illegality by deciding to provide her an opportunity of hearing first. \n“The Court still has to decide the application by applying its judicious mind in accordance with law. Consequently, this Court does not find any merit in the petition … filed by the principal Mrs. Surjeet Khanna,” it ordered, while dismissing the petitions.\nSenior Advocate Indira Jaising with Advocates Ganesh Sharma, Rohin Bhatt, Abhijeet Sharma represented the victim’s mother.\nAdvocate Rajesh Lamba represented the accused Surjeet Khanna.\nAdditional Advocate General Randhir Singh represented the State of Haryana.\nAdvocate ADS Sukhija was an amicus curiae in the case."}

{"ID": "id_851", "Summary": "The Supreme Court on Tuesday refused to recognize the right of same-sex couples to enter into marriages or have civil unions [Supriyo @ Supriya Chakraborty and anr v. Union of India].\nThe Court said that the law as it stands today does not recognise the right to marry or the right of same-sex couples to enter into civil unions, and that it is upto the Parliament to make laws enabling the same. \nThe Court also held that the law does not recognise rights of same-sex couples to adopt children. \nThe judgment was rendered by a Constitution Bench of Chief Justice of India (CJI) DY Chandrachud and Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul, S Ravindra Bhat, Hima Kohli and PS Narasimha. The Bench rendered four separate judgments.\nThe majority opinion was delivered by Justices Bhat, Kohli and Narasimha with Justice Narasimha delivering a separate concurring opinion. CJI Chandrachud and Justice Kaul delivered separate dissenting judgments.\nAll the judges were unanimous in holding that there is no unqualified right to marriage and same-sex couples cannot claim that as a fundamental right. \nThe Court also unanimously turned down the challenge to provisions of the Special Marriage Act. \nThe majority of Justices Bhat, Kohli and Narasimha also held that civil unions between same sex couples are not recognised under law and they cannot claim right to adopt children either.\nHowever, CJI Chandrachud and Justice Kaul in their separate minority opinions ruled that same-sex couples are entitled to recognise their relationships as civil union and can claim consequential benefits. \nIn this regard, they also said that such couples have the right to adopt children and struck down adoption regulations to the extent it prevented the same. \nCJI Chandrachud also said that provisions of Special Marriage Act cannot be struck down or words cannot be read into it to allow same-sex marriages.\nJustice Kaul said that Special Marriage Act is discriminatory towards queer couples but concurred with the CJI in holding that it cannot be interpreted to allow same-sex marriages. \nWATCH| Highlights of the minority and majority verdict in the marriage equality case:\nThe majority opinion rendered by Justice Ravindra Bhat held the following:\n- There is no unqualified right to marriage.\n- Entitlement to civil unions can be only through enacted laws and courts cannot enjoin such creation of a regulatory framework.\n- Queer persons are not prohibited in celebrating their love for each other, but have no right to claim recognition of such union.\n- Queer persons have the right to choose their own partner and they must be protected to enjoy such rights.\n- Same-sex couples do not have right to adopt children under existing law.\n- Central government shall set up a high-powered committee to undertake study of all relevant factors associated with same-sex marriage.\n- Transgender persons have the right to marry.\nThe Court in its minority opinion held that queer couples have a right to enter into civil unions, though they do not have the right to marry under the existing laws.\nThe following are the highlights of CJI Chandrachud's minority judgment:\n- Queerness is not urban or elite.\n- There is no universal concept of marriage. Marriage has attained the status of a legal institution due to regulations.\n- The Constitution does not grant a fundamental right to marry and the institution cannot be elevated to the status of a fundamental right. \n- Court cannot strike down provisions of the Special Marriage Act. It is for Parliament to decide the legal validity of same-sex marriage. Courts must steer clear of policy matters.\n- Freedom of queer community to enter into unions is guaranteed under the Constitution. Denial of their rights is a denial of fundamental rights. Right to enter into unions cannot be based on sexual orientation.\n- Transgender persons have the right to marry under existing law. \n- Queer couples have the right to jointly adopt a child. Regulation 5(3) of the Adoption Regulations as framed by the Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA) is violative of Article 15 of the Constitution for discriminating against the queer community.\n- Centre, states, union territories shall not bar queer people from entering into unions to avail benefits of the state.\nWatch the pronouncement of the judgment here:\nThe five-judge bench had reserved its verdict on May 11 this year, after a ten-day hearing. The Court was called upon to decide on a batch of pleas seeking legal recognition of same-sex marriages in India.\nAmong other developments during the course of the hearings, the Court noted that:\n- The US Supreme Court's decision that there was no Constitutional right to abortion was incorrect in the Indian context, and that an individual's right to adopt was not affected by their marital status in India.\n- Recognising same-sex unions was up to the Legislature, but the government may have to ensure that same-sex couples are given social and other benefits and legal rights without the label of marriage.\n- Courts cannot decide on issues based on young people's sentiments.\n- Marriages are entitled to constitutional and not just statutory protections.\nThe lead petition was filed by Supriyo Chakraborty and Abhay Dang, two gay men living in Hyderabad.\nSupriyo and Abhay have been a couple for almost 10 years. They both contracted COVID-19 during the second wave of the pandemic and when they recovered, they decided to have a wedding-cum-commitment ceremony to celebrate the ninth anniversary of their relationship.\nHowever, despite the same, they do not enjoy the rights of a married couple, the plea pointed out.\nIt was also contended that the Supreme Court in the Puttaswamy case, held that LGBTQIA+ persons enjoy the right to equality, dignity and privacy guaranteed by the Constitution on the same footing as all other citizens.\nThe Central government opposed the petitions in Court, saying that same-sex couples living together as partners and having sexual relationships is not comparable to the Indian family unit concept, which involves a biological man and a biological woman with children born out of such wedlock.\nThe government also underlined that there can be no fundamental right for recognition of a particular form of social relationship.\nRead about the 20 petitions seeking the legalisation of same-sex marriage, here.\nFollow our detailed coverage of Day 1 of the hearing here and here.\nFollow our detailed coverage of Day 2 of the hearing here and here.\nFollow our detailed coverage of Day 3 of the hearing here and here.\nFollow our detailed coverage of Day 4 of the hearing here and here.\nFollow our detailed coverage of Day 5 of the hearing here and here.\nFollow our detailed coverage of Day 6 of the hearing here and here.\nFollow our detailed coverage of Day 7 of the hearing here and here.\nFollow our detailed coverage of Day 8 of the hearing here and here.\nFollow our detailed coverage of Day 9 of the hearing here and here.\nFollow our detailed coverage of Day 10 of the hearing here and here."}

It was submitted that the Chief Minister's visits to the temple had ended up creating controversy and affecting the feelings and sentiments of Hindus. The petitioner added that not only was the Chief Minister violating the law, he was also compelling his cabinet ministers and subordinate authorities to violate the law. \nRejecting these contentions, the Court pointed out that it was a longstanding State tradition to invite serving Chief Ministers for prayers at Tirumala Tirupathi Devasthanams temples to present \"Pattu Vastralu\" during Brahmotsavam in accordance with the procedure provided under \"Kainkarya Patti\".\nIt was in this capacity that the Chief Minister entered the temple, the Court concluded.\n\"In the opinion of this Court, he entered into the Tirumala Tirupathi Devasthanam's temples, in the capacity of the Chief Minister of the State, as a representative of the people of the State, and as such, he need not submit a declaration as provided under Rule 136 of the Rules,\" the Court said.\nHolding that the Chief Minister’s entry into the temple as a representative of the people did not require a declaration under Rule 136, the Court clarified that his entry in his personal capacity should be backed by a declaration if he is not a Hindu.\nOn these terms, the petition was dismissed."}

It also contains antibodies that help the suckling babies fight off viruses and bacteria and breastfeeding lowers the babies’ risk of catching infections and allergies. Breastfeeding has also been linked to higher Intelligence Quotient in later childhood,\" the Court observed.\nIn her plea, the petitioner-mother stated that she hails from Jammu and was married to the respondent from Srinagar.

However, contrary to the medical advise, her husband insisted on normal delivery of the baby.\nIt was further alleged that her husband instead of taking care of her and abiding by the doctor's advise, forced her to undergo 'natural delivery' and stopped interaction with her and deserted her in the last month of pregnancy. The other relatives of her husband also deserted her, she alleged.\nIt was submitted that petitioner, being in the advance stage of her pregnancy and having no one to fall back upon in Srinagar, was compelled to call her parents from Jammu who flew to Srinagar in order to take care of her. \nSubsequently, a female child was born to the petitioner through C-section procedure. However, after she delivered the baby, the husband allegedly came to the hospital with some goons and threatened her of dire consequences for having undergone C-section against his wishes.\nLater, the husband's relatives came to the hospital and apologised for the conduct of the husband and asked her to return to the matrimonial house which she did. \nIt was alleged that upon return to the matrimonial home along with infant, her husband snatched the suckling baby from her arms and forcefully locked and confined the petitioner to a room.\nAfter 8 days of confinement, she managed to get hold of her mobile phone and contacted the Women’s Police Helpline to lodge a complaint after which she was taken to the Women Police Station, Rambagh. She informed the Women’s Grievance Cell that her infant daughter was illegally taken from her and unlawfully detained by the private respondents and was missing for the past seven days then. \nHowever, no action was taken on petitioner’s complaint prompting her to move the High Court. \nWhen the matter was heard on August 27, the respondent father undertook to surrender the child before the Court on August 31.\nBut when the matter came up for hearing on August 31, Tuesday, the Court noted that the respondents had not produced the baby. \n\"Mr. Zahoor A Shah, respondent no.5, was pointedly asked about the implementation of order passed by the Court on 27.08.2021 and the undertaking furnished by him in the open Court to produce the child before the Court at 4.30 pm on that day, but without any satisfactory reply, he insisted on grant of time to make submissions qua rejection of the claim of the petitioner,\" the Court noted in its order passed on Tuesday.\nThe Court, therefore, directed the SSP Srinagar to take all necessary measures to ensure recovery of 24 days old female child from the private respondents.\nThe Court also said that the petitioner is free to file a proper complaint before the concerned police station for alleged offences against her and her child by the private respondents.\nThe Court will hear the matter again on Wednesday at 2 pm.\nThe petitioner was represented by advocates Areeb Kawoosa, Attir Kawoosa and Baba Musharif."}

The lawyers were protesting against the restriction on entry to the District Court Complex at Shimla from a shorter route, forcing them to take a longer way, resulting in delay in attending court.\nOn the contrary, the Additional Advocate General appearing for the State contended that the petitioner cannot rely on a judgment where the Court had quashed a similar FIR filed against the co-accused, pertaining to the same incident.\nIt was also claimed that the lawyers, including the petitioner, indulged in hurling abuses and assaulting police personnel, as well as threatening to burn down a police station.\nThe Court, however, noted that the FIR nowhere mentions the role of the petitioner.\n\"Even if this Court presumes the petitioner present at the spot, it would still not lead to an automatic inference of her acting with a common object with those who had inflicted fist blows, hurled abuses, and threatened the SHO, and also threatened to burn the Police Station.\"\nMere presence at the spot in the demonstration would not invite criminal act in the facts and nature of allegations made in the present FIR, the Court added. \nOn the power of the Court to quash FIRs, Justice Chitkara referred to a number of apex court judgments to conclude,\n\"The law is almost settled by larger benches judgments of Supreme Court that the offences, those are not listed as compoundable, under Section 320 CrPC, can also be compounded, and the procedure to follow would be by quashing the FIR, and consequent proceedings.\"\nThe Court further found that there was no evidence which attracts the offences named in the FIR.

Consequently, the current petition was filed before the High Court.\nIt was observed by the Court that the Rules applicable to the employees of the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board require the existence of a valid marriage in order to extend pensionary benefits.\nHowever, since the union between the petitioner and her husband was solemnized before the first wife’s demise, the applicability of the Rules was in question. The issue was discussed at length by the Court.\nJustice Vaidyanathan noted that the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 does not permit second marriage while the first wife is still alive. However, he observed that as per the Domestic Violence Act, 2005,\n“Even without marriage, when the factum of live-in-relationship between a man and woman is established, it is held to be legally valid, and over a period of time, the woman attains the status of a wife. But, after the demise of the husband, if two wives are alive, the second one will not attain the legal status of 'wife' unless Personal Law permits.\"\nAfter reflecting upon the stream of jurisprudence established by various High Courts and the Supreme Court, the Single Judge Bench noted that since the Domestic Violence Act is a special enactment, it shall take precedence over the general law, ie the Tamil Nadu Pension Rules, 1978.\nDespite referring the matter to a larger bench in view of its complexity, Justice Vaidyanathan stated,\n“I am of the view that, the second wife attains the deeming status of a wife from the date of demise of the first wife, in case, the husband is alive on the date of demise of the first wife.”\nThe Court framed two issues to be considered by the larger bench:\n(i) Whether Rule 49 of the Tamil Nadu Pension Rules, 1978, can take away the rights guaranteed for women under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005; and\n(ii) Whether a concubine, after the enactment of the Domestic Violence Act, 2005, attains the status of a companion/wife after the demise of the first wife during the lifetime of her husband and that, due to continued live-in relationship, whether she attains the status of a wife, in order to get pensionary and other terminal benefits due to the deceased person.\nAdvocate D Kalaivani appeared for the petitioner, while the respondents were represented by Advocate Fakkir Mohideen."}

The time schedule has to be adhered to, otherwise, ultimately, it may affect the medical education and the public health,\" the order stated.\nIt, therefore, said that the decision taken by the authorities cannot be said to be arbitrary. \n\"The students cannot still pray for admission on those seats remaining vacant after approximately one year of academic session and remaining vacant after eight or nine rounds of counselling,\" the Bench in its order stated. \nThe Court noted that out of a total of 40,000 postgraduate seats, only 1,456 largely non-clinical seats were vacant. This fact had been earlier taken note of in the decision in Education Promotion Society for India and Anr, the order pointed out. \nThe four pleas filed by medical students seeking a special stray round of counselling had sought directions to be issued to the Central government to disclose the number of vacant AIQ seats after an earlier stray counselling round.\nThe plea filed through advocate Milind Kumar, instructed by Dubey Law Associates, had stated that the petitioners had participated in rounds 1 and 2 of AIQ Counselling and State quota counselling which was followed by All India mop-up and State mop-up rounds. However, they could not secure seats in any of the rounds till date.\nHowever, through responses to a Right to Information (RTI) application, the petitioners got to know that there are still vacant seats under the AIQ. Subsequently, representations were made to concerned authorities to conduct an additional stray round in the interests of students and colleges, but to no avail, the plea added.\nThe plea had, therefore, asked that the top court to issue a writ of mandamus to:\na) to direct respondent, Medical Counselling Committee (MCC) to provide the exact number of vacant seats after the conduct of stray vacancy round of AIQ;\nb) to direct respondent to conduct a special stray round of counselling to allow the candidates to participate for the vacant seats which are available after the conduct of stray vacancy round of AIQ;\nThe Central government had opposed the plea and filed an affidavit stating that the software for counselling had closed, preventing further rounds to fill up seats.\nIt was pointed out that an extra round to fill up vacant seats at this stage would also disrupt the counselling process for NEET-PG 2022 as the refund of security deposits had already been initiated.\nCounsel for the MCC submitted before the top court that students cannot be admitted mid-term merely because some seats have been left vacant, relying on the apex court's decision in Supreet Batra & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors.\nSenior Advocates Rachna Shrivastava and ADN Rao with advocates Avijit Mani Tripathi and Kunal Cheema appeared for the petitioners.\nAdditional Solicitor General Balbir Singh represented the Central government and advocate Gaurav Sharma appeared for the Medical Counselling Committee, and the National Board of Examinations."}

{"ID": "id_863", "Summary": "The Bombay High Court recently held that a divorced Muslim woman is entitled to mahr (lumpsum maintenance amount payable by husband to wife on divorce) from her husband as stipulated under Section 3 of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986 (MWPA) even if she has remarried. \nSingle-judge Justice Rajesh Patil observed that Section 3(1)(a) of the MWPA does not contain the word 'remarriage' and hence the protection of that maintenance (or mahr) was unconditional and would apply even after the woman (respondent) remarries. \n\"Nowhere does the said Act intend to limit the protection that is due to the former wife on the grounds of the remarriage of the former wife. The essence of the Act is that a divorced woman is entitled to a reasonable and fair provision and maintenance regardless of her remarriage. The fact of divorce between the husband and wife is in itself sufficient for the wife to claim maintenance under section 3(1)(a). Section 3 does not absolve the husband of his duty to make and pay a reasonable and fair,\" the judge observed in the order.\nThe Court further elaborated that if a condition is added in the Act that 'the husband is absolved of his duty when the wife remarries, then the husband would deliberately await his wife's marriage.\nSection 3 defines what is a 'mahr' or dower which is a lumpsum amount that a divorced Muslim woman is entitled to.\nSub-clause (1)(a) stipulates for a fair and reasonable maintenance that a woman is entitled to get within the iddat period (which is a short 2-3 month period after a marriage ends).\nThe judgment came in response to a revision application filed by a man challenging a maintenance order passed by Magistrate at Chiplun which was subsequently upheld and enhanced by the Sessions Court at Ratnagiri.\nThe couple had gotten married in 2005 and they had a daughter. In 2008, the petitioner divorced the wife and she applied for maintenance under Section 3(1)(a) in 2012. \nIn 2014, the Magistrate granted ₹4,32,000 as lumpsum maintenance to be payable by the petitioner to his former wife in 2 months. The petitioner challenged this order before the sessions court.\nThe sessions court in 2017 dismissed the appeal and enhanced the maintenance amount to ₹9 lakh payable by the petitioner within 2 months. On failure to pay, the amount was to carry interest @8% per year till the amount is completely paid. \nThe petitioner challenged this order before the High Court. He also paid ₹1,50,000 to the respondent in intervals.\nMeanwhile, the woman remarried in 2018. \nThe petitioner then sought quashing of the sessions court order on the ground that the respondent had remarried.\nJustice Patil did not agree with this argument and opined that the entitlement to a fair and reasonable provision and maintenance of a divorced wife is crystallised on the date of divorce and is not hampered by the former wife's remarriage.\n\"On the date of passing of impugned order the amount payable by the husband got crystallized, therefore, even in the future if the divorced wife re-marries, it will not make a difference if the amount is payable in lumsum. The difference would be only when the amount is payable monthly. Therefore, the amount of ₹9,00,000, in my opinion in fair and reasonable,\" the Court held."}

The seniority of advocates is premised on a standardised metric of merit aimed at forwarding the standards of the profession ... We have, thus, not the slightest hesitation in coming to the conclusion that this writ petition is a misadventure largely of petitioner No.1 in continuation of some of his past misadventures ... We dismiss the petition with no order as to costs\", the Court directed.\nThe Court had reserved its verdict in the matter on October 4 this year, after a day-long hearing.\nThe plea was filed by advocates Mathews Nedumpara, Rohini Mohit Amin, Maria Nedumpara, Rajesh Vishnu Adrekar, Hemali Suresh Kurne, and Sharad Vusudeo Koli, along with two others, an entrepreneur named Karan Kaushik, and a Chartered Accountant, Manisha Nimesh Mehta (petitioners).\nThe petitioners challenged the Senior designation system on the ground that it created a special class of advocates with special rights, privileges, and status that were not available to ordinary advocates. This was unconstitutional and violated the right to equality under Article 14 of the Constitution of India, they contended. \nThey further asserted that it violated the right to practice one's profession under Article 19 and the right to life under Article 21 of the Constitution. \nAs a result of the senior advocate designation system, the legal industry was being monopolised by a \"small cabal\" of designated advocates, leaving the vast majority of meritorious lawyers as \"ordinary plebeians\" who were meted out discriminatory treatment, the petitioners said.\nOnly the relatives of judges, politicians, and existing senior counsel benefitted from this system, they submitted. They argued that this system has destroyed the justice delivery system beyond redemption. The ambition to get such a designation makes younger members of the bar a slave to the bench, the petitioners further stressed.\nMoreover, lawyers resort to sycophancy and cavass for votes, while those practicing in the lower judiciary are out of contention for the gown, they added. \nTherefore, such a cabal must be put to an end and the senior designation system abolished, the petitioners asserted. \nJudgment\nThe top court at the outset noted that the pleadings were almost reckless in character. \n\"The vast number of first-generation lawyers who attained prominence and were designated as Senior Advocates are sought to be ignored – something which has grown over a period of time ... it has sought to be made out as if the legal profession in India has long been feudalistic and a monopoly of certain higher castes and certain families ... These averments are contemptuous in character\".\nIt added that the pleadings were completely devoid of merit and justification, with allegations against all and sundry. \n\"This is more so in the conspectus of the large growth in the legal profession where a large number of firstgeneration lawyers have made their mark. These lawyers, some of them young ones, have come from National Law Schools and other prominent Law Schools.\"\nThe bench explained that the senior designation system is a discernible and transparent mechanism devised by the bench. \n\"A special entitlement to address the Court is coupled with restrictions on many acts which they could otherwise perform as advocates ... The seniority of advocates is premised on a standardised metric of merit aimed at forwarding the standards of the profession ... the classification of advocates and the mechanism to grant seniority to advocates is not based on any arbitrary, artificial or evasive grounds.\"\nThe Supreme Court had in March 2019 barred Nedumpara from practicing before it for a year after finding him guilty of browbeating judges.\nAt the time, the top court also dismissed a plea by the National Lawyers Campaign for Judicial Transparency and Reforms, which Nedumpara heads, challenging the current system of the designation of lawyers as Senior Advocates.\nIn the instant verdict, the top court lamented that it appeared that Nedumpara had not learnt from the earlier rounds of litigation. \n\"It appears that the judgments and orders passed earlier do not seem to have had any salutary or counselling effect on petitioner No.1 for any self-introspection, but he seeks to carry on a vilification campaign against all and sundry.

On Monday, this Bench concluded:\nThe case before the Court concerned a girl who had run away from home alleging that she was being mistreated by her mother and brother. She had attempted to go and stay with a friend, as per one version of events. On the other side, it was alleged that she had been enticed into running away by her friend's brother and his family, for which a case had also been registered for kidnapping. \nA Magistrate directed that the girl be produced before a Child Welfare Committee, which directed that she be sent to a Children's Home. This was done on the ground that she was a minor victim, since her school certificates showed her age as 17 years, although her radiological report indicated that she may be 20 years old. Pertinently, the Juvenile Justice Act gives precedence to educational certificates over medical evidence.\nThe order sending the girl to the children's home was challenged by way of a habeas corpus petition, which also contended that the girl had expressed that she had wanted to live with her friend and that she cannot be detained in the children's home against her wishes. The case led to a question as to whether such a habeas corpus plea can be filed in such cases at all.\nThe High Court's Full Bench has now ruled that such habeas corpus petitions cannot be filed in these cases. Rather, the Court has clarified that the available course of redressal, if such an order is argued to be illegal or irregular, is to move the appellate forums prescribed under the Juvenile Justice Act. \nThe Court added that before passing orders for sending a minor to a children's home, \n\"The wish of minor and the wish/desire of girl can always be considered by the Magistrate concerned/Committee and as per her wishes/desire further follow up action be taken in accordance with law under the J.J.

The landlord had, however, refused to accept the keys and take back possession citing pending rental dues and damage to the premises, the tenant contended. \nThe landlords countered by arguing that the property was damaged and that some goods were lying in the basement. \nThey also staked a claim for recovering arrears of rent. \nHowever, after reviewing excerpts from a WhatsApp conversation between the parties, which was recorded as evidence, the court found that landlords presented no evidence to support this claim.\nRather, upon finding merit in the tenant's submissions, the Court concluded,\n\"On careful consideration of rival contentions of the parties and applying the well settled principles of law and following the dictum given in H.S Bedi case (supra) , it is established on record that defendant’s lease determined in the month of October, 2020 when the defendant offered the possession to the landlord-plaintiff who deliberately chose not to take the possession, therefore, the possession of the suit property is deemed to have been delivered to the landlord-plaintiff who is not entitled to the rent thereafter.\"\nThe Court, however, provided part relief to the landlords and found that they were entitled to rent payments for the period between April 2020 to October 2020 (that is, when the tenant was still occupying the premises), after adjusting a security deposit paid earlier by the tenant. \n\"The plaintiffs by not coming forward to take unconditional possession from the defendant cannot make it actionable for recovery of rent for the period after vacation of the suit property by the defendant,\" the Court added. \nSenior advocates Pawanjit S Bindra and advocate Vinayak Marwah represented plaintiffs.\nAdvocates Bharat Chugh, Mayank Arora, Aditya Narayan Choudhary, and Ashray Chopra represented the defendant-tenant."}

{"ID": "id_873", "Summary": "Actual use of violence is not always a sine qua non (essential condition) for invoking provisions of the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA), the Supreme Court held last week [Abhishek vs State of Maharashtra]. \nA division bench of Justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Aniruddha Bose ruled that threat of violence or even intimidation or even coercion would fall within the ambit of ‘organised crime' under MCOCA. \n\"Actual use of violence is not always a sine qua non for an activity falling within the mischief of organised crime, when undertaken by an individual singly or jointly as part of organised crime syndicate or on behalf of such syndicate. Threat of violence or even intimidation or even coercion would fall within the mischief,\" the judgment held.\nThis apart, use of other unlawful means would also fall within the same mischief, the Court added.\nThe Court was hearing a criminal appeal challenging a decision of the Bombay High Court's Nagpur bench, dismissing the appellant Abhishek's plea challenging invocation of MCOCA against him.\nAbhishek along with others, were booked in a criminal case lodged on May 8, 2020 under charges of kidnapping a restaurant owner in Nagpur for ransom of ₹20 lakh. \nThe police authorities subsequently granted sanction to prosecute the accused under the MCOCA, considering the fact that they have indulged in \"continuous criminal activities\" since Abhishek has been named in multiple such cases of violence.\nIn his defense, Abhishek argued that the authorities wrongly invoked MCOCA against him and erred in interpreting the provisions of the special enactment.\nThe Court said that strict adherence to provisions of the MCOCA by the authorities cannot be stretched beyond common sense and practical requirements.\n\"Strict adherence by the authorities concerned to the requirements of MCOCA also cannot be stretched beyond common sense and practical requirements in terms of the letter and spirit of the statute,\" the bench said.\nTo apply MCOCA in a case, the authorities must consider whether the basic and threshold requirements, as per Section 2(1) (d), (e) and (f) are fulfilled.\n\"It is not in doubt that the provisions of MCOCA need to be strictly construed and for their application, an unlawful activity has to fall within the periphery of organised crime....So far as the applicability of the rule of strict construction qua MCOCA is concerned, it being a special penal statute, this much is clear that no one is to be made subject to this law by implication or by presumption; and all doubts concerning its application would, ordinarily, be resolved in favour of the accused,\" the bench noted.\nHowever, the rule of strict construction cannot be applied in an impracticable manner so as to render the statute itself nugatory, the Court underlined. \n\"In other words, the rule of strict construction of a penal statute or a special penal statute is not intended to put all the provisions in such a tight iron cast that they become practically unworkable, and thereby, the entire purpose of the law is defeated,\" the judges added.\nBut the bench rejected the argument of the appellant that to attract Section 2(1) (e) which deals with organised crime, use of violence is essential.\n\"A bare look at clause (e) of Section 2(1) of MCOCA makes it clear that ‘organised crime’ means any unlawful activity by an individual singly or jointly, either as a member of organised crime syndicate or on behalf of such syndicate, by use of violence or threat of violence or intimidation or coercion or other unlawful means. The suggestions on behalf of the appellant to limit the activity only to the use of violence is obviously incorrect when it omits to mention the wide-ranging activities contemplated by clause (e) of Section 2(1) of MCOCA, i.e., threat or violence or intimidation or coercion or other unlawful means,\" the Court said. \nRegarding the contention that only \"pecuniary benefit\" gained must be considered by the authorities while invoking this law, the bench said it could also be 'gaining undue economic or other advantage’. \n\"The frame of the proposition that the object ought to be gaining pecuniary benefit or other ‘similar’ benefit is not correct as it misses out the specific phraseology of the enactment which refers to undue economic or other advantage apart from pecuniary benefit,\" the bench said.\nIt also relied upon a full bench judgment of the Bombay High Court in Jagan Gagansingh Nepali @ Jagya in which it was held that there could be advantage to a person committing a crime which may not be directly leading to pecuniary advantage or benefit but could be of getting a strong hold or supremacy in the society or even in the syndicate itself.\nThe bench further took into account the fact that all the cases, which are either pending or disposed of against the appellant, involved offences against human body and property, rioting and use of deadly weapons, which breached peace.\nAbhishek had further argued that of the previous cases against him, he was acquitted in one while in other, the Bombay High Court had quashed the proceedings.\nTo this, the bench noted that in the acquittal case, the witnesses had turned hostile and the main complainant didn't even turn up to depose. The other case was quashed as there were cross complaints and subsequently a settlement was arrived at. \nLastly, the judges said, \"The submissions on behalf of the appellant for consideration of his case because of application of stringent provisions impinging his fundamental rights does not take away the impact of the blameworthy conduct of the appellant. Any claim towards fundamental rights also cannot be justifiably made without the person concerned himself adhering to and submitting to the process of law.\"\nTherefore, the bench dismissed the appeal."}
{"ID": "id_874", "Summary": "The Madras High Court Thursday held that a college cannot be held responsible for the death of a student who died by drowning after jumping into the sea voluntarily against the directions of the college authorities.\nJustice SM Subramaniam said that the student had jumped into the sea for a bath despite the college authorities having prohibited all participants from doing so.\nHe had voluntarily taken a risk and, therefore, the principle of volenti non fit injuria could be squarely applied to the case, the Court said.\n\"Since it was the voluntary act of two students for jumping into the sea, the principle of “Volenti Non Fit Injuria” squarely applies to the facts of this case. Therefore, none can be blamed for the voluntary act of the deceased student. The deceased student at the time of drowning was aged about 21 years and capable of taking independent decision. He had not followed the instructions given by the organisers. Out of 54 students, two students alone jumped into the sea without even informing the Organisers. While so, the organisers cannot be held responsible for the voluntary act of the deceased student,\" the High Court ruled.\nThe Court, therefore, refused to grant a compensation of ₹25 lakh to the family of the student but instead granted a fixed compensation by adopting multiplier method and directed the respondent college to pay ₹5 lakh to the deceased's kin. \nThe Court was hearing a petition filed by the deceased student's family members. As per the plea, they belonged to a poor family. The deceased was a third year student in a private engineering college in Kancheepuram district in Tamil Nadu. \nOn September 27, 2014, the college organised a 'coastal cleaning' event, which it told the Court, was a voluntary event and was part of the National Service Scheme (NSS). \nFifty-four students participated in the event and though all participants had been prohibited from going into the sea by the college authorities, two students jumped into the sea for a bath after the cleaning activity was over.\nOne of them drowned and passed away. \nThe petitioner's counsel told the Court that the College had failed to inform the district collectorate and the local police about the event, and that it did not have the requisite permission from the district authorities for the beach cleaning activity. \nIt was also submitted that there were no life guards or coast guard authorities to rescue the drowning students. On seeing that the two boys were drowning, another student, one of the participants had jumped after them and managed to save one of them, they told the Court.\nBy not informing the authorities of the event in advance, the college had been negligent and was, thus, liable to pay the compensation amount of ₹25 lakh, it was argued.\nThe High Court, however, said that no one could be blamed for the voluntary act of the deceased student. It said that the present case was not one of \"absolute negligence\" on the part of the authorities but that of a \"milder form of negligence.\" \nIt said that the Court could not accept that a 21-year-old student was was unaware of the consequences of jumping into the sea. \n\"The risk element involved would have been considered by the student before jumping into the sea. Thus, he has accepted the consequences voluntarily. The voluntary acceptance of risk exonerates the organisers from liability and responsibility,\" the Court ruled.\nAdvocate M Radhakrishnan appeared for the petitioner. \nSenior Central Government Panel Counsel M Arvind Kumar appeared for the Union of India, a respondent in the case. \nAdditional Advocate General P Kumaresan and advocate T Arun Kumar appeared for the respondents Tamil Nadu government and the Kancheepuram district collector. \nAdditional Government Pleader V Meenakshi Sundaram appeared for respondents Anna University and the University's NSS programme coordinator. \nAdvocate M Arun Kumar appeared for the Indian Maritime Foundation.\nAdvocate G Saravanan appeared for the chairperson and the principal of the respondent engineering College."}
{"ID": "id_875", "Summary": "The Delhi High Court recently dismissed a plea challenging the provisions of the Delhi Motor Vehicles Rules and permit conditions which make it mandatory for the drivers of taxis and auto rickshaws to wear uniforms and badges [Chaalak Shakti & Ors v Govt of NCT of Delhi & Ors].\nA Division Bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice Subramonium Prasad observed that specific powers have been given to the Central and State governments to lay down conditions subject to which permits can be given.\nThe bench made it clear that the argument that the power of prescribing uniform for drivers of auto rickshaws and taxis is per se arbitrary and violative of Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution cannot be accepted.\n“The purpose of prescribing a uniform is for identification. The fact that there are different shades available in the same colour and, therefore, this leads to vagueness and is manifestly arbitrary also cannot be accepted,” the Court said.\nThe Bench was dealing with a plea filed by an organisation of drivers, Chaalak Shakti challenging Rule 7 of DMV Rules, 1993 as well as permit conditions as notified in SO 415(E) issued on June 8, 1989 under section 88(11)(ii) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988.\nRule 7 of the DMV Rules prescribes that while on duty, driver of a public service vehicle, other than State Transports Undertaking, shall wear khaki uniforms with a name plate in Hindi affixed on it.\nThe permit conditions notified in 1989 stated that drivers of tourist vehicles shall wear white uniform in summers and blue or grey in winters.\nIt was argued that there was lack of clarity about the colour of the uniform, fabric, details of trimming and accessories and whether the uniform should be pant-shirts, safari suits or kurta-pajamas.\nThe petitioners also contended that forcing the drivers of autos and taxis to wear uniform amounted to an affront to the constitutional freedom under Article 14 (right to equality), 19 (freedom to carry on trade or profession) and 21 (right to life) of the Constitution.\nAfter considering the case, the Bench said that “the competence of Central governments to issue notifications under Section 88 of the MV Act for tourist vehicles and the competence of State government to lay down rules for uniform to be worn by drivers of transport vehicles in Delhi by exercising its powers under Section 28 of the DMV Rules cannot be questioned”.\nThe Court concluded that there is no reason to strike down the Rule or the permit condition and therefore, the petition was dismissed. \n\"The colour and the description of the uniform for the drivers of vehicles running within the State is prescribed under Rule 7 of the DMV Rules (Delhi Motor Vehicles Rules) and the colour and the uniform as specified in SO No 415 E dated 08.06.1989 which has been issued under Section 88(11) (ii) of the MV Act (Motor Vehicle Act) are specific and there is no ambiguity.\"\nAdvocates Aman Agarwal and Madhav Bhatia appeared for the petitioners. \nDelhi government was represented by its Standing Counsel, Santosh Kumar Tripathi and advocates Arun Panwar, Pradyumn Rao, Mehak Rankawat and Karthik Sharma. \nSenior Central Government Counsel TP Singh appeared for the Union of India."}
{"ID": "id_878", "Summary": "The Delhi High Court today ruled the Delhi government's Chief Minister Advocates’ Welfare Scheme must be extended to all lawyers registered with the Bar Council of Delhi (BCD) irrespective of whether their place of residence is in Delhi or the surrounding National Capital Region (NCR). (Govind Swaroop Chaturvedi and ors v. State of NCT of Delhi and ors, Bar Council of Delhi v. Govt NCT of Delhi and ors)\nJustice Prathiba Singh held that the insistence on a voter ID showing residence in Delhi to avail the welfare scheme is discriminatory, arbitrary and has no link to the object of the scheme. \n1. The condition in the scheme that it would be applicable only to residents of Delhi with voter IDs is discriminatory and arbitrary. It has no rational link to the object. The scheme will be extended to all advocates registered with BCD whose names and credentials are verified without insistence on voter ID showing residence in Delhi\n2. For current year, all advocates registered for benefits under the scheme would be extended the benefits. Government of National Capital of Territory of Delhi (GNCTD) has spent approximately Rs 40 crores, the Court recorded. 5,044 Delhi lawyers from NCR region for whom premium has been paid (but who were hitherto left out from the scheme) will enjoy scheme. All such advocates who have registered within the deadline and who were left out would be covered for remainder of the year.\n3. In future years, there may be more lawyers eligible for the scheme and the total premium for life insurance and mediclaim may be too much for GNCTD to solely bear the burden, although it is urged that the amount set out for the scheme may be increased. The BCD ought to complement the efforts of GNCTD. The deficit on year to year basis which is beyond GNCTD’s capacity/ budgeted amount shall be funded by BCD. To this end, BCD may utilise its own funds, including funds collected under the Advocates Welfare Act, or pool voluntary contributions from willing lawyers or collect some part of the amount from beneficiaries. The Law Secretary to the GNCTD and the BCD chairman are to work out the modalities for this and appoint nodal officers for the same.\nJustice Prathiba Singh observed that there may be lawyers who practice primarily in Delhi, but have their permanent residence elsewhere. It was further noted that all may not be able to reside in the metropolitan area of Delhi due to financial constraints and may, therefore, choose to reside in NCR while practicing in Delhi.\nShe further highlighted that a conjoint reading of the Advocates' Act, the BCD Rules and the relevant Bar Council of India (BCI) rules reveals that an advocate is entitled to register in the place where s/he intends to primarily practice. Once a lawyer is enrolled with the Bar Council of the area where s/he is practicing, the rules of that Bar Council govern the lawyer. None of these rules give importance to the place of residence of the advocate. The address is only a means of information, which is not set in stone and can be changed after due intimation to the Bar Council, it was pointed out.\nAs such, the place of residence of the advocate does not affect the status of the advocate or take away the right of the advocate to practice in a particular jurisdiction, Justice Singh held.\nCoupled with this, the Court noted that Delhi enjoys a unique position, especially when it comes to the practice of law. In this regard, it was pointed out that the Supreme Court, various specialised forums, and a vast amount of commercial litigation before Delhi High Court and Delhi courts may attract lawyers from all over the country. Justice Singh noted that there were families who arrived after partition, people who have migrated due to employment compulsions and first generation lawyers who come to Delhi. The Bar is also cosmopolitan and has accepted lawyers from all over India with an open heart, Justice Singh commented.\nPertinently, Justice Singh went on to emphasise that the CM Welfare Scheme is centered around the professional contributions of advocates, not their role as voters in Delhi. Lawyers practicing in Delhi and registered with BCD, but residing in NCR, have also contributed to the administration of Justice in Delhi, it was observed. There is no link between the possession of a voter ID showing residence in Delhi and the stated object of the scheme, Justice Singh found.\nIn November last year, Chief Minister of Delhi, Arvind Kejriwal had announced that a 13-member committee of lawyers would be set up to make recommendations on the utilization of the Rs. 50 crore earmarked for the Advocates Welfare Fund by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government.\nIn December 2019, the Advocates Committee set up under the convenership of the then-Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) President, Rakesh Khanna proposed rolling out Group (Term) Insurance, Group Medi-Claim, e-library and creche for advocates in Delhi towards the utilization of the Chief Minister’s Advocates Welfare Scheme.\nThe scheme was approved by the Delhi government earlier this year. The scheme provides several benefits to Delhi lawyers, including Group (Term) Insurance, Group Medi-Claim, e-library, and creche for advocates in Delhi.\nIn March this year, the present petition to extend this scheme to lawyers residing in NCR, but practicing in Delhi, was filed. \nDuring pendency of petition 28,744 lawyers were issued Life Insurance policies by LIC and 29,077 lawyers got medi-claim from New India Assurance Company Limited (NIACL)."}
{"ID": "id_88", "Summary": "Maharashtra Legislative Assembly member Nitesh Rane has moved the Bombay High Court seeking bail after a court in Sindhudurg, Maharashtra rejected his plea for bail in an attempt to murder case.\nThe Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLA, who is son of Union Minister Narayan Rane, is accused of being the main conspirator behind the attempt on the life of a Shiv Sena member in an incident which allegedly took place on December 18, 2021, in the Kankavli region of Maharashtra.\nHis bail application through advocate Satish Maneshinde underscored that \"this is a classic case of political vendetta or rivalry at the behest of the ruling dispensation against the applicant and his father.\"\nHe prayed for bail on the following grounds:\nThat the FIR was registered with the sole aim of preventing Rane's participation in the Sindhudurg Co-operative Bank district elections that were to be held on December 30, 2021;\nThat the prime controversy in the case was the recent \"incident of cat-calling\" outside Vidhan Bhawan, which involved State Cabinet Minister Aditya Thackeray, son of Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray;\nThat in compliance with the Supreme Court order, he had surrendered before the Sessions Court;\nThat the complainant in the present case, a Shiv Sena party worker, was campaigning with Rane's rival candidate in the district bank elections, which implied that the case was borne out of political vendetta and involved false implication;\nThat there is nothing on record to suggest that he will abuse liberty if enlarged on bail;\nThat he has strong roots in the society with no likelihood to abscond or flee away from justice;\nThat there is a third wave of COVID pandemic especially in Maharashtra, hence custody would be prejudicial to his health.\nThe present bail application was filed after the District and Sessions Court at Sindhudurg rejected his bail plea today.\nThis was the second time the Sindhudurg Court refused him relief; the first being Rane's anticipatory bail application.\nAfter Rane's anticipatory bail plea was rejected, he had approached the High Court with an anticipatory bail application which was also rejected on January 17.\nWhile doing so, it had extended the assurance given by the Maharashtra government that no coercive action would be taken against Rane till January 27, 2022. Aggrieved by this order, Rane approached the Supreme Court in appeal.\nThe Supreme Court granted him protection from arrest for 10 days with direction to surrender before the concerned court and apply for bail. Accordingly Rane approached the Sindhudurg Sessions Court for bail.\nIn the 19-page order rejecting his bail plea, Additional Sessions Judge RB Rote noted that there had been no substantial change in circumstances since rejection of anticipatory bail. \nRelying upon the Supreme Court order, the judge deduced that \"custodial interrogation of the applicant is necessary for proper and effective investigation of the case\". \nThe reasons were as follows:\nTwo accused in the case are still absconding;\nThere is possibility of economic dealing/exchange of money;\n11 criminal cases are shown to be registered against the applicant including offence against public servants;\nIf the applicant is granted bail, the investigation will be hampered; and\nRane's application for regular bail was premature as there was no accompanying written application for surrender.\nIn view of these reasons, his bail plea was rejected."}

{"ID": "id_886", "Summary": "The Supreme Court on Wednesday struck down the Maharashtra State Reservation for Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) Act, 2018 which extends reservation to the Maratha community in public education and employment (Jaishri Laxmanrao Patil v. Chief Minister).\nThe Court said that there were no extraordinary circumstances to grant reservation to Maratha community over and above the 50 percent ceiling on reservation prescribed by the Supreme Court in its 1992 judgment in Indra Sawhney v. Union of India. \n\"The 2018 Act as amended in 2019 granting reservation for Maratha community does not make out any exceptional circumstance to exceed the ceiling limit of 50 percent reservation,\" the Court held. \nThe Act of 2018 violates the principles of equality and exceeding ceiling limit of 50 percent clearly violates Articles 14 and 15 of the Constitution, the Court added. \nIn the process the Court also ruled that the judgment in Indra Sawhney v. Union of India need not be referred to larger Bench and the 50 percent ceiling on reservation laid down in Indra Sawhney is good law.\n\"We do not find any substance in the argument to refer the judgment in Indra Sawhney to a larger Bench. The said judgment has been repeatedly followed by this Court and has received approved by at least four Constitution Benches of this Court. We also follow and reiterate the proposition laid down in Indra Sawhney in paragraph 809 and 810,\" the Court made it clear. \nThe Court further said that neither the Gaikwad Commission report nor the judgment of the Bombay High Court has made out an extraordinary situation in the case of Marathas so as to exceed the ceiling of 50 percent. \n\"Conclusions of the commission are unsustainable. There is no case of extraordinary situation for exceeding the ceiling limit of 50 percent for grant of reservation to Marathas over and above the 50 percent,\" the Court emphasised. \nThe judgment was delivered by a Constitution bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan, L Nageswara Rao, S Abdul Nazeer, Hemant Gupta and S Ravindra Bhat.\nThe judgments on the above aspects was unanimous. \nHowever, the Bench differed on the interpretation of Article 342A of the Constitution which was inserted by 102nd Constitutional Amendment. \nArticle 342A calls for the identification of communities in States as socially and educationally backward classes by the President, in consultation with the Governor of the state.\nThe question before the Court was whether the said Article deprived the States of the power to classify any community as SEBC. \nJustices Bhushan and Nazeer took the view that by Article 342A, the parliament did not intend to take away the power of States to identify backward classes. They upheld the 102nd Constitutional amendment which inserted Article 342A. \nHowever, Justice Rao, Bhat and Gupta held that under Article 342A, the President alone is empowered to identify SEBC and notify in the list. States can only make suggestions for inclusion of SEBC in that list.\nHowever, they too upheld the 102nd Amendment. \nThe following is the operative part of the judgment:\n- Appeals challenging the Bombay High Court judgment are allowed. The impugned judgment of the High Court is set aside.\n- Section 2(j) of the Act insofar as it declares Maratha community as -Educationally and Socially Backward category is held to be ultra vires the Constitution and is struck down.\n- Section 4(1)(a) of the Act insofar as it grants reservation under Article 15(4) to the extent of 12 percent of the total seats in educational institutions including private institutions whether aided or unaided other than minority institutions is declared ultra vires the Constitution and is struck down.\n- Section 4(1)(b) of the Act granting reservation upto 13 percent for Maratha community in total appointment in direct recruitment with respect to public services and posts under the State is held to be ultra vires the Constitution and struck down.\n- Admissions to post graduate courses which were already held up till the interim order of the Supreme Court in September 9, 2020 will not to be affected by the judgment. Hence, those who have already been admitted in post graduate courses till then shall be allowed to continue.\n- All appointments made to public services in favour of Maratha community after the judgment of the High Court till interim order of the Supreme Court on September 9, 2020 are saved.\n- Challenge to 102nd Constitutional Amendment dismissed.\nThe Act\nThe Maharashtra State Reservation for Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) Act, which enacted providing for 16 percent reservation for the Maratha community in educational institutions and government employment.\nThe Act came to be challenged before the Bombay High Court by the petitioners as being a fraud on the Constitution of India, as it proposed to hike the reservation in Maharashtra from 52 percent to 68 percent. This, it was contended, was in violation of the Supreme Court’s judgment in Indra Sawhney v. Union of India.\nIt was further contended that after the Constitution (102nd Amendment) Act which came into force with effect from August 2018, the State legislature is denuded of its power to declare a particular class to be socially and educationally backward.\nArticle 342A calls for the identification of communities in States as socially and educationally backward classes by the President, in consultation with the Governor of the state.\nBombay High Court judgment\nThe Bombay High Court upheld the validity of the law while ruling that Indra Sawhney does not impose any State’s power to exceed reservation more than 50% in a deserving case. Extraordinary circumstance warrant exceeding of the 50 percent cap on reservation in the State, the Bench held.\nThe Court also held that 102nd Amendment by which Article 342A was inserted does not deprive State of its powers to specify the socially and educationally backward classes in the list prepared by the State.\nThe High Court ruled that the restriction under Article 342A is applicable only to the list prepared by the Central government.\n\"The existence of central list of backward classes is distinct from the list of the State which is prepared by the State for translating the enabling power conferred on it and in any contingency, Article 342-A cannot be read to control the enabling power conferred on the State under Article 15 and 16,” the High Court said. \nAppeal before Supreme Court \nAppeals were filed before the Supreme Court against the High Court verdict. In July 2019, the Supreme Court issued notice to State of Maharashtra in the appeals.\nIn September 2020, a three-judge Bench referred the matter to a Constitution Bench taking into account the Constitutional issues involved in the matter. \nOn March 8, 2021, the top court decided to hear all States in the matter, after Senior Counsel Mukul Rohtagi, Kapil Sibal and Dr. AM Singhvi contended that the case involves issue which impacts all States since any judgment in the matter could impact the powers of the State to extend reservation to socially and educationally backward classes.\nThis was also supported by Attorney General KK Venugopal.\nIssues heard by the Supreme Court\nFinal hearings in the matter had commenced on March 15, 2021 and the hearing last for ten days before the Court reserved its judgment on March 26.\nThe following legal issues were heard by the Court:\n- Whether judgment in case of Indra Sawhney v.

{"ID": "id_887", "Summary": "The Jharkhand High Court on Wednesday refused to grant permission for former Jharkhand Chief Minister Hemant Soren, who is presently in jail after his recent arrest in a money laundering case, to participate in the ongoing Budget Session of the State legislature [Hemant Soren v. Directorate of Enforcement].\nJustice Sujit Narayan Prasad reasoned that a person who is in custody on the basis of a valid order will have to forgo his right to participate in the business of the legislature.\nThe Court also rejected the argument that the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha-led government in the State would collapse if Soren, a member of the legislative assembly, was prevented from participating in the Session.\nThe Court pointed out that such irreparable loss would only be there if the voting strength of the ruling and opposing party are neck-to-neck.\n“Then in such cases probability is there of non-passing of the budget leading to loss of confidence in government which will have adverse impact across the State,” Justice Prasad noted.\nIn the present case, however, the Court was told that these numbers are not neck-to-neck. Rather, it was submitted that the number of legislative assembly members in Jharkhand on the ruling side is 47 and in opposition, it is 29.\nSoren had stepped down as Chief Minister of Jharkhand on January 31 in the wake of his arrest by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in a money laundering case related to the “illegal change of ownership of land by the mafia” in Jharkhand.\nHe had moved the High Court challenging the trial court's refusal to permit him to participate in the Budget Session which began on February 23 and will culminate on March 2.\nAfter hearing the arguments made by Soren and ED, the Court considered the question of whether participation in the Budget Session can be said to be a fundamental right in light of Article 19(1)(a) and Article 194 of the Constitution.\nIt noted the fundamental right to freedom of speech under Article 19 is distinct from Article 194 which grants “absolute” freedom of speech to legislators within the legislative chamber.\nIt proceeded to conclude that there is no violation of a fundamental right in not permitting Soren to participate in the Budget Session. \n“Since the ‘right to speech’ as guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution of India has been held to be distinct over Article 105 and 194 of the Constitution of India, therefore, merely because one or the other Member of Parliament or Member of State Legislative Assembly is not being allowed to participate in the proceeding due to the valid detention after valid order of remand the same cannot be construed to be in violation of Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution of India,” the Court explained.\nThe Court also considered whether it would be just to allow Soren to participate in the Budget Session under a ‘vested right’, when serious allegations of money laundering have been levelled against him.\nIt opined that if no legal proceedings were pending against Soren, then certainly in the capacity of being a people’s representative, his right to participate in the Budget Session would have been a vested legal right.\nHowever, since the order of remand has not been challenged by Soren, Justice Prasad concluded that “it cannot be said that any legal vested right has accrued to the petitioner to participate in the proceeding of the floor.”\nThe Court also said that the ‘right to vote’ and ‘right to contest’ in elections are on the same level as a ‘right to participate in the session.'\nIn former cases (where the right to vote or contest is affected) appropriate orders could have been passed to allow lawmakers to participate in the Session for the purpose of voting or taking an oath, it added.\nIn conclusion, the Court said that in wake of Soren's valid custody, it would be totally inappropriate to exercise its discretion under Article 226 of the Constitution of India to grant him the permission to attend the assembly session solely on grounds that he has the freedom of speech or that he enjoys privilege in the assembly or on the ground that he has to participate in the proceedings to meet Constitutional obligations.\nSenior Advocates Kapil Sibal and Rajiv Ranjan with advocates Piyush Chitresh and Shray Mishra represented Hemant Soren.\nAdditional Solicitor General SV Raju and advocates Zoheb Hossain, Amit Kumar Das, Saurav Kumar and Risabh Dubey represented the ED."}
{"ID": "id_888", "Summary": "The Allahabad High Court on Thursday remarked that a scientific survey of the Gyanvapi Mosque premises by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) would be advantageous for Hindu and Muslim parties and would also assist the trial court in arriving at a fair and just decision. [C/M Anjuman Intezamia Masajid Varanasi v. Rakhi Singh & 8 Ors]\nThe Court made the observation while dismissing a plea filed by the Muslim party challenging a Varanasi court order allowing the ASI to conduct a scientific survey of the Gyanvapi Mosque premises.\nThe matter concerns disputed claims over whether the structure found on the premises of the Gyanvapi Mosque during that earlier survey was a Shivling, as claimed by the Hindu parties in the case.\nNotably, the Muslim side has moved an appeal before the Supreme Court this afternoon challenging the High Court's decision to allow the ASI scientific survey to proceed. \nIn the order passed earlier today, Chief Justice Pritinker Diwaker opined that a scientific survey is important in this case, in the interest of justice.\n\"In the opinion of the Court, the scientific survey/investigation proposed to be carried out by the Commission, is necessary in the interest of justice and shall benefit the plaintiffs and defendants alike and come in aid of the trial court to arrive at a just decision,\" the order stated.\nThe Court added that when the Department of Archaeology assured that no harm would be inflicted upon the property, the Court has no grounds to question its assertions.\nIt further opined that the survey exercise can be done without having to dig any wall at the disputed site, contrary to the assertions of the Muslim side. \nThe Chief Justice noted that there have been technological advances that could guide the ASI in its scientific investigation. \nThe Court also recorded the submission made by the Additional Solicitor General of India that no excavation will take place. As such, the Court found no substance in the argument of the Muslim side things cannot be finalised by the ASI without digging any wall. \nOn this aspect, the Court took on record the ASI's submission it will not carry out any excavation and that no demolition or alteration of the property's existing structure will take place during the survey. \nConsidering the prolonged nature of the case, Chief Justice Diwaker finally requested the court dealing with the suit to expedite case proceedings. \n\"As the proceeding of Suit has been lingering on for long, it would be appropriate to observe that the Court concerned shall make all endeavor to conclude the proceedings expeditiously, without granting unnecessary adjournments to either of the parties by giving short dates,\" the High Court directed.\nWith this, the High Court dismissed the plea to halt the proposed ASI survey of the Gyanvapi Mosque premises. The earlier stay order was vacated and the Varanasi district court order for the ASI survey was restored. \nThe High Court had reserved its verdict on this issue on July 27, after the Supreme Court stayed the district court order for the survey. The top court's order of stay was passed in order to allow the High Court to hear the appeal moved by the Muslim side challenging the district court order. \nThe order under challenge was passed on July 21 by Varanasi district court judge AK Vishwesha.\nEarlier, a civil court ordered a survey of the Mosque alone by an advocate commissioner, who then videotaped the premises and submitted a report to the civil court in May 2022.\nLater, on October 14, 2022, a district court passed an order rejecting a plea for scientific investigation to ascertain whether the object was a Shivling or a fountain.\nHowever, the Allahabad High Court on May 12 held that a scientific investigation can be done to ascertain whether the object was a Shivling or a fountain, without damaging the object.\nDays later, the Supreme Court temporarily deferred the High Court's direction while seeking the responses of the Central and State governments to the appeal filed by a Muslim party challenging such a direction.\nThis matter is presently pending before the top court.\nHowever, the district court, on July 21, ordered an ASI survey of the mosque premises excluding the area previously sealed by the Supreme Court (wuzukhana or an ablution pond).\nThis order has now been upheld by the High Court.\nSenior Advocate SFA Naqvi and Advocates Puneet Kumar Gupta, Syed Ahmed Faizan, Zaheer Asghar, Ms Fatma Anjum, Munnaur Hussain, Mumtaz Ahmad, Akhlaq Ahmad, Mehmood Alam, Poorva Agarwal, Vipul Dubey and Devendra Mishra represented the Muslim side. \nAdvocates Ajay Mishra, Ashok Mehta, MC Chaturvedi, Kunal Ravi Singh, Vijay Shanker Mishra, Ishan Mehta, Ankit Gaur, Hare Ram Tripathi, Manoj Kumar Mishra, and Ishan Dev Giri appeared for the State.\nAdvocates Shashi Prakash Singh, Manoj Kumar Singh and Purnendu Kumar Singh appeared for the Union of India.\nAdvocates Vishnu Shanker Jain, Prabhash Pandey, Saurabh Tiwari and Vineet Sankalp appeared for the Hindu side."}

Once this position is accepted, no error can be attributed to the final decisions rendered by the Speaker,\" the 89-page order stated.\nThe petitions were filed by Congress MLA Girish Chodankar and MGP MLA Sudin Dhavalikar.\nThe factual matrix in Chodankar's plea was that 10 members claiming to be two- thirds of the legislative party of Congress in the assembly, decided to join the BJP in July 2019. The speaker, accordingly, allotted them seats along with BJP members.\nChodankar instituted a petition seeking disqualification of the members as they had voluntarily given up membership of their original party, Congress.\nAfter a preliminary enquiry and examination of written statements by the members, the speaker dismissed the petition on April 24, 2021.\nThe speaker observed that since two-third members of Congress decided to merge with the BJP, the deeming fiction operated as per paragraph 4(2) of the Tenth Schedule, thus saving the members from disqualification.\nMeanwhile in Dhavalikar's plea, 2 members from the regional party voluntarily gave up membership claiming they had merged with BJP. \nThis grievance was raised by Dhavalikar before the Speaker, who dismissed the disqualification petition on April 20, 2021 on the ground that there was a deemed merger of the MGP with the BJP and hence, no disqualification could happen.\nThe petitioners challenged the orders in the High Court raising the question of political morality and whether the orders passed by the speaker are in furtherance of the object with which the Tenth Schedule was introduced in the Constitution.\nThe Tenth Schedule was a law brought in to limit the frequent defections of members of a political party to another political party.\nThe Bench opined that split of a political party as it existed and merger of the original political party with another political party are distinct concepts and not to be confused with each other. \n\"As long as Parliament in its wisdom has determined the threshold of morality of at least two-thirds members of the legislature party agreeing for merger, the Courts have nothing else to go by, except the legislative wisdom of the parliament to determine such a threshold of political morality in that context,\" the Bench stated in its order. \nThe Court stated that as long as the specific condition of not less than two-thirds members of the legislature party agreeing to merge is satisfied, it is politically and Constitutionally moral to protect the member of the House from disqualification.\nPolls to elect the new 40-member Goa Assembly were held on February 14 this year and the counting votes will be done on March 10."}
{"ID": "id_890", "Summary": "The Delhi High Court on Friday rejected an interim application filed by BharatPe co-founder Shashvat Nakrani to restrain the firm's former Managing Director Ashneer Grover from selling or alienating the shares that Nakrani sold to him [Shashvat Nakrani v Ashneer Grover]\nJustice Sachin Datta dismissed the application but asked Grover to give an intimation to the Court when he decides to sell or transfer the shares in question. \nIn a detailed judgement, the Court said that there was no merit in the case set up by Nakrani.\nJustice Datta noted that it was evident that the shares were transferred to Grover and his name being recorded as a shareholder of BharatPe was done pursuant to the approval of the Board of Directors or a duly constituted committee of the said board.\nThe Bench noted that subsequent to the transfer of shares, 16 agreements were entered into where both Nakrani and Grover sold their shareholding to external investors which led to ₹4,500 crores being infused in BharatPe and Nakrani was paid a personal consideration of nearly ₹40 crores by various external investors.\n“Admittedly, in all these agreements, to which both the plaintiff and the defendant were parties, the defendant was represented to be as a shareholder of the concerned company. It is completely untenable for the plaintiff to suggest that the defendant was wrongly portrayed as a shareholder in all these agreements or that the plaintiff was “induced” to sign these agreements,” the Court said.\nIt rejected Nakrani’s arguments that title in the concerned shares never passed to Grover on account of non-payment of consideration and, therefore, it was permissible to repudiate the contract for sale of shares.\nJustice Datta also noted a “direct and utter” contradiction in the pleadings in the present suit and the suit filed by BharatPe where the company sought to recover nearly ₹88 crores from Ashneer Grover and his family members who were associated with BharatPe.\nThe Bench recorded that in the other suit, BharatPe had said that Grover “became a shareholder” of BharatPe by “contributing a paltry sum of ₹31,920”.\nTherefore, the Court concluded that this aspect also disentitled Nakrani from any interim relief.\nIt was Nakrani's case that he had transferred his shares to Grover and while the latter claimed to have paid for them in cash, the money was never received. \nAccording to a report in Mint, BharatPe was founded by Shashvat Nakrani and Bhavik Koladiya in March 2018 with each owning 50% in the firm. Ashneer Grover joined the company as a third co-founder and board member in July 2018, and purchased 3,192 shares (2,447 from Nakrani and 745 from Koladiya for ₹10 apiece).\nThe same report claimed that Grover was to pay ₹24,470 to Nakrani and ₹7,450 to Koladiya, however, Grover is yet to pay for the shares.\nMint report revealed that after the shares split, the 2,447 shares are now 24,470 shares. \nPeople familiar with the matter say that the shares in question are worth ₹500 crore now. \nAdvocate Giriraj Subramanium appeared for Grover and argued that Nakrani's case is based on complete \"misreading, misinterpretation and misunderstanding of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930\". \nHe said that the transfer of shares to Grover, permitting him to join and remain a member of BharatPe for nearly five years showed that Nakrani not only delivered the shares to the defendant on July 2, 2018 but also never reserved any right of disposal whatsoever. \nSubramanium further contended that in the present case, the contract has been performed in its entirety, the share transfer form has been executed and Grover's name has been entered into the register of shareholder. \nThis makes it evident that the title to the shares have passed to the Grover, he submitted. \nBharatPe's other co-founder, Bhavik Koladiya has also sued Grover over the disputes regarding the transfer of shares. \nAccording to media reports, Koladiya (the largest shareholder in the company) had to leave BharatPe allegedly because his past conviction in the United States in a credit card fraud case was hindering talks with investors.\nAs he resigned, Koladiya transferred his shares to Grover, Nakrani and one Mansukhbhai Mohanbhai Nakrani, as well as some other early-stage and angel investors.\nThe consideration for the transfer of the shares was approximately ₹88 lakh. He has claimed that till date, Grover has not paid the purchase consideration."}

{"ID": "id_892", "Summary": "The Supreme Court on Monday held that gangster Abu Salem convicted in the 1993 Bombay blasts case has to be released by the Central government upon completion of 25 years imprisonment as per the terms of an extradition treaty between India and Portugal [Abu Salem v. State of Maharashtra].\nA Bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and MM Sundresh held that the Court cannot commute the sentence as was prayed for, but Central government is bound exercise its remission powers to release Salem as per the treaty.\n\"On the appellant completing 25 years of sentence, the Central Government is bound to advice the President of India for exercise of his powers under Article 72 of the Constitution, and to release the appellant in terms of the national commitment as well as the principle based on comity of courts. In view thereof, the necessary papers be forwarded within a month of the period of completion of 25 years sentence of the appellant. In fact, the Government can itself exercise this power in terms of Sections 432 and 433 of the CrPC,\" the Court held.\nOn the completion of 25 years, the Central government is to advise the President of India to release Salem, the Court added.\nIt added that such an exercise must be completed within a month of completion of the sentence, reasoning that \"there is a necessity of making this time bound so that it does not result in an unending exercise\".\nThe Court, however, made it clear that it cannot commute or restrict the period of sentence.\n\"We do believe that looking into the grievousness of the offence in which the appellant was involved, there is no question for this Court exercising any special privileges to commute or restrict the period of sentence of the appellant. In fact, different States in India have followed different patterns before even a case for remission is considered,\" the judgment said. \nThe Court also made it clear that Salem's detention period in Portugal in relation to a passport fraud case cannot be considered as part of the 25-year term. \n\"It cannot be lost sight that when reference is made in a set off for adjustment of periods, the reference is to proceedings within the country. The criminal law of the land does not have any extra-territorial application. Thus, what happens in another country for some other trial, some other detention, in our view, would not be relevant for the purposes of the proceedings in the country. The factual scenario is that the appellant was charged with having a fake passport. He was found guilty and convicted of sentence from 18.09.2002. This had nothing to do with the proceedings against him in India,\" the judgment noted.\nSalem had claimed that the 2017 judgment of a Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act (TADA) Court sentencing him to life imprisonment was against the terms of treaty between India and Portugal.\nOver the course of the hearing, the top court had questioned why the plea was raised two months before the completion of 25 years.\nSalem had also argued that the period of imprisonment must be considered from the date of detention in Portugal after the issuance of the Red Corner Notice (non-bailable warrants) and not from the date of completion of extradition by India.\nOn December 17, 2002, that Government of India had given an assurance to the Government of Portugal that if Salem is extradited for trial in India, he would neither be given the death penalty nor would he be subjected to imprisonment for a term beyond 25 years, Salem's plea stated.\nIt was argued that regardless of the fact that the TADA Court had held that it was not bound by the assurances of the government, the top court indeed has the power to rule on the same and grant relief.\nThe plea was opposed by the Central government through Additional Solicitor General KM Nataraj, who submitted that the period undergone by Salem as an undertrial in Portugal for a case related to passport fraud cannot be considered for computation of 25 years of imprisonment.\nAfter a long-drawn extradition battle with Portugal, Salem was brought to India in 2005 and sentenced to life imprisonment for his role in the 1993 blasts that rocked Mumbai.\nLast year, the Supreme Court had refused to entertain a plea filed by the gangster claiming that his extradition to India was illegal.\nThe Central government had informed the Supreme Court that it was bound by the assurance it gave to Portugal and would abide by it at an appropriate time, but the plea by Salem was premature. Salem's attempt to club the merits of the case with the assurance was legally untenable, it was stated in the affidavit.\nAdvocates Rishi Malhotra appeared for the appellant."}

Lakshminarayanan had challenged the charge memo issued during the disciplinary proceedings against him for posting the objectionable messages on the WhatsApp group on July 29. \nThe Court said the management could not take action against its employees for messages posted on WhatsApp groups as long as such messages were not in clear breach of any existing laws.\n\"There is something called “right to vent”. Every employee or a member of an organization will have some issue or the other with the management. To nurture a sense of grievance is quite natural. It is in the interest of the organization that the complaints find expression and ventilation. It will have a cathartic effect. If in the process, the image of the organization is affected, then the management can step in but not till then,” the Court said.\nThe Court further said that though a government employee, who is bound by prescribed rules of conduct, cannot claim the same rights as a private citizen, it does not take away his fundamental right of free speech and expression guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution. \n“The common law principle is “everyman's home is his castle”. If bar room gossip is published, that would definitely attract contempt of Court. But then, so long as it remains private, cognizance cannot be taken. The world has become a global village. It is connected by digital technology. The principles applicable to a chat in a home can be applied to what takes place in an encrypted virtual platform that has restricted access. Such an approach alone will be in consonance with liberal democratic traditions. We are yet to enter into the worlds envisaged by Aldous Huxley in “Brave New World” and George Orwell in “1984”. What the respondent proposes amounts to thought-policing,” the Court said.\nWhile quashing the charge memo, the Court also noted that Lakshminarayanan had merely expressed his right to vent and had also readily apologised when it had been pointed out that his messages were in bad taste."}

[Peerzada Shah Fahad v. UT of J&K and Anr]\nA division bench of Justice Atul Sreedharan and Justice Mohan Lal (who retired last week) said if the argument were accepted, it would literally turn the criminal law on its head and penalise any criticism of the government.\n“It would mean that any criticism of the central government can be described as a terrorist act because the honour of India is its incorporeal property. Such a proposition would collide head long with the fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression enshrined in Article 19 of the Constitution,” it said.\nThe Court made the observations in its order granting bail to The Kashmir Walla editor Fahad Shah. \nThe observations were in response to an argument made by the prosecution while opposing the bail plea of The Kashmir Walla editor Fahad Shah. \nThe journalist has been booked in a UAPA case by J&K’s anti-terror State Investigation Agency (SIA) for allegedly publishing articles advocating secession of Jammu and Kashmir.\nDuring the hearing, when the Court asked the State to justify how Section 15 of the UAPA (terrorist act) applies in the facts of the case, the Senior Additional Advocate General referred to Section 15(1)(a)(aa) of the UAPA that makes an act resulting in the loss, damage or destruction of property, a terrorist act.\nExplaining the contention, the State said the property as defined under the UAPA can be both corporeal (that actually exists) or incorporeal (that does not have physical existence). \nThus, it was submitted that honour, dignity and fair name of India was its “incorporeal” property.\nThe article published  by Shah besmirched the \"property\" as it levelled “baseless allegations against the Government of India of indulging in genocide, committing rape of the women of Kashmir by its armed forces and other outrageous conduct which had the propensity to lower the image of India in the eyes of the world”, submitted the State counsel.\nHowever, the Court rejected the argument and said the basic rule of the criminal law and criminal statutes is that it must be unambiguous, unequivocal and clear as day when it makes an act an offence.\nIt added that before the concept put forth by the State’s counsel can be accepted, the legislature would have to make the act of expressing any disparaging thought of India, a specific offence. \n“The average Indian in the street who must suffer the consequences must be made well aware beforehand that his negative opinion of India, expressed in words or in writing or any other form giving permanence, could visit him with severe sanction,” the Court observed.\nOn the definition of 'property', the Court said even otherwise the property referred to in Section 15(1)(a)(ii) must be such that it is susceptible to destruction or loss by use of means like explosives or firearms. \nThe Court concluded that property that can suffer damage, loss or destruction can only be a material or corporeal property. \n“An incorporeal property would be impervious to damage and destruction by the use of means mentioned in s. 15(1)(a). Therefore, the argument put forth by the Ld. Sr. AAG is rejected,” it added.\nThe High Court last week granted bail to Shah in the case and observed that in matters concerning bail of accused under the UAPA, the investigating agency making the arrest under the Act would have to justify the arrest on the ground of “clear and present danger” which the accused person poses to the society.\nSenior Advocate PN Raina and Advocate JA Hamal represented the petitioner\nSenior Additional Advocate Generals Monika Kohli and Mohsin Qadri represented the State"}

Thus, the state government as well as private educational institutions can no longer hold entrance exams for medical courses.\"\nThe petition further pointed out that the apex court had asked the Central government to frame a uniform policy on compulsory government service as many States had no such service. In this light, the petitioner contended that the State cannot impose such service as such a power is now vested only with the NMC.\nThe plea further questioned the validity of the notification dated February 15, 2021, issued by the Directorate of Medical Education, directing colleges to withhold all original documents of students who have completed their medical courses.\nThe documents are important to apply for the graduate National Eligibility-Cum-Entrance to joint postgraduate medical courses, said the petitioners.

[SK Basavarajan v State of Karnataka]\nJustice R Devdas observed that if magistrates do not read complaints and FIRs, and go about passing orders mechanically, the first line of defence would naturally be breached.\n\"If our learned Magistrates do not read the complaints and FIRs and go about passing orders mechanically, the first line of defense would naturally be breached,\" the order stated. \nThe Court made the observation while quashing an FIR which claimed that there was a conspiracy behind the registration sexual assault cases against Dr. Shivamurthy Muruga Sarana, the Pontiff of Sri Murugharajendra Bruhanmata, Chitradurga. \nThe Pontiff is facing two cases alleging sexual abuse of inmates of a hostel run by the Mutt. On Wednesday, he was granted bail by the High Court on the condition that he will not enter Chitradurga district till the conclusion of the trial.\nWhile quashing the another case alleging that there was a conspiracy against the Pontiff, Justice Devdas opined that if the magistrate had read the written complainant, it would have declined to take cognizance. \n“Our criminal justice system will not permit a parallel proceeding to test and verify the genuineness of the allegations made in a previous complaint [of sexual assault, in this case],” the Court added.\nThe Court further noted that if such parallel proceedings were permitted, the informant in the sexual assault case would be forced to stand trial or justify her allegations twice. \n“If permitted, such proceedings would amount to travesty of justice,” the judge said.\nHe went on to note that the information alleging conspiracy could be placed before the the court during the hearing of the sexual assault case. If the court concludes that false information was given to implicate the Pontiff, then the judge can take a call on whether to initiate perjury proceedings, he pointed out.\nMoreover, the High Court noted that when the application for remanding the Pontiff was filed by the police, the magistrate had been informed that the complaint alleging conspiracy was a counter blast to the case against the Pontiff.\nNevertheless, the Court found that the magistrate had proceeded to take cognizance “mechanically, unmindful of the grave consequences that befall the persons targeted in the complaint.”\nThe Court, therefore, quashed the conspiracy FIR and ordered that a copy of this order be circulated so that judicial officers are mindful about reading complaints before they proceed further with the case.\n“A copy of this order shall be forwarded to the Karnataka Judicial Academy, Bengaluru, to ensure that the learned Magistrates/Judges understand the efficacy of reading the criminal complaints/first information reports, before taking cognizance of a case,\" the order stated."}

It was also contended that the applicant was arrested from the spot.\nOne of the six witnesses, Pramod Kumar Dixit, in his statement said that he met a woman during a relative's treatment in the hospital who urged him to convert to Christianity to avail free lifetime medical assistance and jobs as well as financial assistance for his children.\nHe further stated that the woman introduced him to the some of the accused persons, including the applicant's wife, who took his Aadhar card and assured him that a new Aadhar card with his new name, after conversion, shall be issued to him.\nAccording to Dixit, 60-70 people of one community were present at the spot on the same day.\nThe State further argued that the applicant and his associates hatched a bigger conspiracy with wider ramifications because they were acting in an organized manner for mass conversion\nAs per the State, the individuals were not driven by their conscience but by systematic influence by coming in contact with the accused for medical treatment or otherwise, who offered them easy money, jobs and free healthcare.\nLastly, it was argued that the allegations of false implication and of the FIR being motivated were without substance and that bail at this stage would hinder the investigation. \nThe Court after taking into account the arguments, found no good ground to grant anticipatory bail and, therefore, rejected the plea."}

The veracity of the inputs and their sources must be demonstrated to be unimpeachable. The petitioners cannot assert that an unsubstantiated report in the newspapers should have credence over an investigation by a statutory regulator whose investigation has not been cast into doubt on the basis of cogent material or evidence,\" the Court made it clear. \nHence, it turned down plea for probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) or some other agency. \n\"This Court has the power under Articles 32 and 142 to transfer the probe to CBI etc but such powers can only be used sparingly and this court will not ordinarily supplant this role and the petitioners must put forth strong evidence to show that the investigative agency (SEBI) acted in a biased manner,\" the bench ruled.\nThere is no ground here to transfer the probe in this case and such a plea can only be raised if there was a wilful or deliberate violation of rules, the Court added. \nThe Hindenburg report alleged fraud on the part of the conglomerate by inflating share prices. The report had led to a fall in the share value of various Adani companies, reportedly to the tune of $100 billion.\nThe petitions before the apex court included one that alleged that changes to the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act (SEBI Act) had provided a 'shield and an excuse' for the Adani Group's regulatory contraventions and market manipulations to remain undetected.\nSubsequently, the Supreme Court had formed a committee headed by retired apex court judge, Justice AM Sapre to examine the controversy.\nThe Supreme Court had also asked SEBI to independently investigate the matter a submit a report.\nThe expert committee had in its report in May 2023 found no prima facie lapse on part of the markets regulator in the matter.\nThe petitioner had meanwhile also alleged conflict of interest on the part of SEBI on the ground that Cyril Shroff, the founder and managing partner of law firm Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas, was part of the SEBI's Committee on Corporate Governance while Shroff's daughter is married to Gautam Adani's son.\nThe petitioners had also objected to the inclusion of advocate Somasekhar Sundaresan (now a High Court judge) in the expert committee. They had contended that Sundaresan had appeared for the Adani Group as a lawyer in a matter before the SEBI.\nHowever, the Court in its judgment today rejected the contentions of conflict of interest and ruled that SEBI and Government of India are competent to probe the issue.\nThe Court also upheld SEBI's contention as regard the Foreign Portfolio Investor Regulations.\n\"SEBI says FPI regulations did not prohibit opaque structure and could in fact locate the beneficial owners. mandatory upfront disclosures meant that opaque structure was omitted in 2019. We find merit in SEBI's arguments and do not find reason to interfere in delegatory legislative powers. The current regulations are not tainted with illegality,\" the Court ruled.\nThe Court also noted that the petitioners had not challenged the vires of regulations but only contended that there was regulatory failure.\n\"Thus, it is a prayer which is unknown to this court and this is an after thought based on value judgment and is thus rejected,\" it said.\nIt, therefore, allowed SEBI to carry on with the probe and directed that the same be completed within three months."}

The guidelines do not deal with the most serious aspect of buildings and construction mushrooming around waterbodies ...

Additionally, it had imposed punitive damages of ₹10,000 on Amazon and the retailer, which was to be deposited with the District Consumer Legal Aid.\nIn its appeal before the State Commission, Amazon argued that it could not be held liable for the incorrect delivery as under Section 79 of the Information Technology Act, an intermediary cannot be held liable for third-party transactions. Therefore, it contended that only the retailer could be held liable.\nAmazon also claimed that the consumer had raised the grievance after the 'return window' was closed. Amazon added that nevertheless, it had offered a refund.\nOn the other hand, the consumer claimed that he had flagged the incorrect delivery on time and had refused to return the product for a refund as he wanted a replacement, which he had confirmed was available in Amazon's inventory, \nThe Commission noted that Amazon had only placed its terms of service on record, without placing an agreement between it and the retailer. \nThus, the Commission determined that Amazon could not benefit from safe harbor protection meant for intermediaries, which was subject to restrictions as provided under Sub-Sections (2) and (3) of Section 79 of IT Act.\nThe Commission further noted that the seller was registered with Amazon and had used the 'Fulfilled by Amazon' service, meaning that the seller first sends products to Amazon's fulfillment centers, from where they are delivered to the consumers. \n\"Therefore, in said terms Appellant/OP No.1 (Amazon) cannot escape from its responsibility under the garb of ‘intermediary’ and safe harbor protection under Section 79 of IT Act, 2000,\" the Commission held.\nAccordingly, it dismissed Amazon's appeal and upheld the order of the District Commission."}

It is certainly my hope that the endeavours of such industrious women ought to obtain unstinted support and encouragement, but the orders impugned in this writ petition can only serve to undermine the confidence and morale of persons like the petitioner, who bravely face the challenges of life every day, with the steely resolve to balance their personal and official life to the best of their capacity\"\nThe petition was filed through Advocate B Mohanlal by a woman who worked on contract basis as a counsellor in the Office of the District Child Protection Officer, Kollam. \nHer contract had been renewed for several years but after she gave birth to a child, she was constrained to avail maternity leave from November 2020.\nHer request for maternity leave was turned down by the Director, Women and Child Development Department and she was later terminated from service, accusing her of having been on unauthorised absence.\nThis prompted her to approach the Court.\nIt was submitted that she was initially selected for an one-year spell, after a process of selection, and appointed on contract from December 16, 2016 till August 21. 2017.\nIt was subsequently extended for one year at a time, till August 21, 2020. She contended that, thereafter, consequent to a fresh process of selection, she was further appointed with effect from August 23, 2020 till January 17, 2021, albeit, on daily wage basis.\nIt was during this period that she gave birth to a child forcing her to avail maternity leave. \nGovernment Pleader Sunil Kumar Kuriakose, appearing for the respondents, submitted that petitioner was not entitled to have sought maternity leave one day after she joined service on contract and he relied on Note 4 to Rule 100 of Part I of the Kerala Services Rules (KSR) in support.\nHe relied upon the judgement of a Division Bench of the Kerala High Court in Jisha P Jayan v. Sree Sankaracharya University of Sanskrit, Kalady in which it was held that only a contract employee who has been in service for at least one year or more is entitled to maternity leave and thus contended that the authorities were justified in having issued the order terminating her service.\nThe Court adverted to Note 4 to Rule 100 of Part I of the Kerala Services Rules, a woman employee, who is on provisional service, would be entitled to maternity leave, provided she was continuing beyond one year and would have continued in service, but for proceeding on such leave. \nThe Court observed that petitioner was serving as a counsellor on contract for several years, though with a break one or two days which happened whenever her contract was extended.\nEven if it is taken that she was not entitled to avail leave when engaged on daily wages, the Court stated that it failed to understand how the authorities, without any effective evaluation, concluded that she would not obtain the benefit of the relevant provisions of KSR, solely because she was working on a contract.\nThe Court also noted that the Director of the Women and Child Development Department seemed to have threatened action against the District Child Protection Officer for having selected and appointed the petitioner \"without proper care\", thus insinuating that he ought not to have offered employment to her solely because she had recently given birth to a child. \nThe Court, therefore, ordered that the petitioner be immediately reinstated to her position as a counsellor and that her application for leave be reconsidered as well.\nPertinently, Justice Ramachandran also observed that, \n\"Life as a new mother is like being on a roller-coaster and being a working mother is tougher. The minutiae of motherhood can never be properly contemplated and it involves navigation through myriad daily issues, which ultimately determine the health and future of the child.

{"ID": "id_911", "Summary": "The Calcutta High Court recently quashed a cheating and fraud case against a woman, whose husband accused her of taking away valuable ornaments and cell phone [Mithu Dash @ Bhuiya vs State of Maharashtra].\nSingle-judge Justice Shampa Dutt (Paul) noted that the petitioner-woman was married to the complainant-man since last 29 years and left her matrimonial house after she was tortured mentally and physically.\nThe bench noted from the material on record, that the woman had taken away - one piece gold Bala (bangle), one Loha covered with gold, two piece pola, covered with gold, one pair Sankhabadhano churi covered with gold. These ornaments, the bench noted were usually marriage ornaments and were worn by traditional Bengali married women.\nFurther, the petitioner was accused of taking away two mobile phones, one gold chain of her son and one gold necklace of her own.\n\"These ornaments/accessories as described, are worn on regular basis by a traditional Bengali married woman, who chooses to wear them.

{"ID": "id_912", "Summary": "A Special Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) Court in Delhi recently held that an accused cannot be compelled to provide the password of his electronic device to the investigating agency in view of the protection guaranteed by Article 20(3) of the Constitution [CBI v. Mahesh Kumar Sharma & Ors].\nSpecial Judge Naresh Kumar Laka, however, clarified that the investigating officer was within their right to access such data with the help of experts.\nDismissing the plea of the CBI seeking the relevant information, the order highlighted,\n“Accused cannot be compelled to give such information and in this regard he is protected by Article 20(3) of the Constitution of India as well as Section 161(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). However, the IO is within his right to access the data of the computer system and its soft-wares which were seized from the accused with the help of specialised agency or person at the risk of accused for loss of data, if any.”\nArticle 20(3) of the Constitution provides that no person accused of any offence shall be compelled to be a witness against himself, whereas Section 161 (2) of CrPC reads,\n“Such person (an accused or a witness) shall be bound to answer truly all questions, other than questions the answers to which would have a tendency to expose him to a criminal charge or to a penalty or forfeiture.”\nThe “interesting question” the Court was dealing with was on the power of the investigating agency to seek the password of the computer system seized from the accused along with password of the Tally software he had used on it.\nWhile the CBI did not mention any specific provision of the CrPC under which it was seeking the password from the accused, the Court said that the settled proposition of law was that in the absence of any specific provision of law or even when a wrong provision of law was cited, such plea ought not to be rejected straight away.\nIn its opinion, the CBI plea was to be treated under Sections 102 (power of police officer to seize certain property) and 161 (examination of witnesses by police) of CrPC read with Section 91 (summons to produce document or other thing) CrPC or such provisions that relate to “investigation” as given in criminal procedure code. \n“However, the said provisions like any other statutory legislation or delegated laws/rules are always subject to Constitutional law especially the Fundamental Rights as given, inter alia, in Article 20(3) of the Constitution of India which gives protection to the persons who are accused of committing criminal offences to maintain silence when they are compelled to give self-incriminating testimony,” the Court held.\nGiving password comes under \"testimonial fact\"\nThe Court relied upon several Supreme Court judgments before concluding that such information sought to be disclosed by the accused requires application of mental faculty or memory, which is purely based on personal mental effort or knowledge. Therefore, the required information was in the category of “testimonial fact” as explained in the Supreme Court decision in State of Bombay v. Kathi Kalu Oghad.\nIn that case, the Supreme Court laid down the test to identify whether information or evidence comes within the category of “testimonial fact”.\nEliciting the password of a computer system from an accused for accessing data was, in the Court's view, not akin to carrying out a comparison or identification. Thus,\n\"The fact of first category may be based on oral or written statement of an accused but they can still be compelled for the purpose of identification or comparison with facts and materials which are already in the possession of the investigating agency. The Article 20(3) can be invoked when the statements are likely to lead to incrimination by themselves or “furnish a link in the chain of evidence” needed to do so but not for comparision/identification with other evidence.\"\nIt added,\n\"In the case of Narco Analysis/Lie Detection Test, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India has held that such procedure involves personal knowledge of the accused, therefore, this cannot be done without his consent. Same logic applies to an password which is sought in this case as it also involves import of personal knowledge...\"\nThe same will also apply to drawing of a pattern as a security feature on a mobile phone or other electronic device, since the same requires application of mind and personal knowledge, the Court held.\nDistinction between password and biometrics\nThe Court said that though the Karnataka High Court in Virendra Khanna v. State of Karnataka held that password and biometrics are one and the same, the recent enactment of the Criminal Procedure (Identification) Act, 2022 called for a different approach to be adopted for password and biometrics of the accused.\nThough the legislature did not include the words \"password\" and/or user ID in the definition of “measurement” or anywhere else in the 2022 Act, powers have been given to the police and the Magistrate to direct an accused to provide his biometrics as mentioned in the definition of \"measurement\", the Court noted.\n\"In other words, said biometrics can be taken from an accused and used for opening of mobile phone/computer system/email/software applications, etc. by the police agency, wherever such need arises for a fair investigation...\"\n'Fruit of the poisoned tree' doctrine doesn't apply in India\nInterestingly, the Court referred to United States law, under which evidence obtained through illegal means cannot be relied in a court of law based on the doctrine of 'fruit of the poisoned tree'. However, in India, if evidence was obtained by resorting to illegal means or by not following the established procedure of law, the same could still be used in certain circumstances, it pointed out.\n“Therefore, there is a risk of the Constitutional Right under Article 20(3) of the Constitution of India being jeopardised if such request of the IO to compel an accused to provide his password is allowed because once his data is accessed/opened by IO and if it reveals something incriminating, it may be read against the accused,” it added."}

The Court said that ₹5,000 would have to be paid for every day that the payment is delayed.\nThe Court had reserved its verdict in the matter on April 21 after hearing extensive arguments by both parties.\nTwitter contended that the Central government was not empowered to issue general orders calling for the blocking of social media accounts and that the orders must contain reasons which should be communicated to users.\nIt also stated that a blocking order could only be issued in a situation where the nature of the content was in line with the grounds laid down under Section 69A of the Information Technology Act.\nAdditionally, if reasons were not recorded in such blocking orders, there would be a possibility of reasons being manufactured at a later stage, Twitter said. \nInvocation of Article 226 of the Constitution (writ jurisdiction of High Courts) was also argued to be not limited to the violation of Constitutional rights and there was no bar on Twitter approaching the Court, the social media giant argued.\nOn the other hand, the Central government contended that Twitter cannot speak on behalf of its account holders and, therefore, it had no locus standi to file the petition.\nFurther, since Twitter is a foreign entity and the government's ten blocking orders were not arbitrary, the company could not fall back on fundamental rights under Articles 14 (right to equality) and 19 (right to freedom of speech and expression) of the Indian Constitution to argue the matter.\nIn its petition filed before the High Court, Twitter contended that account-level blocking is a disproportionate measure and violates the rights of users under the Constitution.\nOut of a total of 1,474 accounts and 175 tweets, Twitter challenged the blocking of only 39 URLs.\nThe petition stated that the orders in question are manifestly arbitrary, and procedurally and substantively not in consonance with Section 69A of the IT Act.\nFurther, they fail to comply with the procedures and safeguards prescribed by the Information Technology (Procedure and Safeguards for Blocking for Access of Information by Public) Rules, 2009 (Blocking Rules), it was submitted.\nTwitter also argued that the direction to block entire accounts falls afoul of Section 69A of the IT Act.\nThe Central government submitted in its reply that the directions to block certain Twitter accounts were issued in national and public interest and to prevent incidents of lynching and mob violence.\nThe government emphasised that it is committed to providing an open, safe, trusted and accountable internet to its citizens, and that its powers to block information has a limited scope.\nSenior Advocates Ashok Haranahalli, Arvind Datar and Advocate Manu Kulkarni represented Twitter while Additional Solicitor General of India R Sankaranarayanan appeared for the Central government."}

The High Court relied on this ruling as well to grant default bail in the present case. \n\"In view of all that has been observed above and in the light of the fact that the petitioners are behind bars since last more than nine months, this Court deems it appropriate to extend them the concession of bail in terms of Section 167(2) Cr.P.C,\" the High Court said.\nThe judge, however, clarified that the prosecution can seek a recall of the bail order if either the Full Bench of the High Court or the Supreme Court decides in favour of the prosecution on the larger question of whether a chargesheet is incomplete without the FSL report.\nThe case before the High Court concerned an NDPS case lodged in Faridabad. The police filed the final report before the trial court on April 28. The trial court declined to grant the accused statutory default bail to the accused, leading to a challenge before the High Court\nThe High Court was called to consider whether the accused would have the right to seek statutory bail when the challan was not accompanied by the FSL report. \nThe prosecution argued that the chargesheet cannot be termed incomplete just because it was filed without an FSL report.\nJustice Suri noted that the High Court, in an earlier ruling, had held that an accused would be entitled to default bail if the chargesheet is not accompanied by an FSL report. This was followed in a 2021 High Court ruling as well.\nHowever, a reference made in September 2020 on whether such a chargesheet was complete was also pending before a larger bench of the High Court.

Why do we repeatedly cause embarrassment to ourselves?,\" the Chief Justice asked. \nThe remarks came after the Court came across videos on social media showing a large number of priests moving around in pilgrimage centres, Badrinath and Kedarnath in violation of social distancing norms. \n\"Who is supervising, or is it left to the priests? What happens if Corona virus spreads among the priests?

{"ID": "id_921", "Summary": "The Karnataka High Court last week dismissed pleas challenging the acquisition of land for the implementation of the Upper Krishna Project (UKP) which was for the avowed public purpose of irrigating large tracts of land in various districts of North Karnataka [Gopal v. State of Karnataka].\nA Division Bench of Justices Krishna S Dixit and P Krishna Bhat opined that when a measure was taken by the government pursuant to a policy framed with the opinion of experts, the Court should refrain from acting like a super-accountant, and interference should be extremely rare.\n“It is primarily the task of the Government to govern and in the guise of judicial review, Courts should not seek to run the governments. Smelling foul-play in the action of the government at a mere whiff of suggestion would make running the administration an impossibility and elected governments which are accountable to the people will be hamstrung in implementing projects for promoting public weal,” the court said.\nIn its judgment, the Court took note that the UKP was conceived on account of severe droughts affecting large parts of North Karnataka. In 2010, the Krishna Water Dispute Tribunal had called for an increase in the height of the River's dam. This, it was noted, would submerge large parts of land in the Northern part of the State.\nThe notifications under challenge were issued to establish townships in order to rehabilitate and resettle people who were going to be displaced on account of such flooding.\nThey were first challenged before a single-judge, who dismissed the petitions. Aggrieved by the dismissal, this appeal was filed.\nThe appellants had challenged the acquisition of their land on the ground that it was not supported by “public purpose” and was, in fact, colourable exercise of power.\nIn this regard, the Court said that the declaration of “public purpose” in the acquisition notification was final, except in the rare case where colourable exercise of such power or fraud on power is demonstrated before a Constitutional Court.\n“There is absolutely no material to support the contention that the acquisition is colourable exercise of power and therefore, illegal,” it recorded.\nIt was also argued that the statement of objections filed by the appellants was not considered.\nHowever, the Court found that the objections were extremely bald and general in nature, lacking specificity, and incapable of being dealt with by the competent authority.\nThe Bench emphasised that its intervention was called for only when violation of the constitutional right of a citizen was demonstrated.\nThe Court went on to say that it could not don the hat of a town planner or that of an accountant to minutely examine whether a slightly lesser extent of land would have fulfilled the objective or whether the project could have been implemented satisfactorily at another location.\n“Such an exercise by us would tantamount to substituting our views to that of the State which has the advantage of expert advice.”\nIt was acknowledged that there may be some errors or some minor infractions, but these would exist in any human endeavour, and were inevitable.\n“But, we are conscious that it is not for us to do nit picking and smell foul-play at mere whiff of a suggestion,” the judgment stated.\nWith this, the appeals were dismissed.\nSenior Advocate Ashok Haranahalli and Advocates Basavaraj Godachi and CV Angadi appeared for the appellants while the respondents were represented by Additional Advocate General TK Vidyavathi and Senior Advocate GK Hiregoudar."}

The rights of the daughters could not have been extinguished in the manner in which they have been attempted to be extinguished by the brothers, post the father's demise,\" the bench held. \nIt further found lack of material to prove that the four daughters were given sufficient dowry.  \n\"The evidence on record shows that the joint family property was purported to be exclusively usurped by the brothers to exclude the sisters. Merely because one of the sisters deposed in favour of the brothers does not mean that the issue of family arrangement or oral partition was duly proved,\" the bench said.\nThe bench was hearing a plea filed by a woman seeking an injunction against her mother and four brothers, from creating any third party rights in her family's properties. \nThe appellant, was the eldest married daughter of the house. However, she was not given share in any of the properties by her four brothers and mother. \nShe pointed out that the mother and the other sisters had given consent to a transfer deed executed in 1990 in favor of two of her brothers. By virtue of this transfer deed, the family's shop and house were transferred in the favor of the two brothers. \nShe contended that she learnt of the same only in 1994 and subsequently she instituted proceedings before the civil court. Her suit was decreed by the civil court; however, an appeal against it was allowed by the appellate court due to which she petitioned the High Court. \nThe brothers contended that she had no right in the properties. They relied on the \"oral partition\" of the said properties, wherein their other three sisters had given up their rights as they too were given dowry at the time of their wedding, like the appellant. \nTo this, the judge said, \n\"There is no evidence whatsoever to sustain such a plea. Merely stating that there was some family arrangement by which four daughters of Antonio (father) and Matilda (mother) were given dowry at the time of their marriages is insufficient to spell out the ingredients of the family arrangement or an oral partition. Secondly, in terms of Article 2184 of the Portuguese Civil Code, a partition which is merely severance of a joint status cannot be effected orally and has necessarily to be by a written document.\"\nThe brothers also contented that the present proceedings were barred by the Limitation Act as the same allows filing of a suit only within three years of knowing about the decree or execution of the deed. \nIn the instant case, the brothers argued that the transfer deed was executed in 1990 and the suit was filed by the appellant in 1994. \nHowever, Justice Sonak noted that the appellant had clearly testified that she filed the suit within six weeks of learning about the said deed. He pointed out that the brothers failed to prove that the appellant learnt about the said deed in 1990 itself.\n\"To my mind, this was a slender base to non-suit the Appellant on the limitation issue. The Trial Court failed to account for the evidence where the Appellant disclaimed knowledge about the Court proceedings to which she was not a party and, of course, the transfer deed,\" the judge said. \nWith these observations, the bench quashed the said transfer deed and granted an injunction in favor of the appellant. \nAdvocates CA Coutinho and Ivan Santimano appeared for the appellant. \nSenior Advocate AF Diniz along with advocates Ryan Menezes and S Alvares represented the defendants."}

{"ID": "id_925", "Summary": "The Jharkhand High Court recently said that disgruntled wives are using Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), which criminalises cruelty to women by her in-laws, as a weapon rather than a shield.\nJustice Sanjay Kumar Dwivedi observed that such cases are often filed by wives in the heat of the moment over trivial issues, without proper deliberation.\n\"With the laudable object of punishing cruelty at the hands of husband or his relatives, Section 498-A of the Indian Penal Code was inserted in the statute. There is a phenomenal increase in matrimonial disputes in recent years and it appears that in many cases, the object of Section 498-A of the Indian Penal Code is being misused and the said Section is used as weapon rather than shield by disgruntled wives.\"\nMinor matrimonial skirmishes often assume serious proportions, resulting in commission of heinous crimes in which elders of the family are falsely implicated by the wives, the Court added.\nIt was the case of the petitioners (in-laws of the complainant) before the Court that the complaint filed against them alleging torture was false, because they were traveling at the time.\nThe Court observed that the petitioners reside in Hyderabad, while the alleged incident occurred in Dhanbad. \nFurther, on the date of the alleged incident, the petitioners were traveling on a train, implying the possibility of false statements in the complaint, the Court added.\nThe Court also observed that the petitioners' roles were not disclosed in the case, and the allegations against them were only general and vague.\nExpressing its disappointment with the filing of baseless cases under Section 498A of the IPC, the Court dismissed the entire criminal proceedings, including the order taking cognisance against the petitioners.\nAdvocate Ashma Khanam appeared for petitioners.\nAdvocate Sanjay Kumar Srivastava appeared for the State.\nAdvocate Soumitra Baroi appeared for the complainant."}

{"ID": "id_927", "Summary": "What is in the best interest of a young child cannot be solely based on the love and care of the child's mother, the Bombay High Court recently held in a custody case.\nA Bench of Justices Revati Mohite Dere and Gauri Godse made the observation while deciding a habeas corpus petition filed by a father in 2020 for the custody of his 3-year-old US-born child. The petitioner father sought physical custody of his child to take him to the USA.\nThe Court directed the mother to return the custody of the minor child to the father within a period of 15 days. \nIt emphasized that the issue of custody ought to be decided only on the basis of what is in the best interest of the child.\n\"The expression “best interest of the child”, which is always kept to be of paramount consideration cannot remain only the love and care of the primary caregiver i.e. the mother in the case of the child who is only a few years old and the basis for any decision taken regarding the child, is to ensure fulfilment of his basic rights and needs, identity, social well-being and physical, emotional and intellectual development. However, while deciding the welfare of the child, it is not the view of one spouse alone which has to be taken into consideration,\" the judgment stated.\nThe couple got married in March 2010 and moved to the USA in June the same year to settle down permanently. They obtained a green card in October. The child was born in December 2019. \nThe respondent mother travelled with the son to India in December 2020 and informed the petitioner that he should not contact her. \nThe father then informed the US Embassy in India that his son had been abducted and also approached the police in India. He filed the present petition the same month. \nOn the other hand, the mother lodged a domestic violence complaint against the father in India and also filed for divorce. Meanwhile, a US court allowed the father's divorce plea in April 2021 and granted him irrevocable custody of the son.\nThe High Court observed that the proceedings initiated by the mother in India seemed to be an afterthought, only with an intention of not allowing the father to take the child back to the US. It also remarked that since matrimonial disputes involving custody of children are bitterly fought in courts, children suffer the most. \nIn this light, it said,\n\"The Court is required to exercise parent patriae jurisdiction and compel the parties to do something that is in the best interest of the child. Hence, in such a peculiar situation, it is the responsibility of the Court to enter into the role of a guardian for the child.\"\nThe Court also observed that the father could provide the best of both countries to his son, who was also entitled to health benefits being a US citizen.\n\"Considering the petitioner’s work profile, he is allowed to work from home most of the time. It is not disputed that the petitioner is also a certified cricket coach; he is an excellent cook and can cook any cuisine. The child, being a US National, is also entitled to all the health care facilities in the US. The wife is also a green card holder and permanent resident of the US. Thus, all these factors support the petitioner's case that it will be in the interest of the child to return to the US,\" the judgment recorded.\nThe Court further noted that after the parties had consciously decided to make the child a US citizen, the mother was not justified in taking a unilateral decision to prevent the child from returning to the USA.\nThe Court also said that other than the child being of a tender age, there was no other factor in the mother's favour. It thus allowed the father's petition subject to certain conditions.\nAdvocates Prabhjit Jauhar, Niranjan Mundargi, Keral Mehta, Vikrant Shinde and Jai Abhyudaya Vaidya appeared for the father.\nSenior Advocate Lata Desai with Advocates Dr Palavi Divekar, Manasi Hirve and Darshana Pawar appeared for the mother."}
{"ID": "id_928", "Summary": "The Kerala High Court recently held that a muslim woman who obtained divore through khula cannot claim maintenance from her husband after the date of effecting khula. \nAccording to Mulla’s Principles of Mahomedan Law, khula is a divorce with the consent and at the instance of the wife in which she gives or agrees to give a consideration to the husband for her release from the marriage tie.\nJustice A Badharudeen observed that a Muslim woman can claim maintenance under Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) till she remarries, but clause 4 of this provision says that she will not be entitled to maintenance or interim maintenance if she refuses to live with her husband or if they are living separately by mutual consent.\nNoting that khula is akin to a refusal to live with the husband, the Court reasoned that the wife would not be entitled to claim maintenance after she pronounces khula.\n\"When the wife effects divorce by Khula for getting her released from the husband, the same, in fact, is akin to refusal of the wife to live with her husband, as provided under Section 125(4) of Cr.P.C. If so, the wife, who effected divorce by Khula at her volition and thereby refuses to live with her husband voluntarily, is not entitled to get maintenance from the date of Khula in view of the restriction provided under Section 125(4) of CrPC,\" the Court held in its judgment.\nThe judgment was passed on a revision petition moved by a man challenging an order of the family court that directed him to pay allowance of ₹10,000 each to his ex-wife and son.\nThe husband contended that the marriage failed due to adultery on the part of the wife. Moreover, it was argued that he should not have to pay maintenance from May 27, 2021 at least since the marriage was dissolved by pronouncement of khula on that date.\nThe High Court went through the material placed on record by the petitioner-husband but found that the claim of adultery cannot be proved. However, it noted that the parties had lived separately from December 31, 2018 and the litigation between them commenced in 2019.\nThe Court also took into account the fact that the wife had no permanent income or employment to maintain herself and their child.\nTherefore, it affirmed the payment of maintenance but altered the quantum and period for which the maintenance must be paid to ₹7,000 for the wife and ₹10,000 for the son for the period till May 27, 2021. \nThe husband was represented by advocates Shaijan Joseph Joseph, Varghese Mundakkal and Surmi Shakeel. \nThe wife and son were represented by advocates T Asafali and Laliza TY."}

The deceased MLA had acquired several assets in the names of his wife and his minor children and Nallammal aided in the crime by lending her name to such illegal acquisition of assets, the Court said.\nThe Court also refused to show any leniency on ground of Nallammal’s advanced age into account and said that she had been sentenced to one year prison term by the sessions court, which was the minimum sentence for the offences she had been charged for.\n“As far as the sentence imposed on A-2 for aiding, the Learned Counsel for the appellant submitted that, A-2 been facing the ordeal of criminal prosecution for more than 25 years.

The offence being acquiring wealth by a public servant beyond his known source of income and A-2 for aiding the public servant, had been sentenced for one year R.I being the minimum sentence prescribed under the law.

{"ID": "id_931", "Summary": "The right of a human being to choose his/her sex or gender identity is integral to his or her personality and is one of the most basic aspects of self-determination, dignity and freedom, the Rajasthan High Court recently observed. \nSingle-judge Justice Anoop Kumar Dhand, therefore, ordered authorities to consider changing the details in the service record of a man who was assigned female gender at birth. \n\"The right of a human being to choose his/her sex or gender identity is integral to his or her personality and is one of the most basic aspects of self determination, dignity and freedom,\" the judge observed in the order passed on May 25. \nThe petitioner was assigned female gender at birth. \nThe petitioner secured a job in 2013 under the General Female Category but was diagnosed with Gender Identity Disorder (GID) and subsequently underwent a gender reassignment surgery (GRS) and became a male. He then married a woman and became a father of two children. \nThe petitioner submitted that unless his name and gender is changed in his service records, it would be difficult for him and his family to get the benefits of his service and therefore, the authorities should make the requisite changes.\nOpposing the submissions, the State argued that the petitioner got appointment as a female candidate and the name and gender was recorded on the basis of the identity furnished the. For change in sex based on gender identity, a declaration to that effect should be obtained from the Civil Court, it was submitted.\nAfter considering the contentions, the Court underscored that gender identity is one of the most basic and fundamental aspects of one's life.\n\"Gender identity is the most fundamental aspect of life which refers to a person’s intrinsic value of being a male or female. There are times when human body is not formed with all of its proper attributes, therefore genital anatomy problems may arise and many of them do not choose to undergo GRS to change their gender. Everyone is entitled to enjoy all human rights which are a basic necessity to survive, without discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity,\" the single-judge underlined. \nHe also referred to Rigveda, which defines men as \"Purush\" and women as \"Prakriti.\"\n\"And the third gender that is the ‘Tritiya Prakriti’. In the recent times, the modern Indian society have considered them as the third gender otherwise there was no such identity given to them legally. Still, all is not well, and the third gender people are struggling to constitute a part of the civil society,\" the bench emphasised. \nRight to equality is guaranteed by the Constitution of India which is the basic Fundamental Right which all Indians inherit since they become a part of our mother’s (India's) womb, the Court said.\n\"Everybody on this planet has a right to be treated with respect and dignity, be it a Male or a Female or any other gender. Till the past, we used to consider Male and Female as two biological sex but the developed science has proved that there are more genders than just cisgender,\" the bench underlined. \nThe Court referred to the provisions of the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act of 2019, enacted to provide equality and respect to the transgender persons. \n\"This Act is a social beneficial legislation and therefore, it cannot be given an interpretation which would defeat the very purpose for which the same is brought in force. One of the provisions is to provide them appropriate changed certificates and identity documents, if they undergo a GRS,\" the judgment said. \nIt further noted that the Act allows persons like the petitioner, who had undergone the GRS prior to the Act of 2019, to apply before the District Magistrate for issuance of a certificate indicating change in gender. \n\"Only on the basis of such a certificate issued by the District Magistrate under Section 7 of the Act, the transgender person can apply for change in their birth certificate and other official documents relating to their identity. Denying such a right to person who had already undergone the GRS, would frustrate the very purpose of the Act, as large number of persons would be left out discriminated in the society,\" the Court held. \nThe object of this enactment is to give effect to the rights guaranteed to such persons under Articles 14, 15, 19 and 21 of the Constitution of India, the Court said. \nIt, therefore, ordered the petitioner to file an application before the District Magistrate seeking change in his gender details and then make a fresh application before the authorities to change his service records.\nThe matter was adjourned till September 4 with a directive to the authorities to file a compliance report. \nAdvocates Arvind Sharma and Mamta Agarwal appeared for the Petitioners. \nAdditional Government Counsel S Zakawat Ali represented the State."}
{"ID": "id_932", "Summary": "The Madras High Court recently held that a sub-registrar or any other concerned State government authority cannot refuse to register the sale certificate of a property merely on the ground that such property had previously been mortgaged or attached. \nJustice N Sathish Kumar struck down the first proviso to Rule 55A(i) of the Tamil Nadu Registration Rules, which had empowered sub-registrars to refuse the registration of any document related to immovable properties if the latter had been mortgaged or attached or a sale or lease agreement existed over them. \nThe proviso provided that such a bar on registration would continue until the time limit for filing a suit against such mortgage, attachment etc. was over. \nThe High Court said that Rule 55A(i), a subordinate legislation that came into effect on September 5, 2022, was \"ex facie in conflict\" with the provisions of the Parent Act and Transfer of Property Act, 1982 as well as Constitutional rights extended to property owners. \nRule 55A (i) mandated that sale deeds or any other document pertaining to properties that have been mortgaged or attached, or, were the subject of sale or lease agreements, could only be registered after the lapse of the time limit for filing a civil suit, or, after the attachment was raised. This was despite the fact that Sections 48 and 56 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1982, permitted owners to deal with mortgaged or leased properties. \nJustice Kumar therefore, said that the Tamil Nadu Rules were, in effect, nullifying the above provisions of the 1982 Act. \n\"The first proviso to Rule 55-A is clearly illegal and vitiated by a clear abuse of power,\" the High Court said, adding that such proviso had been introduced without any application of mind.\"Normally, a subordinate legislation like a rule is authorized by a substantive provision of law. However, this is a unique case where a rule is authorized by another rule,\" the High Court said. \nThe Court added that the said proviso also went against the legal position settled in the division bench decision in Ramayee v Sub-Registrar, which was subsequently affirmed by the Supreme Court. \n\"Thus, when the legal position has already been declared by the Division Bench of this Court and has been affirmed by the Supreme Court it is not open to the Inspector General of Registration to take a contra view and notify a subordinate legislation the effect of which is to completely render nugatory to the interpretation made by this Court. Ex-facie, the first proviso to Rule 55-A (i) is clearly illegal and is vitiated by a clear abuse of power,\" the Court observed.\nThe Court was hearing a plea filed by Federal Bank challenging the decision of the sub-registrar in Pollachi district, to register the sale certificate of a property. \nAdvocate AV Radhakrishnan, who appeared for the petitioner-bank, told the Court that the bank had extended a loan to a private party and the borrower had executed a mortgage in favour of the bank by depositing the title deeds of the property in question. \nWhen the borrower failed to repay the loan, the bank declared it as a non-performing asset, and as per procedure, auctioned the property and sold it to the highest bidder. \nHowever, when the bank approached the sub-registrar for the registration of the sale certificate of the auctioned property, the latter refused to do so on the ground that the said property had previously been attached under the GST Act. \nThe petitioner argued that the attachment under the Goods and Services Tax Act (GST Act) was a provisional one, and had already lapsed. \nSpecial Government Pleader Yogesh Kannadasan, who appeared for the TN government authorities, told the Court that as per Rule 55A, if any property is attached or mortgaged or lease agreement is entered into, the sale deed cannot be registered. \nThe High Court, however, refused to accept such submission and said that since it held that the first proviso to Rule 55-A had been found to \"be invalid and ultra vires, the respondent cannot refuse to register the document placing reliance on the aforesaid proviso.\"\nIt directed the concerned authorities to register the sale certificate of such property within 15 days from the date of the order."}

Directions were also sought to Twitter and Google to take down the posts or links or references to the story. \nThe Wire had published a report on November 9, 2023 titled 'Links of son of Delhi Chief Secretary to Beneficiary's Family in Land Over-Valuation Case Raise Questions.' \nThe report said that Naresh Kumar's son Karan Chauhan had links with a family which benefitted from the hiked compensation when a plot of land measuring 19 acre in Delhi's Bamnoli village was acquired by the NHAI for the Dwarka Expressway. \nKumar then filed the present defamation suit before the High Court through advocates through Advocates Bani Dikshit, Uddhav Khanna and Krishan Kumar against The Wire and reporter Meetu Jain for defamation.\nHe sought the takedown of the story and tweets related to the story and also prayed for directions to restrain The Wire from publishing any further defamatory allegations and to take down of tweets related to the story.\nIn a detailed order, the Justice Datta observed that the nexus sought to be drawn between the beneficiaries of the arbitral award [enhanced compensation] and Kumar’s son was quite far-fetched.\nThe Court came to a prima facie conclusion that the article was a “litany of misrepresentations and convoluted insinuations made in a reckless manner, without any regard for the truth, and with a view to inflict damage” Kumar’s reputation.\n “While freedom of speech and expression is sacrosanct, the reputation of a person earned over several decades, cannot be sacrificed at the altar of such freedom, when the impugned publication, ex-facie, contains unsubstantiated allegations and defamatory imputations, regardless of the truth,” the Court observed.\nIt added,\n“In the present case, the Court has also taken note of the crescendo of politically motivated tweets/posts/comments, virtually in sync with the publication of the aforesaid article/publication dated 09.11.2023, which further validate the necessity of urgent injunctive order/s.

{"ID": "id_937", "Summary": "A Mumbai sessions court recently denied pre-arrest bail to five persons accused of duping several people by promising them Maharashtra Housing and Development Authority (MHADA) flats at cheaper rates. [Sujata Sunil Ghatvisave vs State of Maharashtra]\nAdditional sessions judge MG Deshpande passed the order after observing that often the hard earned money of innocent people in Mumbai go waste as such 'cheaters' dupe them.\n\"In Mumbai, everyone is in ardent need of permanent ownership residence and people like present accused gain confidence and cheat the needy. The hard earned life earnings of people like the informant, go waste and such people never get any house or even refund of their money. On the contrary, cheaters like the accused get easy money by such offences,\" the court observed in its order passed on July 13.\nThe court noted that the all the five accused had a dishonest intention to cheat innocent persons right from the beginning.\nTherefore, the accused gained the homebuyer's confidence by impersonating officials of the MHADA, the Court observed. It further noted that the accused managed to procure huge sums of money from various persons with false identity cards.\n\"In Mumbai, such incidents are frequently happening. Granting Anticipatory Bail to the people like applicant who have been involved in such scams will ultimately amount putting premium on their criminal activities,\" the court added.\nThe main accused in the case, Sunil Ghatvisave, had allegedly offered the complainant, a resident of Dadar, a flat in suburban Parel area under the MHADA scheme, for ₹30 lakh in 2017. The complainant, paid the initial ₹19 lakh through cheques and the remaining ₹12 lakhs were paid after taking loans from various relatives. \nDuring the probe, it transpired that around ₹14 lakh was transferred to the account of the the wife of the prime accused, Sunil. The wife was one of the applicants before the court seeking pre-arrest bail.\nThe bench observed that taking money to cheat the informant, prima facie, indicated the dishonest intention of the accused right from the beginning.\n\"All this clearly indicates that the applicant had syphoned of money which he has collected from the informant and his friends who were in ardent need of ownership house at reasonable price in Prabhadevi area. The investigation is at a very preliminary stage and the material on record, indicates a well calculated and well planned syndicate for cheating people like informant and his friends by taking disadvantage of their ardent need (sic),\" the court underscored in its order.\nThe court refused to accept the contention of the five accused (applicants) that they had no knowledge of the cheating offence being committed by Sunil and that they had merely received money from his accounts.\nReceiving amounts in bank accounts, prima-facie, reflected that all the applicant-accused had concrete knowledge of the purpose for which money was transferred in their accounts, the court opined. \nTherefore, it is a clear case of cheating where the hard earned life earnings of people like informant and his friends were taken, the Court noted.\nIt, therefore, proceeded to dismiss the anticipatory bail application in respect of all five applicants. \nAdvocate Rahul S Arote appeared for the applicants.\nAdditional Public Prosecutor Rashmi Tendulkar represented the State."}

{"ID": "id_94", "Summary": "The Delhi High Court recently held that not fasting on Karwa Chauth is an individual’s choice and it would neither amount to cruelty nor be sufficient to sever marital ties.\nA Division Bench of Justices Suresh Kumar Kait and Neena Bansal Krishna observed that having different religious beliefs and not performing certain religious duties also do not by itself amount to cruelty.\n\"Fasting or not fasting on Karwa Chauth may be an individual choice and if dispassionately considered, may not be termed as an act of cruelty. Having different religious beliefs and not performing certain religious duties, perse would not amount to cruelty or would not be sufficient to sever a marital tie,” the Court held.\nHowever, the Court upheld a family court's decision to allow a divorce plea by the husband in this case since on an overall consideration of the facts, it was apparent that the wife \"had no respect for the husband and their marital bond.\"\nThe High Court made the observations while rejecting an appeal by a woman who challenged the family court order granting her estranged husband divorce on the grounds of cruelty.\nThe parties got married in the year 2009 and a daughter was born from the wedlock in 2011. However, the husband stated that since the beginning of the marriage, the conduct of the wife was indifferent and that she had no interest in discharging her matrimonial obligations.\nAmong several other grounds taken, the husband also said that on the day of Karwachauth of 2009, the wife got annoyed with him and decided not to fast because he did not recharge her phone.\nIt was also alleged that in April, when the husband developed a slip disc, the wife, rather than taking care of him, removed vermillion from her forehead, broke bangles and wore a white suit, declaring that she had became a widow.\nThe Court considered all the facts and held that the conduct of the wife, coupled with her decision not to follow prevalent rituals in Hindu culture which symbolised love and respect for the husband, supported the conclusion that she had no respect for her husband.\n\"When coupled with the conduct of the appellant/wife and in the circumstances as proved by the respondent/husband in the present case, it is established that non-conforming with the prevalent rituals in Hindu culture, which symbolizes love and respect for the husband as well as the matrimonial relationship, fortifies the irresistible conclusion that appellant/wife had no respect for the respondent/husband and their marital bond. It also reflects that the appellant/wife had no intention to continue her marriage with the respondent/husband,\" the Court said. \nThe Court further said that nothing can be a more harrowing experience for a husband than to see his wife act like a widow during his lifetime, that too when he was seriously injured and expected nothing more than care and compassion from his significant half.\n“Undeniably, such conduct of the appellant/wife can only be termed as an act of extreme cruelty towards the respondent/husband,\" the High Court said. \nThe Court further noted that the wife filed criminal complaints against her husband and his aged parents but was not able to justify the grounds on which these complaints were made.\nIt also observed that the wife left her matrimonial home barely within one year and three months of marriage and had not made any reconciliatory efforts or attempted to return to the matrimonial home.\n“We thus, conclude that the evidence on record proved that there is no chance of reconciliation between the parties and such long separation peppered which false allegations, Police reports and criminal trial can only be termed as mental cruelty. The marital discord between the parties has pinnacled to complete loss of faith, trust, understanding, love and affection between the parties. This dead relationship has become infested with acrimony, irreconcilable differences and protracted litigations; any insistence to continue this relationship would only be perpetuating further cruelty upon both the parties,\" the Court said. \nThe Court, therefore, held that the appellant/wife has acted with cruelty towards the respondent/husband and that the divorce under Section 13(1)(ia) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 was rightly granted by the family court. \nAdvocate Meenakshi Kalra appeared for the wife.\nThe husband was represented through advocates AP Mohanty, CM Thapliyal, SP Paul, Kiran Lata Pal and Kanchan Thapliyal."}

Bashir Ahmed Chopan & Ors., in which the High Court itself had held that a driver holding a driving license entitling him to drive a heavy goods vehicle is not competent to drive a passenger- carrying vehicle unless there is a PSV (public service vehicle) endorsement.\nThe High Court said that the question that it needs to answer in this case was \"whether a a driver holding a license to drive a heavy goods vehicle is eligible to drive a passenger-carrying vehicle.\" \nAfter referring to the provisions of the Motor Vehicle Act of 1988, the Court observed that a passenger-carrying vehicle falls within the definition of 'transport vehicle' as contained in Section 2(47) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988.\nThe Court said that the amended clause (e) of Section 10(2) of the Motor Vehicle Act has replaced all types of commercial vehicles in 'transport vehicles', which includes goods vehicles as well as passenger-carrying vehicles.\nTherefore, any person holding a driving license which authorizes him to drive a particular type of commercial vehicle would automatically be eligible to drive any other type of commercial vehicle including passenger carrying vehicle, the Court concluded.\nHence, it can be safely stated that the driving license held by driver was valid and effective license authorising him to drive the offending vehicle, the Court said.\nFurther, the Court opined that the ratio laid down in the judgment referred by appellant, that is the one in National Insurance Company Lts v. Bashir Ahmed Chopan & Ors., is per incuriam (in ignorance of law). The Court said that it is not a binding precedent because it seems that the amended provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act were not brought to the notice of the Court at the time of passing of that judgment.\nEven otherwise, the referred judgment had been passed without taking note of the binding precedent delivered by a division bench of the Court in 'National Insurance Co. Ltd v. Mohd Sadiq Kuchay & Ors. in which it was held that a PSV endorsement in accordance with the Jammu and Kashmir Motor Vehicle Rules is not necessary and that if a driver is competent to drive a particular class of transport vehicle, he is competent to drive any other class of transport vehicle, the Court said.\nAccordingly, the appeal filed by Insurance company against the award granted by the MACT was dismissed by the High Court\nThe appellant was represented by Advocate Udhay Bhaskar.

{"ID": "id_941", "Summary": "The Delhi High Court recently made it clear that the permission of the Tree Officer in line with the Delhi Preservation of Trees Act, 1994 (DPT Act) is mandatory before pruning trees in Delhi regardless of the tree's girth size [Prof Dr Sanjeev Bagai & Ors v Department of Environment Govt of NCT of Delhi & Ors].\nTo this end, the Court set aside guidelines that had allowed the pruning of branches of trees having a girth size of up to 15.7 cm without prior permission from the Tree Officer. \nIn an order passed on May 29, Justice Najmi Waziri noted that the DPT Act does not allow the cutting of tree branches without such permission. The figure of \"15.7 cm\" referred to in the guidelines was incongruous with the statutory requirements mandated under the DPT Act, the Court said.\n“The so-called permission granted under the Guidelines seek to over-reach the statute. The Guidelines are in conflict with the DPT Act, they are arbitrary and illegal. Consequently, the permission for pruning, presumed to be or granted under the Guidelines would be of no consequence and shall always be non est. Therefore, the Guidelines permitting regular pruning of branches of trees with girth upto 15.7 cm without specific prior permission of the Tree Officer are hereby set aside. The only permission that can be granted for pruning, etc. is under section 9 of the Act,” the Court ordered.\nThe Court added that the government authorities can frame guidelines and/or rules as may be required in this regard.\nThe Court was dealing with a petition filed by Professor Dr. Sanjeev Bagai and others challenging an order passed by the National Green Tribunal (NGT). The petition had sought directions regarding the procedure adopted for the pruning of trees. The petitioners also contended that the guidelines issued in this respect were erroneous.\nThe counsel appearing for the petitioners highlighted that these guidelines permitted pruning of trees without prior approval and without even a site inspection or assessment by the Tree Officer/Deputy Conservator of Forests.\nThe guidelines permitted private parties/entities to prune trees even on land owned by government authorities like the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD), Delhi Development Authority (DDA), and the Public Works Department (PWD), the Court was told.\nJustice Waziri observed that a tree is a living being which must, at least, be given a ‘last look’ and accorded a final inspection before a decision is taken to permit its felling or amputating its live branches.\nThe Court also examined some pictures furnished by the petitioners and noted that there were “glaring examples of misuse of the generous permission granted under the Guidelines to prune trees/tree branches having a girth upto 15.7 cms”.\n“The occasion to the Tree Officer to inspect or assess the health of the trees, the necessity or justification for pruning has been sought to be scuttled and taken away by the Guidelines. What is the scientific methodology employed to measure that the pruning was done only upto a girth 15.7 cms and not beyond, is not known or specified. Evidently, it is a mere guesswork. An estimation. The Guidelines are not a statutory enactment or an amendment of the statute. They cannot abridge the mandate of the statute. Even a Regulation or Rule, which are creatures of a statute cannot limit, undo or transgress the powers, objective and mandate of the statute itself,” the Court observed before setting aside the guidelines under challenge. \nSenior Advocate Vivek Sibal with advocates Anu Monga, Rahul Goel, Shobhit Sharma, Parul Parmar, and Paritosh Dhawan appeared for the petitioners.\nAdditional Standing Counsel (ASC) Shadan Farasat along with advocate Mreganka Kukreja appeared for the Delhi government.\nAdvocate Aditya N Prasad appeared as Amicus Curiae.

Maybe, it would have been prudent for the respondent no.1 to have awaited the outcome of the above-referred petitions before the Supreme Court and before this Court, however, merely for its decision not to wait, the Impugned Order cannot be said to be without jurisdiction or so perverse so as to warrant to be quashed by this Court in exercise of its extra-ordinary jurisdiction.\"\nThe Court further recorded that WhatsApp, Facebook mounted an independent challenge to the Commission's order without moving an application before the Supreme Court and the High Court for clarification, and the same was not maintainable. \nFacebook's stand that an investigation could have been ordered against it was also rejected. \nFacebook and WhatsApp had moved the High Court earlier this month against the CCI order calling for a Director General (DG) probe to ascertain the full extent, scope and impact of data sharing through involuntary consent of users.\nWhatsApp argued that the anti-trust regulator \"jumped the gun\" by starting suo motu proceedings in relation to WhatsApp's privacy policy of 2021 when the issue was pending before two constitutional courts- the Supreme Court and the Delhi High Court.\nIt was contended that privacy was a constitutional issue that could not be gone into by CCI. \nA probe could not be directed against Facebook on the ground that it was a beneficiary of the policy, it was stated. The social media platform also claimed that the order did not meet the requirements of Section 26(1) of the Competition Act.\nCCI defended its order by clarifying that the issue before the regulator was only with respect to the anti-competitive aspect of the policy, and that there was no clash with the courts on issues of privacy.\nCCI was dealing with excessive data collection and the use and sharing of it in an anti-competitive context, it was said. \nThe Court noted that in the present case, the CCI had prima facie concluded that WhatsApp was dominant in the relevant market for Over-the-Top (OTT) messaging apps through smartphones in India and its policy raised anti-competitive issues. \n\"..due to lack of/restricted interoperability between platforms, the users may find it difficult to switch over to other applications except at a significant loss.there is opacity, vagueness, open-endedness and incomplete disclosures in the 2021 Update on vital information categories; concentration of data in WhatsApp and Facebook itself may raise competition concerns; data-sharing amounts to degradation of non-price parameters of competition.\", the Court noted CCI's concerns. \nIn view of the above, the Court stated that it could not be said that CCI acted beyond its jurisdiction. \nEven if some of the issues may substantively be in issue before the Supreme Court and the High Court, there could not be an inviolable rule that CCI would get divested of its jurisdiction in such cases, the Court added. \nThe Court said, \n\"In the present case, the issue as to whether the 2016 Update/2021 Update announced by WhatsApp in any manner infringes upon the Right of Privacy of the users guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India is pending adjudication before the Supreme Court and this Court. The question regarding the 2016 Update/2021 Update not giving an option to opt-out is also an issue before the Supreme Court and this Court. However, the same cannot necessarily mean that during the pendency of those petitions, the respondent no.1 is completely denuded of the jurisdiction vested in it under the Competition Act, 2002 or that it must necessarily await the outcome of such proceedings. Therefore, it is not a question of lack of jurisdiction of the respondent no. 1, but rather one of prudence and discretion.\"\nThe challenge was accordingly dismissed. \nAdditional Solicitor General Aman Lekhi appeared for CCI.

The applicant has been in judicial custody in the matter since 01.10.2020. The applicant cannot be made to incarcerate in jail for infinity merely on account of the fact that other persons who were part of the riotous mob have to be identified and arrested in the matter.\", the Court ruled. \nAmongst other bail conditions, Additional Sessions Judge Vinod Yadav of the Karkardooma Court directed Umar Khalid to install the Aarogya Setu app on his phone upon his release. \nThe other bail conditions are that Khalid shall not tamper with evidence or influence any witness in any manner and shall maintain peace and harmony in the locality. \nKhalid has also been directed to appear before the Court on each and every date of hearing and is also required to furnish his mobile number to SHO, PS Khajuri Khas upon his release from the jail.\nKhalid was granted bail on his furnishing a personal bond in the sum of Rs 20,000 with one surety of the like amount.\nThe present FIR was registered with respect to the violence that broke out at the main Karawal Nagar Road, near Chand Bagh Pulia on February 24, 2020. \nThe case concerns the rioting which took place at or around the house of main accused Tahir Hussain.\nBesides seeking bail on grounds of parity with other co-accused, Khalid argued that he had been falsely implicated in the matter by the investigating agency on account of “political vendetta to muzzle the dissent”.\nIt was submitted that neither was he present at the scene of crime on the date of the incident nor was there material on record to show that there was any meeting took place between Tahir Hussain and him.\nThe offence of “criminal conspiracy” was already a subject matter of another FIR and therefore, Khalid could not be prosecuted for the same offence twice, it was submitted. \nIt was inter alia argued that the investigation in the matter was complete and no useful purpose would be served keeping him behind bars in the matter as the trial was likely to take a long time.\nThe Prosecution, on the other hand, claimed that the “common object” of the accused persons was to cause maximum damage to the persons and property(ies) of other community. Since co-accused persons in the matter were very well known to Khalid, there was quick “meeting of minds” in the case, it was added. \nOpposing the bail, the Prosecution argued that investigation of the case was still in progresses many persons who were part of the “riotous mob” were yet to be identified and arrested.\n The “conspiracy angle” behind such a large-scale riot needed to be unearthed, it was further contended. \nThe Court noted that it was not the prosecution's case that Khalid was physically present at the scene. \nKhalid had prima facie been roped in the matter on basis of his own disclosure statement and that of co-accused persons' Tahir Hussain and Khalid Saifi.\nOpining that it did not find any rationale in the act of police in involving Khalid in the present FIR for the offence of conspiracy, the Court observed, \n\"Even no recovery of any sort has been effected from the applicant pursuant to his disclosure statement.Be that as it may, it is relevant to note here that said PW Rahul Kasana is also a witness in case FIR No.59/2020, in which case also the “criminal conspiracy” angle is being investigated by Special Cell of Delhi Police. In the said case the statement under Section 161 Cr.P.C of PW Rahul Kasana was recorded on 21.05.2020, on which date he did not utter a single word against the applicant qua “criminal conspiracy” and now all of a sudden, he vide his statement recorded under Section 161 Cr.P.C in the matter on 27.09.2020 blew the trumpet of “criminal conspiracy” against the applicant. This prima facie does not appeal to the senses...\nI find absolutely no substance in the argument of learned Special PP that in a case of criminal conspiracy, the disclosure statement of co-accused can be read against another co-accused, merely on the ground that pursuant thereto the CDRs of co-accused were unearthed which led to the recovery of fact of meeting dated 08.01.2020.The sole evidence of this so called conspiracy is a statement of PW Rahul Kasana, wherein he stated on 27.09.2020 that he was standing outside a building in the area of Shaheen Bagh, where he had dropped principal accused Tahir Hussain and thereafter he saw applicant and Khalid Saifi going into the same building.

{"ID": "id_951", "Summary": "The Supreme Court last week upheld the constitutional validity of the provisions of the Kerala Motor Vehicles Taxation Act, 1976 and the Kerala Motor Transport Workers’ Welfare Fund Act, 1985, which club the mandatory nature of paying motor vehicle tax with contribution to the worker welfare fund for the sector [All Kerala Distributors Association Kottayam v State of Kerala & Anr.]\nA bench of Justices AM Khanwilkar, AS Oka, and CT Ravikumar held that the provisions in question are not inconsistent with the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 enacted by the parliament. \n\"A priori, we have no hesitation in concluding that the provisions of the 1976 Act and the 1985 Act, enacted by the State Legislature, are only intended to ensure that the vehicle owner/permit-holder does not remain in arrears of either the welfare fund contribution or the vehicle tax both payable under the State enactments. These provisions are in no way in conflict with the law made by the Parliament (1988 Act). The State enactments do not create any new liability or obligation in relation to the permit issued under the 1988 Act (Central legislation), but it provides for dispensation to ensure timely collection of the welfare fund contribution as well as vehicle tax payable by the same vehicle owner/permit-holder\", the judgment stated.\nThe top court was hearing appeals challenging a 2007 judgment of the Kerala High Court, which had upheld the Constitutional validity of Sections 4(7), 4(8) and 15 of Motor Vehicles Taxation Act and Section 8A of the Kerala Motor Transport Workers' Welfare Fund Act. \nIn the year 2005, the State of Kerala amended the 1976 Act and the 1985 Act thereby introducing sub-sections (7) and (8) of Section 4 in the 1976 Act and Section 8A in the 1985 Act. The effect of these amendments was to mandate production of receipt of remittance of welfare fund contribution at the time of making payment of vehicle tax before the taxation officer.\nThe primary contention was that the State's laws had effectively bootstrapped the obligation to make contribution to the workers’ welfare fund with that of mandatorily paying tax towards using motor vehicles.\nThe top court said that the legislative intent of the Kerala laws must be recognised as being a beneficial legislation towards compliance with welfare fund contributions to protect workers, specially those in the unorganised sector, engaged in commercial motor operations.\n\"Neither the provisions of the 1985 Act or the 1976 Act have the effect of interdicting the permit issued under the 1988 Act. The real intent and purpose behind these provisions is to restate the mandate stated in the 1988 Act that the vehicle cannot be used on road without a valid permit and payment of vehicle tax up to date,\" the Court said in its judgment.\nOn the question of their repugnancy with respect to the Central legislation, the Court noted that the Motor Vehicles Act does not deal with levy of vehicle tax or its collection.\n\"If so, it is not possible to hold that there is direct conflict between the two provisions, namely, in the law made by the Parliament and by the State Legislature. Furthermore, on analysing the legislative intent and the efficacy of the impugned provisions enacted by the State Legislature concerning the manner of levy of vehicle tax and collection thereof, it will be amply clear that obedience to each of the laws (made by the Parliament and State Legislature) is possible without disobeying the other,\" the bench stated.\nFurther, it stated that States have every right to levy cesses to be used for other purposes. \n\"The liability of the vehicle owner/permit-holder to pay welfare fund contribution as well as to pay vehicle tax arises under the legislation enacted by the State Legislature. As such, there is nothing wrong in State Legislature making it compulsory to pay outstanding welfare fund contribution first before accepting the vehicle tax which had become due and payable,\" the bench explained. \nThe bench also underscored that that the objective of the laws was to ensure that commercial vehicle owners do not remain in arrears of the welfare fund contribution or the vehicle taxes payable under State enactments.\n\"The State enactments do not create any new liability or obligation in relation to the permit issued under the 1988 Act (Central legislation), but it provides for dispensation to ensure timely collection of the welfare fund contribution as well as vehicle tax payable by the same vehicle owner/permit-holder,\" the judgment stated."}
{"ID": "id_952", "Summary": "Chief Justice of India NV Ramana on Saturday advised disputing parties to treat litigation as a last resort, and to approach courts only after exploring alternate dispute resolution (ADR) methods such as arbitration, mediation and conciliation.\nThe Chief Justice was speaking at the Curtain Raiser and Stakeholders' Conclave of The International Arbitration and Mediation Centre, Hyderabad at the Hyderabad International Convention Centre (HICC).\nAt the outset, CJI Ramana chose to retell a story from the Mahabharata. He pointed out an early attempt at mediation as a conflict resolution tool when Lord Krishna attempted to mediate between the Pandavas and Kauravas.\n“It may be worthwhile to recall that the failure of mediation led to disastrous consequences,” he cautioned.\nHe noted that the reasons for conflict may be many, such as misunderstandings, ego issues, trust, greed, and even small differences. However, he assured that even big conflicts can be resolved with some effort in understanding one other and having the right attitude.\n“By right attitude, I mean we should leave aside our ego, emotions, impatience and embrace practicality. But once these conflicts enter a court, much gets lost in the practice and procedure.”\nCJI NV Ramana found it important to point out some benefits of mediation and arbitration over traditional litigation, which are the preferred modes of dispute resolution. He stated that these reasons included fewer delays, lesser costs, more involvement of the parties in the process, greater party choice, more control, and a more comfortable environment for the parties.\nAdditionally, he pointed out the following advantages to mediation: allows for settlements, ensures there is no winner or loser, far more control over the outcome, possibility of a continued relationship between parties after the dispute resolution process and greater options for choice of mediator with varied expertise, as there is no requirement for a legally-trained mediator.\nThe CJI explained that despite the presence of some arbitration centres in India, Indian parties that enter into international arbitration often opt for arbitration centres outside the country. The setting up of the IAMC at Hyderabad will change this trend, he said.\n“This Centre is being established with the best infrastructure and the empaneling of internationally acclaimed arbitrators and mediators. Best practices from across the world are being taken into consideration to ensure efficient functioning of the Centre and for drafting of the rules. With a global perspective and an emphasis on quality, I can assure you that it would soon be comparable to Arbitral Institutions like SIAC.”\nHe concluded his address on a hopeful note, expressing his certainty that the Centre will be a boon for the arbitration and mediation landscape in India."}
{"ID": "id_955", "Summary": "The Chhattisgarh High Court recently commuted to life imprisonment the death penalty earlier awarded by the trial court to a man (appellant) convicted of kidnapping, sexually assaulting, and murdering a 4-year-old child in 2015 [In Reference of State of Chhattisgarh].\nThe High Court reduced the sentence after noting that the orders passed by the trial court convicting the appellant and sentencing him to death were delivered on the same day.\nAmong other factors, the Court observed that the appellant was not given an effective opportunity of hearing on the question of sentence. \nThe Court also found that no evidence was brought on record to prove that the appellant was beyond reformation. \n\"It is quite vivid that the Trial Court has convicted the Appellant and sentenced him to death on the same date, i.e., 30.10.2018. The Trial Court has not taken into consideration the probability of the Appellant to be reformed and rehabilitated and only took into consideration the crime and the manner in which it was committed by the Appellant. The Trial Court has also not given effective opportunity of hearing to the Appellant on the question of sentence,\" the Court said. \nThe judges further took into consideration that the reports from the jail where the appellant was placed, indicated that his behaviour was good and that he had committed no further offences while in jail. \nThe bench also observed that the appellant was young, around 20 years of age, when the offence was committed. \nHe is also a member of the Scheduled Caste/ Scheduled Tribe and the chances of him being reformed and rehabilitated cannot be ruled out, the Court opined. \nAfter careful deliberation, the Court believed that the imposition of the maximum penalty of capital punishment was unjustified in this case.\nHence, the bench of Justices Sanjay K Agrawal and Arvind Singh Chandel decided to commute his death sentence to one of life imprisonment. \n\"We are of the view that this is not the rarest of the rare cases in which major penalty of death has to be confirmed. In our view, imprisonment for life would completely be adequate and would meet the ends of justice. Accordingly, we direct commutation of death sentence into imprisonment for life,\" the Court's order stated. \nThe Court clarified that the life sentence would mean that the appellant would remain imprisoned for the remainder of his natural life. \nThe Court passed the ruling on a reference made to confirm the trial court's death sentence, as required under Section 366 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). \nAlong with this reference, the Court also heard the appeal challenging the conviction and death sentence awarded to the appellant.\nThe appellant had been convicted for murder, rape and kidnapping under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) as well as aggravated penetrative sexual assault under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO Act).\nThe appellant's counsel asserted that the trial court had convicted him without there being sufficient and clinching evidence on record. \nThe Court, however, dismissed the appeal in so far as the conviction of the appellant was concerned. \n\"The conviction of the Appellant under Sections 363, 376(2)(i) and 302 of the Indian Penal Code and Section 6 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act is confirmed, but, his sentence of death is commuted to imprisonment for life by maintaining the fine amount,\" the Court ordered.\nThe appellant was represented by advocates DK Gwalre and Reena Singh.

{"ID": "id_959", "Summary": "The Bombay High Court has upheld the bail granted to Areeb Majeed, who is accused of joining global terror outfit ISIS.\nWhile doing so, the Court set aside on merits the findings of the Special Court in Mumbai hearing cases being investigated by the National Investigation Agency (NIA).\nThe Bench of Justices SS Shinde and Manish Pitale passed the verdict in an appeal by the NIA against the Special Court’s order which granted bail to Majeed on merits.\nThe Court opined the observations of the Special Court that no prima facie case is made out by the NIA in light of witnesses examined is based on flawed logic.\n\"It is strange that the NIA Court had held that “at this stage” the prosecution had not succeeded to prove prima facie case on the basis of examination of 49 witnesses and that the prosecution had failed to give a specific direction.\" the order states.\nThe Court noted that the accusations against Majeed had been rendered twice over against Majeed when the earlier bail applications were rejected on merits, which was not considered in the impugned order.\nHaving held so, the Court proceeded to add that considering Majeed was facing trial for serious and heinous offences, the Court was required to \"perform a balancing act, so as to ensure that a golden mean is reached between the rights of the individual and those of the society at large.\"\nThe Court considered the fact that Majeed had been detained for more than 6 years. It also noted that examining 51 witnesses took 5 years and there were 107 more witnesses to be examined which would most likely not conclude within 6 months. \nTaking this into account, the Court deduced that there is every likelihood of the trial continuing for the next few years and for this reason, the Court held that bail can be granted to Majeed subject to stringent conditions.\n\"If ultimately, the accused are found to be not guilty, the number of years, months and days spent by such accused as undertrials in jail, can never be given back to them and this is certainly a violation of their valuable right under Article 21 of the Constitution of India.\" the Court observed.\nMajeed will be released on bail upon furnishing a bail bond of Rs. 1 lakh. He has been directed to stay with his family at Kalyan, Thane and submit a list of 3 blood relatives having permanent abode in Kalyan or Mumbai suburbs. \nMajeed has to report once a week to the in-charge NIA officer and produce the proof before the relevant court on relevant dates. \nHe has also been directed to report to the Kalyan police station twice in a day for first two month, then once a day for two months, thereafter thrice a week for the next two months, and ultimately twice a week till pendency of the trial. \nHe has also been restrained from making any statements pertaining to the pending proceedings to any form of media including the print and electronic media and social media. \nSoon after the order was passed, Additional Solicitor General Anil Singh requested for a stay on the order. However, the Court refused to grant the request considering the stringent conditions that had been imposed upon him.\nMajeed, who travelled to Syria to allegedly join ISIS, was arrested in November 2014 under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) after he returned from Syria.\nHe was charged with the commission of offences under Section 125 (waging war against government) of the Indian Penal Code as well as Section 16 (punishment for terrorist act) and Section 18 (punishment for conspiracy) of the UAPA.\nASG Singh argued before the Court that NIA had found enough evidence against Majeed which was present in the chargesheet and the supplementary chargesheets.\nSingh argued that Majeed, being a hardcore follower of ISIS, travelled back to India with an ulterior motive to carry out unlawful activities.\nHe claimed that participation in terrorist activities was serious and that there was material available in support of his activities.\nMajeed, arguing in-person, contended that the trial was being conducted for offences which were neither within Indian borders nor against India. He claimed that the evidence collected by NIA could not prima facie prove the offences charged by them.\nHe further submitted that the offences for which he has been charged with entail punishment of only upto five years' imprisonment since he has not caused any injury or killed anyone. The chargesheet itself discloses these facts, he contended.\nHe highlighted that he has already spent more than six years in jail as an undertrial and that in itself is a ground for grant of bail. In this regard, he placed reliance upon the recent judgment of the Supreme Court in the Union of India v. KA Najeeb.\nIt was also his argument that he had gone abroad to help people there and not for any terrorist activities.\nThe Court at this point questioned why a 21-year-old boy would think of going to Iraq leaving his parents and family in grief. It also remarked that if Majeed would have utilised his abilities to the best at the age of 21, it would have been a matter of joy for the family and for the country."}

In any case, at the highest, this dispute is between the partners inter se and for that criminal offence is not made out,” the Court held.\nThe case arose from a complaint by Oberoi’s company, Oberoi Mega Entertainment LLP through its authorised representative Chartered Accountant Deven Bafna.\nAs per the first information report (FIR), Vivek Oberoi had gotten acquainted with one Sanjay Saha in February 2020 and decided to establish a firm. Both of them agreed on certain clauses. Oberoi invested ₹27 lakh and was to get 33.33% of shares. \nThe applicant-accused Nandita Saha is mother of Sanjay Saha. Both of them were to get 33.34% shares and balance 33.33% shares were to be given to the applicant Raadhika Nanda. \nA separate firm by the name Anandita Entertainment LLP was then formed. However, as per the FIR, Oberoi was cheated of his money to the tune of ₹1.55 crore.\nThe main allegation against the two accused women was that ₹5 lakh was invested in Tata AIG Life Insurance in Nandita Saha’s name and ₹10 lakh was taken by Raadhika for her salary.\nWhile Sanjay Saha is presently in judicial custody the two accused Nandita and Raadhika approached the sessions court for anticipatory bail. \nAfter sessions court rejected the application, the two women approached High Court. \nThe applicants contended that the FIR clearly indicated that all decisions were taken by Sanjay Saha. \nThey argued that the agreement contained clauses for welfare of partners, as per which all partners had rights, title and interests in all assets and properties in proportion to their profit sharing ratio. \nThey could draw remuneration subject to profit of the firm and approval of all partners.

Merely because such sexual abuse results in tying of knot between the victim and the accused in violation of provisions of law or results in birth of a child, it does not mitigate the act of the petitioner (accused) in any manner, since the consent of a minor is immaterial and inconsequential in law,” the Court held.\nThe Court, therefore, denied bail to a 27-year-old man accused under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO Act) for sexually exploiting a minor girl though he had, subsequently, married her.\nIt was stated that the man had lured the 15-year-old girl in July 2019. Though her parents registered a complaint with the police and a Habeas Corpus petition was also filed, she could only be traced in October 2021 with an eight-month-old child. Her Urine Pregnancy Test (UPT) further revealed that she was pregnant for a second time.\nPolice alleged that the accused had misled the investigation by suppressing the whereabouts of the victim and kept the entire machinery in dark. \nThe accused claimed that he had married the girl in a temple and the relationship was consensual and even the alleged victim had not opposed his bail plea.\nHowever, Justice Mendiratta held that child marriage is prohibited under the law and sexual intercourse with wife under the age of 18 years regardless of her willingness or consent, is rape.\nThe judge added that the girl's infatuation with the alleged kidnapper cannot be permitted as a valid defence as it would amount to undermining the essence of legislative intent of Section 361 (kidnapping) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).\n“Such incidents of luring a minor and entering into physical relationship, accused thereafter claiming consent of the minor, cannot be treated in a routine manner, since rape is not only a crime against the minor victim but is a crime against the entire society which leaves little option for the minor child but to toe the line of the petitioner/accused,” the Court said.\nAdvocates Lokesh Kumar Mishra, Himanshu Sharma and Haider Khan appeared for the petitioner.\nAdditional Public Prosecutor (APP) Laksh Khanna appeared for the State.\nAdvocates Supriya Juneja and Adhishwar Suri appeared for the complainant."}

It is an admitted position that the present Rules under challenge are exactly the same as were under challenge before the Apex Court,\" the Court held.\nThe High Court found that the age criteria has a rational and reasonable nexus with the intent of the Rules, towards ensuring that the candidates have both maturity and experience to become District Judges.\nIt took note of Supreme Court judgments in Madras Bar Association and Devina Sharma to observe that though the Constitution does not specify an age requirement for district judges, it does not disentitle State to prescribe such criterion.\nMoreover, in Devina Sharma the top court explained the rationale for such criteria by stating it ensures that the candidates have the experience as well maturity, the Bench noted. The Bench emphasised that under Article 141, Supreme Court decisions are binding on all other Courts.\nOn whether the order would be appealed to the Supreme Court, the counsel for the petitioner told Bar and Bench that they have not taken a call yet on the same.\nCounsel for the respondents submitted that the question before the Court is no longer res integra as a decision on the said subject has been given by the Supreme Court in Devina Sharma.\nThe Bench in the instant case noted at the outset that Article 233(1), which prescribes appointment of District Judges, has to be read with Article 235 that mandates that the control over lower courts vest with the High Court. \n\"Merely because the Constitution is silent on the minimum age would not mean that those entrusted with the Rule making power cannot make such provision,\" the Court made it clear.\nRelying on Hirandra Kumar vs High Court of Judicature at Allahabad & Anr, the High Court dismissed the challenge under Article 14 after reiterating that the criteria involved are a policy decision and in line with the Shetty Commission recommendations. \nThe petitioner, advocate Pooja Agarwal, appearing in person, had stated during hearings that the said minimum age criteria is illegal as neither the Constitution nor the rules in other States provide for the same.\nRule 7 of the Assam Judicial Service Rules provides that for direct recruitment, among other qualifications, the candidate must be at least 35 years of age, but under 45.\nThis stipulation, the petitioner had argued, was \"contrary to Article 233 of the Constitution of India which clearly provides that no person shall be eligible to be appointed as a District Judge if he has been for not less than 7 years an advocate or pleader.\"\nArticle 233 clarifies that no age criteria has been provided and the only eligibility criteria given is that the candidate needs to have seven years of practice as an advocate, it was stated.\nArguing that there is \"no rationale\" behind this Rule, the petitioner had stated that the minimum age requirement is violative of Articles 14 and 15 of the Constitution \"as it leads to discrimination on the basis of age as the law has been laid down by the Hon’ble Apex Court in a catena of cases.\"\nMoreover, the said requirement even \"precludes otherwise qualified candidates possessing the requisite experience from appointment to the Grade I post,\" the plea had said.\nThe petitioner had highlighted how, in the ordinary career of a law graduate, they would have completed the seven years of practice needed for district judges by age 31. By age 35, they would be eligible for appointment as High Court judges, having completed the minimum 10-year experience needed.\nThe Assam Rules effectively mean that candidates in Delhi and Karnataka have longer tenures with the judiciary, it was pointed out.\nSenior Advocate Unni Krishnan Nair appeared for the respondent-State, and the High Court as its senior standing counsel."}

Moreover, even the wife and her family had not claimed that the ornaments were given to the husband upon his demand, the Court observed. \nThe husband agreed to hand over the gold ornaments in question to his wife, who expressed her willingness to accept the same.\nThe Court set aside the order of the Dowry Prohibition Officer and allowed the petition."}

Furthermore, the final relief sought in the writ petition has been granted as an interim measure, which again is impermissible in view of the law laid down by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the State of U.P and others v.

{"ID": "id_969", "Summary": "The Delhi High Court recently awarded damages of ₹3 lakh in favour of the manufacturers of Rajnigandha Pan Masala, while permanently restraining the makers of 'Rajni Paan' from manufacturing, selling, or advertising products under the said trademark. (Dharampal Satyapal Ltd & Anr v. Youssef Anis Mehio & Ors)\nJustice Jyoti Singh restrained the manufacturers of 'Rajni Paan' from indulging in infringement, dilution of Rajnigandha's trademark and trade name, passing off, infringement of copyright, and unfair competition.\n\"This Court finds that Defendants have mischievously and deliberately adopted a deceptively similar mark and have only replaced ‘GANDHA’ with PAAN’ with an intention to ride upon goodwill and reputation established by the Plaintiffs,\" the Court held.\nDharampal Satyapal Limited, the proprietors of Rajnigandha Pan Masala, had filed a suit seeking a permanent injunction to restrain the defendants from the manufacture, sale and advertisement of any tobacco products or any other goods and services using the marks 'Rajni', 'Rajnigandha', 'Rajni Paan', etc.\nOn November 29, 2018, the Court passed an interim injunction in favour of Rajnigandha. Despite service of summons to the defendants through several modes, they did not appear before the Court.\nUpon careful examination of the two products, the Court observed that the imitation, adoption and use of the nearly identical trademark, trade name logo, and colour scheme by the proprietors of 'Rajni Paan' was done with the intent to cause confusion and create an impression amongst consumers that they have a direct affiliation with the plaintiffs or were licensed or endorsed by them.\n\"It is a settled proposition of law that if the Court finds that there is imitation, no further evidence is required to establish that Plaintiffs’ rights are violated,\" the Court said in this context.\nFurther, the Court observed that since 'Rajnigandha' was a well-known mark, as defined under Section 2(1)(zg) of the Trademarks Act, the same shall be entitled to a high degree of protection even in cases of dissimilar goods.\nThe Court added that the principle of ‘initial interest confusion' would also be attracted here, as the case rested on the assumption that infringement may be based upon confusion which creates initial consumer interest, even if no actual sale was made due to that confusion.\nThe order also stated that since no stocks were recovered or seized from the premises by the Local Commissioner appointed by the Court, the prayer for damages could not be entertained.\nHowever, in light of the facts that the defendants were guilty of infringement, and that they have chosen to deliberately stay away from the proceedings, the Court held that the plaintiff was entitled to notional damages.

{"ID": "id_976", "Summary": "The Supreme Court recently referred to larger bench the issue of whether liberty granted by the Supreme Court to approach the High Court in review automatically places a matter in the escalation matrix, and makes the remedy of Special Leave Petition (SLP) available again [S Narhari and Others v. SR Kumar and Others].\nA Division Bench of Justices Krishna Murari and Sanjay Karol referred the question to a larger bench. \nThe issue framed was: whether liberty granted by this Court to approach the High Court in review, automatically places the said matter in the escalation matrix, and makes the remedy of Special Leave Petition available again?\nThe Court was hearing a property dispute where both parties agreed to a compromise. Subsequently, the heirs of one of the parties (respondents in this case) sued the other party seeking an injunction. The trial court in 2002 dismissed the suit and ruled that the compromise decree was binding on the respondents.\nThe respondents moved the Karnataka High Court in appeal. During the course of the proceedings, an application for revision of the plaint and recovery of custody of property was moved by the respondents under Order VI Rule 17 of the Civil Procedure Code 1908 (CPC). The High Court remanded the matter to the trial court for a decision on the limited issue of additional relief of possession of part of the suit property.\nAggrieved by this order, the appellant moved an SLP before the Supreme Court. However, during the pendency of the same, the trial court proceeded with the matter. On October 29, 2011, the trial court ruled in favor of the respondents on the limited issue of additional relief.\nThe appellants then moved the High Court. Meanwhile, on January 3, 2013, the top court dismissed the earlier SLP on the ground that the relief prayed for was exhausted.\nWhile dismissing the SLP, the top court stated that because the first appeal against the order dated October 29, 2011 was still pending before the High Court, the appellant was free to raise all questions pertaining to the remand.\nHowever, the first appeal was dismissed by the High Court on December 20, 2019. Aggrieved, the appellant moved another SLP before the top court. The same was dismissed by the top court as withdrawn. The Court, however, gave liberty to the appellant to file a review petition before the High Court.\nThe review plea was also dismissed on July 15, 2022. Challenging the said order, the appellant preferred the present SLP before the top court.\nThe respondents questioned the maintainability of the SLP. It was argued that as per Order XLVII Rule 7 CPC, an SLP against an order passed in review is not maintainable.\nMoreover, while dismissing the original SLP filed by the appellants, while the top court granted liberty to the appellants to approach the High Court in review, it did not give the appellants specific permission to file a subsequent SLP before the top court again assailing that order.\nIn its analysis, the top court noted that Order XLVII Rule 7 CPC makes it amply clear that no SLP can be filed against an order passed in review, and as such, the contention of the respondents is accepted.\nHowever, considering the case, the Court framed the limited question of law for consideration of a larger bench.\nThe Court referred to precedents on the issue including Vinod Kapoor v. State of Goa (2012) and Sandhya Education Society v. Union of India (2014). These cases had a similar set of circumstances, where consecutive SLPs were filed and the order in the original SLP only gave an explicit liberty to approach the High Court. In these cases, the top court held that the subsequent SLP was not maintainable.\nHowever, contrary to the above decisions, the Court in Khoday Distilleries Limted v. Sri Mahadeshwara Sahakara Sakkare Karkhane Limited (2019) held that that the doctrine of merger is not applicable in cases where the dismissal of SLP is by way of a non-speaking order. The Bench found that if this decision is applied in present case, the SLP would be maintainable.\n\"In simpler terms, this would essentially mean that even in cases where the Special Leave Petition was dismissed as withdrawn, where no reason was assigned by the Court while dismissing the matter and where leave was not granted in the said Special Leave Petition, the said dismissal would not be considered as laying down law within the ambit of Article 141 of the Constitution of India,\" the Court observed.\nIt went on to note,\n\"If a dismissal of Special Leave Petition by way of a nonspeaking order is not considered law under Article 141 of Constitution of India, the same also cannot be considered as res judicata, and therefore, in every such dismissal, even in cases where the dismissal is by way of a withdrawal, the remedy of filing a fresh Special Leave Petition would still persist. Further, if on the said reasoning, a remedy to file a review in the High Court is allowed, then the same reasoning cannot arbitrarily exclude the filing of a subsequent Special Leave Petition.\"\nEven while noting that such an interpretation would open the floodgates of litigation, and would essentially mean that every dismissal of an SLP must be accompanied with reasons, the Court deemed it fit to refer the issue to a larger bench."}

Suspicion, howsoever high, cannot take the place of proof of guilt. Accordingly, appellant is entitled to the benefit of doubt and ought to be acquitted,\" the Court said. \nThe case dated back to 2013, when two girls aged about 18 years and 5 years old, who were the sister and daughter of the informant respectively, were attacked with acid in their house at night.\nTwo men alleged to have had teased the informant's sister earlier were accused of the crime. As per the informant, her sister had turned down a marriage proposal from one of the accused. In retaliation, the accused allegedly threatened that he would make the girl's condition such that no one else would marry her and that human beings would be frightened by seeing her face, the informant had alleged.\nOn account of this, her parents had stopped the informant's sister from going to school or on the road, and arranged for her marriage, the Court was further told. The informant claimed that the accused had thrown acid on her sister and daughter on coming to know of her sister's betrothal.\nThe trial court's conviction in the matter was challenged by one of the accused before the High Court, who pleaded innocence in the case and contended that he had been falsely implicated. The appellant argued that none of the witnesses could explain how the accused could have entered the house at night when the incident took place. There were no eyewitnesses and the trial court had based its conviction on conjectures and surmises alone, the appellant submitted.\nThe High Court noted that while the trial court had relied on the version of various witnesses to the case, most of the witnesses had turned hostile. \n\"Even the family members of victims who were present at the place of occurrence did not support the case of the prosecution,\" the High Court found. \nSince the case rested on circumstantial evidence, the circumstances put forth should be consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused, the Court observed. However, in this case, the High Court found that contradictory versions of the incident, as well as hostile witnesses, marred the prosecution's case. \n\"I am fully convinced with the arguments of the learned Advocate though the victims suffered acid burn injuries but who is actual culprit is not brought on record by the prosecution,\" the Court concluded. \nThe Court further pointed out that the suspicions of the prosecution in the matter is not sufficient to incriminate the accused. \n\"How appellant and his friend entered the room at night where the victims were sleeping and how they threw acid on them is not clear from the prosecution witnesses. Their suspicion or belief do not constitute proof,\" the Court said. \nTherefore, the High Court acquitted the appellant. The benefit of this acquittal was also extended by the Court to the co-accused who had not challenged the trial court order. \n\"... he stands on the same footing with the appellant. Hence, in the interest of justice, he ought to be extended the same relief and acquitted of the charge levelled against him in view of the law declared in Sahadevan & Anr. Vs.

Since the RIL promoters and Persons Acting in Concert (PACs) did not make any public announcement for acquiring shares, it was found that the Ambanis violated the provisions of Regulation 11(1).\n\"...I hold that the Noticees by not making a public announcement have violated and have been continuing to violate the provisions of Regulation 11(1) of the Takeover Regulations,\" the order passed by AO K Saravanan today stated. \nPursuant to the investigation, adjudication proceedings were initiated in 2011 against 36 RIL promoters and PACs, including Mukesh and Anil, their wives Nita and Tina, as well Akash and Isha, the children of Mukesh and Nita Ambani.\nBefore the AO, the Ambanis had contended that initiation of adjudication proceedings against the noticees, seventeen years after the acquisition of the warrants and eleven years after the acquisition of shares was unreasonable and time-barred. The other contentions made in their defence included:\nThe provisions of the 1997 Takeover Regulations are not applicable to the issue of warrants and conversion of warrants;\nThe acquisition of shares by was exempt under Regulation 3(1)(c) of the 1997 Takeover Regulations;\nThe noticees were not provided with a full inspection of documents in complete violation of the principles of natural justice.\nPrior to giving his reasons for the order, the AO noted that there are various other aspects pertaining to the investigation relating to violations spanning from the SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 1995, and Section 77(2) and 77A of the Companies Act, 1956. However, the present order, he said, would be limited to alleged violation of the Takeover Regulations.\nWith regard to the delay in proceedings, the AO noted that the noticees had opted for settlement in August 2011, after which the matter was kept at abeyance. However, since they were not agreeable to the terms of the settlement arrived at in accordance with the Regulations, the settlement applications were rejected in May 2020, after which adjudicatory proceedings before the AO resumed. Thus, the AO found that there was no delay, noting,\n\"In any event, even the delay, as argued, is not relevant to the present proceeding as the violation is a substantive violation in the nature of an \"economic offence\".\"\nFurther, it was held that the Ambanis and others committed a serious violation against the investors which has a \"public flavour\". \n\"Thus the delay, if any, by SEBI is of no consequence where public interest outweighs the requirement of adjudication,\" the order said.\nThe AO dismissed the contention of violation of principles of natural justice holding that all relevant documents were provided to the noticees. \n\"Since all the documents which are relevant and relied upon in the instant proceedings have been provided to the Noticees, I am of the opinion that principles of natural justice have been duly complied with in the instant proceedings and no prejudice in filing reply has been caused to the Noticees,\" the order said. \nThe AO also rejected the contention that the provisions of the Takeover Regulations were not applicable to the present case.\nThe Ambanis were also found to be in violation of regulations requiring the filing of disclosures pertaining to the allotment of RIL shares in 2000.\n\"...the failure to file the disclosures under Regulation 3(1)(c) of the Takeover Regulations was not just a technical violation but a deliberate concealment of important facts from the share-holders, for if such a resolution existed or if the Noticees had any desire of even subsequently informing share-holders about the identity before the allotment that they were the intended shareholders, they would have done so and claimed exemption. \nAs discussed previously, compliance with the requirements of Regulation 3(1)(c) is necessary to claim exemption from making public announcement under Regulation 11(1) of the Takeover Regulations. Thus, the resulting failure to make the public announcement and the non-compliance of the open offer obligation being absolute and continuing in nature, was in violation of the requirement of Regulation 11(1) of the Takeover Regulations,\" SEBI held. \nThe AO proceeded to place reliance on a number of the Supreme Court judgments to hold as follows:\n\"I note that the SEBI Act, 1992 is a social welfare legislation for the protection of investors and it is the paramount duty to interpret its provisions and to adopt such an interpretation that would further the purposes of law and if possible, eschew the one which frustrates it. Hence, it is necessary to uphold the obligation to give a public announcement of open offer to investors at large which obligation has not been complied with till date. Acceptance of any argument for not making a public announcement of an open offer would tantamount to total disregard to the concerns of the public share-holders as the violation is not one of mere procedural nature but goes against the very grain of the statue under consideration.\"\nFor these reasons, among others, the AO deemed it fit to slap a penalty of Rs 25 crore to be paid jointly by the Ambanis and others. They are required to make the payment within 45 days of the order, failing which SEBI can initiate recovery proceedings and realize the amount by attachment and sale of the noticees' movable and immovable properties."}

His father had passed away. This fact is not denied by the respondent. As a son, the petitioner will have to participate in the final rites of his father,” the Court said.\nJustice Swaminathan went on to say that even a dead person had a right to a dignified burial or cremation and that the Court must be mindful of the same.\n“Even a dead person must be deemed to possess certain rights. Of course this expression 'rights' will have to be understood contextually. A dead person is entitled to a dignified cremation/burial. This would of course mean that close relatives can participate in the ceremony. This issue can be approached from another perspective. The right to protect one's relative is a guaranteed fundamental right under Article 25 of the Constitution. The petitioner is a Hindu. As a son, he has to discharge certain religious obligations. He has to offer what is known as 'Pinda'. If one is the eldest son, it is he who alone can light the pyre. These are matters of religion and the Court has to have due regard for the same necessarily. While I cannot grant bail, I can certainly issue direction by invoking the inherent power under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure,” the Court said.\nGurumoorthi was arrested and remanded to judicial custody in June last year after he was allegedly found to have 24 kilograms of Ganja. The prosecution opposed his bail application and submitted that the undertrial had two previous cases against him and that it was likely that he would commit another offence while out on bail.\nAdvocate SS Sundarapandian appeared for Gurumoorthi.\nGovernment Counsel (Crl Side) P Kottaichamy appeared for the respondent State government."}

The gratuity payable to an employee shall not exceed the maximum that is notified under the respective enactments as on the date on which the gratuity becomes payable.

[Jiramani Devi Versus State of Jharkhand]\nJustice Sanjay Kumar Dwivedi said that it was an admitted fact that the victim Bramhadev Singh died due to the bullet injury caused by the police, and the closure report filed by the Crime Investigation Deparment (CID) in the matter is a “clear hasty action leaving much to be desired regarding the nature of the investigation”. \n\"Because if a detailed investigation had already been done as is sought to be now suggested, there is no reason why a final report could not have been filed by the investigating agency in the normal course of events and needed an order to do so by the High Court and the court further finds that the closure report, therefore, lacks bona fide and in the interest of justice, the court comes to the conclusion that the case is required to de novo investigation to be done to maintain the confidence of the police upon the society and to suggest that the rule of law is meant for everybody, whoever he may be,\" the Court said.\nHence, the Court set aside the closure report and directed the State Director General of Police (DGP) and State Home Secretary to constitute a fresh team of investigators, which will be headed by a senior police official. \nThe Court said the team shall “consist of efficient personnel, well conversant with use of modern investigation technology also.” It further said that no officer, who was part of the investigation team leading to the closure report, shall be the part of the new team.\nSingh’s wife Jiramani Devi had approached the court in 2021 seeking a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) or Special Branch of CID officers. \nThe Court was told that on June 12 in 2021, about 10-12 tribal men of the Piri Village had gathered in front of the house of one Rajeshwar Singh for hunting as a part of celebrating ‘Nem Sarhul’, an annual tribal celebration in Jharkhand. \nIt was alleged that when the first group of men started moving towards the forest, the security personnel started firing from the other side without any warning.

{"ID": "id_989", "Summary": "The Rajasthan High Court recently held that the rights of a school and its students to receive education in Hindi are protected under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution and cannot be diluted in the absence of a valid legislation [School Development Management Committee v. State of Rajasthan].\nJustice Dinesh Mehta found the State government's move to convert a Hindi medium school to an English medium one violative of Articles 19(1)(a) [freedom of speech and expression] and 14 [equality before the law] of the Constitution.\n“In the opinion of this Court, English, as a medium of instruction cannot be thrust upon a child even by a legislation enacted by the State Government, much less by a policy decision,” the Court said.\nThe single-judge was hearing a petition against the State government’s decision to convert a Hindi medium school catering to the educational needs to about 600 children into English medium.\nThe plea was filed by the School Development Management Committee and its member-parents. When the government refused to act on the representations of the petitioners, they moved the High Court.\nThe counsel for the petitioner at the outset clarified that they were not opposed to English as a medium of instruction, but were aggrieved by the overnight conversion and resultant ouster of students.\nIt was submitted that if the State wished to open more English-medium schools, then it must allocate funds and create new infrastructure for the same since the conversion of the existing schools was an arbitrary exercise.\nIt was brought to the Court’s attention that the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act of 2009 mandate the medium of instruction to be the students' mother tongue.\nThe State on the other hand informed the Court that there were as many as nine government schools within 5 kms of the same school imparting education in Hindi and thus, the petitioners’ stance that their fundamental rights were violated was baseless.\nThe State’s contention was that the establishment of a school, including conversion of schools to English medium, was a policy decision, better left to its discretion.\nThe single-judge concluded that the right to get education in a particular language was relatable to Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution.\n“A child or on his behalf, his parent(s) have the right to choose the language in which his/their child should be imparted education,” concluded the Court.\nThe Court clarified that the State’s decision was not protected under clause (2) [reasonable restriction] of Article 19 since it was purely administrative in nature and did not qualify as “law”.\nJustice Mehta opined that scooping out 601 children “with one stroke of pen” with the assurance that they would be accommodated in nearby schools was violative of their fundamental rights.\n“The same is likely to affect their emotional quotient as well. Because, for children, their school is not only a structure made of stones, cement and concrete – it is a second home or sort of a temple, where they flock to learn; to play and to grow,” the Court explained.\nThe Court criticised the assurance of the State, reasoning that uprooting 601 saplings (students) from the present school to be implanted in nearby schools was not a valid justification, particularly in the middle of the academic session.\nThe Court thus allowed the plea and held that if a majority of the members of the School Development Management Committee resolve that the school be converted to an English-medium school, only then will the State’s decision be given effect to.\nAdvocate Moti Singh appeared for the petitioners while the respondents were represented by the Additional Advocate General Pankaj Sharma with advocates Rishi Soni and Deepak Chandak."}

Thus in this case, it is necessary to balance fundamental rights of the Plaintiff and that of the Defendant.\" the Court said. \nJustice Jamdar held that the allegations in the present case were against Wankhede's son, who is a public officer. \nHe observed that the public has a right to examine and comment on the actions of public officials. However, the same was required to be done after reasonable verification of facts, the Court held.\nConsidering that a balance between fundamental rights was required, although Justice Jamdar held that Wankhede was not entitled to a blanket injunction, prima facie it was found that Malik's actions were \"actuated by malice or personal animosity\".\nThe Court, therefore, directed Malik to publish facts or any matter which may be defamatory of Wankhede \"only after carrying out reasonable verification of the facts\". Malik has raised pertinent issues against Wankhede and it cannot be said that he acted with malice, the Court added.\nThe Court had on November 12, reserved its order on the aspect of interim relief in Dhyandev Wankhede's defamation suit. Through an interim application filed in the case, Wankhede sought a temporary injunction restraining Malik from making any statements in the future about him and his family members.\nThe suit was filed after Malik had shared Sameer Wankhede’s purported birth certificate on his Twitter handle, while allegedly imputing that Wankhede’s father was a Muslim and that his name was ‘Dawood’.\nIn the suit, Dhyandev Wankhede claimed that the tirade against his son started only after Malik’s son-in-law Sameer Khan was arrested by the NCB in January this year for an offence under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 (NDPS Act).\nThe suit filed through Advocates Divakar Rai and Saurabh Tamhankar sought the following prayers:\nOrder declaring that statements made by Malik are \"tortious and defamatory in nature\";\nOrder of permanent injunction restraining Malik from publishing or making statements in any kind of media, including his social media accounts;\nDirections to Malik to delete any statements, press releases, tweets released by Malik;\nDirections to pay damages to the tune of ₹1.25 crore for allegedly making defamatory comments against his son and his family in press conferences and on his social media account.\nIn response, Malik had filed a detailed reply challenging the maintainability of the suit. He had also set out his stance in compliance with the Court's directions asking him to state on record whether he had verified the information against Wankhede before uploading the same on his social media accounts.\nOn the Court's directions, Wankhede's father submitted a 20-page affidavit consisting of 28 documents to show that his name had always been ‘Dynandeo’ and he was from the ‘Mahar’ caste of the Hindu religion."}

{"ID": "id_993", "Summary": "The Madras High Court on Monday upheld the constitutional validity of Section 204 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) which confers powers on the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI) and the Insolvency Professional Agencies to supervise Resolution Professionals (RP) and initiate disciplinary proceedings against them on allegations of misconduct.\nA bench of Chief Justice SV Gangapurwala and Justice D Bharatha Chakravarthy dismissed a petition which sought a declaration that Section 204 of the IBC, and Regulation 23A of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Model Bye-Laws and Governing Board of Insolvency Professional Agencies) Regulations, 2016 (IBBI Regulations) were arbitrary and in breach of constitutional provisions.\nThe bench was hearing two writ petitions filed by a chartered accountant, V Venkata Sivakumar, both of which were decided by a common order. \nSivakumar had claimed that Regulation 23A which provides for the immediate temporary suspension of a Resolution Professional (RP) facing disciplinary proceedings, and Section 204 of the IBC which permits both the IBBI and the Insolvency Professional Agencies (IPAs) to exercise supervisory control and initiate disciplinary proceedings against RPs, provided too much room for misuse.\nThe petitioner also claimed that allocating such powers to more than one agency was bad in law.\nThe bench however, disagreed.\nIt noted that while Section 204 of the IBC grants powers both to the IBBI and the IPAs, both agencies are not permitted to carry out parallel disciplinary proceedings against a Resolution Professional. In other words, the RP would not face action twice for the same offence.\n“Moreover, mere conferment of authority on IBBI and IPAs for supervision control and disciplinary proceedings by itself cannot be held to be conferring of unbridled power. The Regulations and Bye-laws which are framed under Section 204 of the IBC clearly provide checks and balances. The procedure for taking disciplinary action and the appellate remedies are provided. Therefore, it cannot be said to be confirmation of excessive or unbridled power. Section 204 of IBC is only an enabling provision and therefore, we see no constitutional infirmity in any of the provisions under Section 204 (a) (b) (c) (d) and (e) of IBC,” the High Court said.\nThe Court further said that while an RP may have apprehensions about disrepute and mental agony due to a suspension while facing disciplinary proceedings, the provisions of Regulation 23A of the IBBI were essential to check against misconduct.\n“As a matter of fact, Regulation 12 A of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Model Bye-Laws and Governing Board of Insolvency Professional Agencies) Regulations, 2016, categorically provides that the Resolution Professionals should not have any disciplinary proceedings pending against them. If that be the case, it is only logical that there is an ad-interim suspension of AFA if any disciplinary proceedings are initiated subsequently also. The power of ad-interim suspension has always been held to be a valid and natural exercise of power and the only requirement there must be an express rule enabling the same,” the Court added.\nTherefore, the Court proceeded to dismiss both writ petitions. \nCA V Siva Kumar appeared as the petitioner-in-person.\nAdditional Solicitor General R Sankaranarayanan appeared for the Indian Institute of Insolvency Professionals of the ICAI.\nDeputy Solicitor General Rajesh Vivekandandan appeared for the IBBI.\nAdvocates K Subburanga Bharathi and M Sathyan appeared for the Union of India."}
{"ID": "id_994", "Summary": "The Supreme Court recently said that it would attempt to bridge the time gap between illegal actions and the restitution of those who have suffered as a result of said actions (Manoj Kumar v. Union of India)\nA Bench of Justices PS Narasimha and Sandeep Mehta was dealing with a case where a teacher was denied employment on unfair grounds. After noting that the Court was deciding the appeal five years after it was filed, the Bench said,\n\"The delay in this case is not unusual, we see several such cases when our final hearing board moves. Appeals of more than two decades are awaiting consideration. It is distressing but certainly not beyond us. We must and we will find a solution to this problem.\"\nGiven the delays in deciding cases before the apex court, the Bench went on to say,\n\"It is in this reality and prevailing circumstance that we must formulate an appropriate system for preserving the rights of the parties till the final determination takes place. In the alternative, we may also formulate a reasonable equivalent for restitution of the wrongful action.\"\nThe petitioner had applied for the post of primary teacher at Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay institute for the physically handicapped. He was not appointed since he was not given 6 marks for his educational qualifications, as the degree was \"not in the relevant subject.\"\nThough the Court held that the petitioner should have been given the position, it noted that the school had already closed down.\n\"This is an unfortunate situation where the Court finds that the action of the respondent was arbitrary, but the consequential remedy cannot be given due to subsequent developments. One stark reality of the situation is the time that has passed between the order of 2018 impugned herein and the judgment that we pronounce in 2024.\"\nThe Bench went on to note that though courts may set aside administrative actions that may be illegal or arbitrary, this alone may not address the repercussions of abuse of power.\n\"It is equally incumbent upon the courts, as a secondary measure, to address the injurious consequences arising from arbitrary and illegal actions. This concomitant duty to take reasonable measures to restitute the injured is our overarching constitutional purpose.\"\nIt also expressed the difficulty constitutional courts face while identifying appropriate remedial measures, largely owing to the dual variables of time and limited resources. Elaborating further, it said,\n\"The inherent difficulty in bridging the time gap between the illegal impugned action and restitution is certainly not rooted in deficiencies within the law or legal jurisprudence but rather in systemic issues inherent in the adversarial judicial process. The protracted timeline spanning from the filing of a writ petition, service of notice, filing of counter affidavits, final hearing, and then the eventual delivery of judgment, coupled with subsequent appellate procedures, exacerbates delays.\"\nEventually granting relief to the petitioner, it observed,\n\"We appreciate the spirit of the appellant who has steadfastly contested his case like the legendary Vikram, from the year 2017 when he was illegally denied the appointment by the executive order dated 22.05.2017, which we have set aside as being illegal and arbitrary. In these circumstances, we direct the Institute (respondent no. 2) to pay an amount of Rs. 1,00,000/- as compensation.\""}
{"ID": "id_995", "Summary": "Facts sourced from a statement made by accused is admissible as evidence during trial even if such accused is not in the \"formal\" custody of the police, the Supreme Court ruled on Wednesday [Perumal Raja vs State Rep by Inspector of Police].\nA division bench of Justices Sanjiv Khanna and SVN Bhatti stressed that the pre-requisite of police custody under Section 27 of the Evidence Act, should be read pragmatically, rather than formalistically or euphemistically.\nNotably, Section 27 allows for the admission of facts that are discovered from statements made by \"a person accused of any offence, in the custody of a police officer.\"\n\"The expression 'custody' under Section 27 of the Evidence Act does not mean formal custody. It includes any kind of restriction, restraint or even surveillance by the police. Even if the accused was not formally arrested at the time of giving information, the accused ought to be deemed, for all practical purposes, in the custody of the police,\" the Court explained.\nIn doing so, the division bench appeared to disagree with a recent three-judge bench decision in Rajesh & Anr. v. State of Madhya Pradesh, wherein it was held that formal police custody is necessary to make facts obtained from confessions by an accused admissible.\nHowever, the two-judge bench in the present case reasoned that there was a Constitution Bench decision in State of U.P. v. Deoman Upadhyaya reported in 1961 which supported the view that \"formal\" police custody was not necessary. \n\"A person giving word of mouth information to police, which may be used as evidence against him, may be deemed to have submitted himself to the 'custody' of the police officer. Reference can also be made to decision of this Court in Vikram Singh and Ors. v. State of Punjab , which discusses and applies Deoman Upadhyay (supra), to hold that formal arrest is not a necessity for operation of Section 27 of the Evidence Act,\" the division bench added. \nThe top court made the observations while upholding the conviction and life sentence of one Perumal Raja (appellant) accused of murder.\nThe appellant had initially been arrested in connection with the suspected murder of his uncle (a case in which he was later acquitted).\nHowever, after his arrest, the appellant divulged to the police that the deceased man's son (appellant's cousin) who had been missing for some time, was also dead. The appellant also disclosed where the remains of the dead body could be found. \nThe police were able to recover the remains of the cousin's dead body based on this statement. However, a question arose over whether this could be used as evidence against the appellant since he was not formally arrested for his cousin's murder when he made the disclosure statement. \nOn Wednesday, the Supreme Court held that such evidence was admissible and that the accused was, from a practical point of view, under police custody when he made the disclosure statement. \n\"The wide and pragmatic interpretation of the term “police custody” is supported by the fact that if a narrow or technical view is taken, it will be very easy for the police to delay the time of filing the FIR and arrest, and thereby evade the contours of Sections 25 to 27 of the Evidence Act. Thus, in our considered view the correct interpretation would be that as soon as an accused or suspected person comes into the hands of a police officer, he is no longer at liberty and is under a check, and is, therefore, in 'custody' within the meaning of Sections 25 to 27 of the Evidence Act. It is for this reason that the expression 'custody' has been held, as earlier observed, to include surveillance, restriction or restraint by the police,\" the Court added. \nTherefore, it dismissed the appeal challenging the conviction and sentence of the appellant.\nSenior Advocate Colonel R Balasubramanian with advocates D Kumanan, Raghav Gupta, Y William Vinoth Kumar and Ram Sankar appeared for the accused (appellant). \nAdvocates Aravindh S, Abbas and Kavya Geetha represented the Tamil Nadu government."}
{"ID": "id_996", "Summary": "The Delhi High Court recently directed mediation centres in the national capital to ensure that the mediated settlement agreements are prepared in Hindi as far as possible in addition to the English [Sh Chhater Pal & Ors v State & Anr].\nJustice Swarana Kanta Sharma said that she is passing the order because in majority of the cases, the parties do not comprehend English and their mother tongue is Hindi.\n“This Court also remains conscious of the fact that the majority of litigants who approach this Court and the Courts below speak Hindi as their first language… However, the mediated settlement agreements in Delhi are drafted only in English. In such a scenario, the settlement agreement and the conditions thereof may not always be adequately clear to the parties and at times, the translation from English to Hindi may not convey exactly what the parties intend to do,” the Court said.\nJustice Sharma said that she hopes that once the agreements are written in Hindi, wherever required, it will ensure not only finality of agreements in the mediation centers but also its successful culmination in courts of law.\nIn a detailed judgment dealing with a case of a matrimonial dispute, the Court also passed a series of guidelines to be followed by mediators in drafting a settlement agreement in matrimonial disputes.\nThe judge said that while drafting clauses related to criminal proceedings initiated by either side, the mediator must specify the names of all the parties to the agreement.\nThe Court further said that the agreement must avoid ambiguous terms like ‘respondents’ or ‘petitioners’ and include the terms and conditions of the agreement reached between the parties, howsoever minute and small they may be.\n“The timeline of the fulfilment of terms and conditions as well as their execution must be clearly mentioned. There should be no tentative dates as far as possible. A default clause should be incorporated in the agreement and the consequences thereof should be explained and enlisted in the agreement itself,” Justice Sharma said.\nThe judge further stated that the agreement should also specify the mode of payment and specify as to which follow-up documents are to be signed by which party.\n“Further, especially in cases of matrimonial disputes, where one of the conditions in the Agreement is to cooperate in quashing of FIR, such as those under Section 498A IPC, and filing of affidavit and appearing in the Court for the purpose of the same, it is advisable that the agreement must stipulate the names of all the parties concerned who have been named in the FIR specifically and the fact that the claims have been settled in totality for quashing of entire FIR and proceedings emanating therefrom qua all persons named in the FIR,” the judge underscored.\nShe added,\n“It be also clarified specifically that the FIR will be quashed in totality against all the persons arrested, not arrested, chargesheeted, not chargesheeted, with their names and whether the entire FIR will be quashed against all of them upon payment by husband or any other person on behalf of the husband.”\nThe Court also said that criminal complaints or cross-cases filed by the parties must find specific mention in the agreement and it should necessarily mention that all parties have read and understood the settlement agreement in their vernacular language.  \n“In case only one or some parties are present during mediation proceedings and only their signatures are obtained on the agreement, it be clearly mentioned and clarified that the agreement is being signed on behalf of those relatives or parties also even in case they are not present.”\nJustice Sharma also said that language used in the agreement must be definite enough to understand the real intention of the parties and the goals they wish to achieve through it.\nThe Court directed that this judgment should be forwarded to in-charge, Delhi High Court Mediation and Conciliation Centre (SAMADHAN) as well as concerned in-charge of all the mediation centres in all District Courts of Delhi, for taking note and ensuring compliance.\n“A copy be also forwarded to Director (Academics), Delhi Judicial Academy,” the Court directed.\nAdvocate PK Anand appeared for the petitioners in the case.  \nAdditional Public Prosecutor Satish Kumar appeared for the State.\nAdvocates Shanta Pandey, Hiren Dasan and Preeti Chauhan appeared for the other respondents."}
{"ID": "id_997", "Summary": "The Supreme Court on Friday passed an interim order giving its green signal to proceed with the counselling for NEET postgraduate (PG) courses for the year 2021 [Neil Aurelio Nunes v. Union of India].\nA Bench of Justices DY Chandrachud and AS Bopanna directed that the counselling be held as per the existing criteria for reservation of 27 percent for Other Backward Classes (OBC) and 10 percent for Economically Weaker Section (EWS) in All India Quota (AIQ) seats in State government medical institutions.\n\"The criteria for the determination of the EWS notified by OM 2019 shall be used for identifying the EWS category for candidates who appeared for the NEET-PG 2021 and NEET-UG 2021 examinations; The validity of the criteria determined by the Pandey Committee for identification of EWS would prospectively for the future be subject to the final result of the petitions,\" the order said.\nThe Court also upheld the 27 percent quota for OBC. The validity of criteria for determining EWS quota will be heard at length by the Court later in March this year.\nThe order effectively has the following implications: \n- NEET PG counselling for 2021-22 will be held as per the existing criteria for determining reservation for OBC and EWS.\n- The 27 percent OBC reservation quota has been upheld and settled. There won't be further hearing on this aspect. \n- The criteria for determining EWS reservation criteria will be heard at length by the Court in March and the decision of the Court on the same will apply prospectively to future admissions.\nThe case relates to petitions challenging reservation for OBC and EWS introduced by the Central government in the AIQ seats in State government medical institutions.\nOne of the aspects the Court is specifically examining is the feasibility of having ₹8 lakh as a cap to avail the EWS quota for PG medical admissions.\nDuring the hearing of the case on October 25, the Central government had assured the Court that the counselling for PG medical courses will not start till the Court decides the matter.\nThe Central government had subsequently told the Supreme Court on November 25 that it is proposing to revisit the criteria for determining the EWS reservation. It then constituted an expert committee for the same.\nThe ongoing counselling process for NEET PG courses has been put on hold due to the case and this led to doctors in Delhi protesting against the government demanding that the hearing of the case be expedited and the counselling and admission process be completed as early as possible.\nThe Centre filed an affidavit before the top court on January 1, stating that it has decided to stick to the existing criteria of ₹8 lakh annual income limit for determination of EWS reservation with respect to the ongoing admissions to the NEET PG courses.\nThe Centre informed the top court that the expert committee constituted by the government to reassess the criteria suggested that the existing criteria may be continued for ongoing admissions, while the revised criteria suggested by the committee may be adopted from the next admission cycle.\nThe protests by doctors also prompted the Centre to seek an early hearing in the matter due to which the case came to be listed this week."}

They were in the process of shutting down the plant as they were closing their business for commercial reasons. \nIn its interim application seeking urgent possession of the manufacturing plant, Biovet made the following arguments:\nThat there were only three manufacturers in the country capable of producing COVID vaccine and Biovet being an associate of Bharat Biotech was one of them;\nThat there is shortage of this vaccine and the present manufacturing plant of Biovet is unable to meed the demands;\nThat Intervet was still using the manufacturing unit and had agreed to hand over the plant to Biovet to enhance its vaccine production.\nAdvocate General Ashutosh Kumbhakoni appearing for the State submitted that while they had no objecting to Biotech using the plant for production of Covaxin, they did not want Biovet to claim equity on the basis of this permission during the final hearing of the petition. \nBiovet filed an affidavit-cum-undertaking to this effect stating that they will use the unit for manufacturing Covaxin used for COVID-19 and not claim equity of the permission granted now during the final hearing of the plea. \nKumbhakoni also stated that the State departments will co-operate for grant of any permission, if required to start manufacturing activities. \n\"The application filed by Biovet will be decided without wasting time, considering the present COVID-19 position in Maharashtra,\" he submitted. \nThe Court, therefore, proceeded to allow the application considering the fact that applicants are ready and willing to start manufacturing activity and the State was not objecting to the application. \nAdvocates Prathamesh Kamat, Zoeb Cuterwala and Vikram Kamath instructed by Phoenix Legal appeared for Intervet.\nAdvocates RD Soni and Sujay Gawde instructed by Shree and Co. appeared for Biovet.\nAdvocate General was assisted by Advocate Akshay Shinde and Government Pleader PP Kakade."}
{"ID": "id_999", "Summary": "The Karnataka High Court recently set aside a single-judge order directing the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) to reconsider a woman’s application for details of her husband’s Aadhaar card under the Right to Information Act (RTI Act).\nThe division bench of Justice Sunil Dutt Yadav and Justice Vijaykumar A Patil also observed that a relationship in the form of marriage does not eclipse the right to privacy of a person, which is also recognised under the Aadhaar Act.\n“The right to privacy of Aadhaar number holder preserves the autonomy of the individual’s right to privacy which is conferred primacy and admits of no exception under the statutory scheme. The relationship by marriage which is a union of two partners does not eclipse the right to privacy which is the right of an individual and the autonomy of such individual’s right stands recognized and protected by the procedure of hearing contemplated under Section 33,” the Court said.\nThe Court reasoned that such a right is protected by the procedure of hearing contemplated under Section 33 of Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act, 2016.\nSection 33 allows a High Court judge to order for the disclosure of identity information or authentication records after providing opportunity of hearing to the UIDAI and the Aadhaar number holder.\n“The marriage by itself does not do away with the procedural right of hearing conferred under Section 33 of Aadhaar Act,” the Court held.\nIn this case, the division bench concluded that the single-judge could not have remitted the matter to the UIDAI as the power of holding a hearing and arriving at a decision under Section 33 is vested with a court not inferior to a High Court.\n“The marriage by itself does not do away with the procedural right of hearing conferred under Section 33 of Aadhaar Act. Aadhaar Act, which lays emphasis on the importance to the right to privacy and the same cannot be diluted by delegating the same to an inferior Authority,\" the Court explained. \nThe order was passed in a case where a woman sought the Aadhaar details of her husband with whom she was engaged in a matrimonial dispute. \nA family court had earlier directed her husband to pay her and their daughter a certain amount of monthly maintenance. \nHowever, the woman could not enforce the maintenance order as the whereabouts of her husband were not known. Therefore, she had approached the UIDAI under the Right to Information Act (RTI) for information related to the address details in her husband’s Aadhaar. The UIDAI said that only a High Court judge can take a decision on this issue.\nIn February this year, a single judge of the Karnataka High Court directed the UIDAI to issue notice to the woman’s husband and after hearing him, reconsider the wife's RTI application. The UIDAI challenged the order in an appeal before the division bench of the High Court.\nThe division bench concluded that the matter could not have been sent back to the UIDAI and that it could only have been heard by the High Court or a superior court. \nThe division bench, therefore, remitted the case back to the single-judge. The division bench also said that the woman’s husband should be arrayed as a respondent in the case.\n“A copy of the order is to be marked to the Registrar, High Court of Karnataka, Bengaluru for necessary attention,” the division bench added.\nAdvocate Shivraj S Balloli represented the appellants, the Deputy Director General and the Central Public Information officer of the UIDAI.\nAdvocate Mallikarjunswamy B Hiremath represented the respondent (wife)."}
